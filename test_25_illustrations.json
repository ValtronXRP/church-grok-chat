Right about then a guy in the audience who had been the town drunk, but he had gotten saved — radically saved — and he was sober. He came up to the platform and as he's walking up the man realized, oh you have a question. He said yeah, and he came up and he had an orange in his hand. The ex-drunk is peeling and eating the orange and he gets up on the stage and the man said, well what's your question? He goes, oh just one second, it's not quite done. He eats the last part of his orange and says, okay so my question is this — was the orange I just ate sweet or sour? The guy said, you idiot, how would I know? I've never tasted it. He goes, exactly right. Then how can you tell me that Jesus Christ is a lie when you've never met him? You've never experienced the new life, but I have.

    "summary": "As a new 14-year-old Christian, Pastor Bob signed up for a free magazine from a TV Bible teacher. His youth pastor Gary saw it on the coffee table and recognized it as cult material — protecting young Bob from being led astray by false teaching that sounded authoritative.",
    "full_text": "I was a Christian for less than a year. I was in eighth grade, ninth grade — maybe 14, 15 years of age. I'd given my life to Christ and God started changing me on the inside. I started caring about spiritual things, having real respect for the Bible. I still didn't know it very well but I loved the Lord, and so anything that was spiritual, I was open to. That could be dangerous. There was this TV show, and this guy was obviously a mature Christian, like a pastor guy. He was teaching the Bible, talking about the Greek and the Hebrew and all this history stuff. I was like, wow! They offered a magazine — it was free. I thought, they're obviously Christians, they're not even asking for money. I'll sign up for that. So I started getting this magazine delivered to my house. I was reading it, didn't understand it at all, but I was kind of fascinated. I'll never forget a guy named Gary. He was following up on me as a young Christian from our church, a youth pastor. He'd come by the house to spend time with me, asking how I was doing. We were talking and he saw the magazine right there on the coffee table. I was actually kind of proud of it — I've got Christian magazines! He said, so what is that? I said, well, that's the magazine 'Plain Truth' and it's all about the Lord and the Bible. Well, Gary recognized it immediately as cult material and helped me understand the difference between real Bible teaching and something that sounds good but leads you astray.",

    "summary": "A group in Pastor Bob's church started reading a book that taught Christians should never ask God for forgiveness since they're already forgiven. They stopped singing certain worship songs and eventually left to form their own church around this one doctrine.",
    "full_text": "I remember years ago there was a book written — I won't tell the guy's name because I'm not going to promote the book. He had a radio program and some people in our small church started listening to his radio program, reading his book. And I noticed they stopped singing during certain of the worship songs. I couldn't figure out why. They finally met with me and said, well here's the problem — in that worship song we're asking God to forgive us. I go, yes, that's true. It was actually Phil Wickham's parents who sang the song, 'Oh Lord, forgive me.' A beautiful song. They wouldn't sing it. I said, what's the problem? They said, well, we have come to understand something we didn't know before — we should never ask God to forgive us. I said, what? They said, no, no, we've learned from this guy that we are forgiven and if we ask God to forgive us when we're already forgiven, we're dishonoring God. And then they formed their own little group, their own little church around this doctrine. You see, it's easy to get off base very, very easily within the church, especially when somebody seems to be speaking with authority.",

    "summary": "The story of Ruth and Naomi — Naomi lost her husband and both sons, and told Ruth to go back to her people. But Ruth's famous response, 'Where you go I will go,' came because she had watched Naomi worship God through tragedy, and it drew her to faith.",
    "full_text": "I think of the story in the Book of Ruth. It's interesting that it's called the Book of Ruth and not the Book of Naomi. Naomi was a Jew from Bethlehem who went with her husband Elimelech to Moab. While they were there, her husband died, and both of her sons died. It's a horrible, sad thing. She changed her name from Naomi, which means pleasant, to Mara, which means bitter. She said, don't call me Naomi, call me Mara, for the Almighty has dealt bitterly with me. But here's what's beautiful — Ruth, her Moabite daughter-in-law, had been watching Naomi worship God through all of that tragedy. And when Naomi said, go back to your people, Ruth gave that famous response: 'Where you go, I will go. Where you lodge, I will lodge. Your people shall be my people, and your God shall be my God.' Faith-filled worship draws others to worship too. Ruth came to faith because she watched Naomi trust God through the worst circumstances imaginable.",

    "full_text": "Think about the priests in the Old Testament. God says, I'm going to separate the waters of the Jordan River so that you can cross. Joshua, with the armies of Israel, you're going to go fight Jericho and take the Promised Land. But the way it's going to work is this: the priests have got to take the Ark of the Covenant, and you're going to have to get your feet wet. You're going to go into that river — and by the way, it was flood time — you're going to trust Me. But I'm not separating the waters until you do what you can do. I'm not asking you to do the miracle. I'm asking you to do what you can do — a few steps of faith. Then I'll move. Jesus reveals Himself to those who step out in faith.",

Offer what Moses requires in the law.' Oh, okay, but we're supposed to do that when we're healed up! Let's go to Jerusalem — that's what Jesus said. And as they went, they were healed. You need to take a step of faith. You want to see God move? He's more than able to move, but He's waiting for you to do what you can do.",
