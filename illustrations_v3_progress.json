Then, when John was heading to the mountains for a youth retreat, he stopped at a gas station and told the attendant, a total stranger, 'Hey, I'm going up to a retreat right now and I could really use some prayer. Would you just pray for me right now? I just want God to use me.' The kid mumbled through a prayer and sent him on his way. Guess who was in church the next Sunday when John was preaching?

He said, 'I believe there is no greater argument for the existence of God in the world today than conscience.' There is no greater proof of the existence of a moral law and law giver in the universe than this little light of the soul. It is God's voice to the inner man.

At first, he was unwilling, but eventually he said to himself that because she bothered him, he would give her justice so she wouldn't wear him out. Jesus concluded that if an unrighteous judge responds, God will surely bring about justice for his elect who cry to him day and night.",

But it offers great hope and encouragement to parents whose children are out in the world and gone, not knowing if they'll even live. The father in the story pictures God himself, who is so gracious that he gives his son his inheritance early, even though he knows it'll be taken and used to dishonor him. The son goes off, wastes it on riotous living and drunkenness, makes friends until he runs out of money, then takes a job feeding pigs\u2014which is humiliating for a Jewish boy. He's so desperate that he wishes he could eat the pig food, realizes his father's servants eat better, and decides to repent, though motivated by his hunger and consequences.",

Moses went up the mountain, died, and God buried him. According to Jewish tradition, after Moses was buried, the Devil appeared to desecrate his body. God sent Michael the Archangel to confront him. Michael, the angel of war who once helped Gabriel in spiritual conflict, disputed with the Devil but did not pronounce a disrespectful judgment himself. Instead, he said, 'The Lord rebuke you,' showing deference to God's authority.",

If you want to know if he loves you so, it's in his kiss.'

In their training, which was among the best in the country, officers were instructed to pick up their spent brass casings after shooting to keep the range clean. This habit carried over into real emergencies, as evidenced at the scene where some officers had brass in their pockets or stacked neatly during the firefight.

However, a popular song boasting 'Saul has slain his thousands, but David his tens of thousands' irritated Saul, leading him to try to kill David twice. David had to flee Israel, and Saul pursued him with the entire army, but David gathered 400 distressed and bitter men around him. These damaged men were transformed over time into a formidable army that fought the Philistines alongside David, even though he wasn't yet king and lacked official support.",

      "text": "Back in the 1950s, there was a man named Peter Stoner, a mathematics professor who wrote a book called Science Speaks. He used compound probability to calculate the chances of biblical prophecies about Jesus being fulfilled by random occurrence. For instance, for eight prophecies, the odds are one in 10 to the 17th power, which is like covering the entire landmass of Texas with silver dollars two feet deep, marking one coin, mixing them, and having a blindfolded cowboy randomly pick the marked one. This shows the extreme rarity of such an event, and for more prophecies, the number grows even larger, requiring comparisons to vast distances like that between Earth and the Sun.",

For 48 prophecies, the odds reach 1 in 10 to the 157th power, which is so vast that we switch to electrons. An electron is incredibly small, about 2.5 quadrillionths of an inch, and even counting them at 250 per minute would take 19 million years to make one inch.",

Peter insisted it wouldn't happen to him, saying the others might deny Jesus but not him, even claiming he'd die for him. Jesus responded by revealing that Satan had requested permission to sift Peter like wheat, but Jesus had prayed for him. This shows Peter as part of the bride, with Jesus speaking up for him despite his failure, just as he does for us today.

He wouldn't take his eyes off it, illustrating that things will return, ready or not. The question is, will you be ready for Jesus' return?",

My wife and I are praying for what's next and dealing with anxieties about the future, like how it will all work out. I have five daughters, so I'm thinking about five weddings and five son-in-laws; I've got one son-in-law already, and he's great, imagining the rest will be too.

The boy grew up in shame, constantly questioned about his father, and isolated from other children who wouldn't play with him. He avoided social situations and even stayed inside during recess to escape mockery. Eventually, a new, loving preacher arrived in town, drawing the boy to church with his charismatic and non-judgmental message about God's love. The boy began to feel hope and warmth in his heart through the preacher's words about Jesus and the Heavenly Father.",

I was in the emergency room with her twice late at night, but they couldn't provide any help, and she underwent MRIs and every test to find the source. It was miserable, like a life sentence for those who endure it, so we kept praying. The Lord provided a doctor, a specialist at the Cleveland Clinic who had joined us on a trip to Israel and attends our church. She offered to fly us out for a three-day evaluation with different doctors, and we were thrilled, thinking this was the answer. Just before we went, after persistent prayer and fasting from some women, my wife woke me up in the middle of the night, crying that the tinnitus was gone.",

Thirty years earlier, an American missionary had left a Bible with two converts, who shared their faith and led the whole town to follow Christ and live by its teachings. They adopted the Ten Commandments as their law and the Sermon on the Mount as their social guide, resulting in no jails, no crime, no divorce, and a high degree of health and happiness. When Hall returned during a battle lull, the village remained a serene oasis, prompting his driver to remark that perhaps the world needed the Bible's weapons more than military ones. This true account highlights the lasting impact of God's Word on a community.",

What was unusual wasn't the drugs or their value, but that the ringleaders were observant Jews who refused to deal drugs during the Sabbath. They regularly warned their clients not to arrive after sundown on Fridays or before sundown on Saturdays, even sending messages like, 'We are closing at 7:30 on the dot and will reopen Saturday at 8:15, so if you need anything, you have 45 minutes to get it.' In one April message to 250 recipients, they emphasized this rule. They might be drug dealers, but at least they remembered the Sabbath day to keep it holy.",

No one was there to receive Henry, which filled him with depression after his years of service. He felt the Lord whisper, 'You're not home yet, Henry.' Later, at the church that sent him, no one was gathered, and his wife urged him to settle it with the Lord, hearing the voice again. That night, he had a vision of heaven where thousands of Africans he had led to Christ welcomed him, and God whispered once more, 'You're not home yet, Henry.'

For since in the wisdom of God the world through its wisdom did not come to know God, God was well-pleased through the foolishness of the message preached to save those who believe.' This quote matters because it highlights that human wisdom alone cannot lead to knowing God, and instead, God uses the simple message of the gospel to save believers. Pastor Bob connects it to show that even brilliant people, like Moses, can't save themselves through their own strength.",

The final 40 years, starting at age 80 when he saw the burning bush, he discovered all that God can do through a nobody like him.",
