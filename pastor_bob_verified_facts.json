      "how_they_met_full_story": {
        "first_meeting": "Bob first met Becky for about 3-4 minutes at the church next to hers years before they dated. He was helping lead a college Sunday School class and would stand by the door inviting college-aged people. She was walking by, said she went to Cal State Fullerton and worked at the Placentia library. She mentioned her boyfriend was waiting in the car.",
        "reconnection_at_library": "Years later, Bob was driving to Talbot Seminary and stopped at the intersection of Chapman and Kramer in Placentia. Out of the blue, 'Becky Cal State Fullerton Placentia library' came into his mind. He wasn't looking for a date. He drove into the library and asked if Becky Olson still worked there - she did. They chatted. She told him she was dating a guy seriously, possibly engaged, heading that direction. He was going to a Lutheran college and into ministry. Bob thought 'praise God' and left it at that.",
        "second_visit": "A month later, sitting at the same intersection, 'Becky' came to mind again. He drove in, she was there, they talked, he asked her out. She said okay. They went to breakfast, prayed together, had a great time as friends.",
        "the_phone_call": "Bob prayed for a week about whether to call her again. Felt nothing specific. Called multiple times - her roommate said she wasn't there. Finally reached her the next morning (woke her up). Asked if she'd like to go out sometime. She said 'what day?' He said 'any day you're free.' She said 'that makes it really hard.' Then he said 'I did need to share something God put on my heart last night.' She said 'when would you like to share that with me?' He said he didn't care. She said 'how about right now?'",
        "the_revelation": "Bob drove over, picked her up, they went out for coffee. At coffee, the Lord revealed to Bob BEFORE Becky told him something he did not know: she had gotten engaged to the other man the night before. She was now engaged.",
        "friendship_period": "They became just friends. Bob encouraged her spiritually. It wasn't romantic. He thought that might be all there was. God was using him in her life.",
        "eventually_dating": "Her engagement ended. They started dating. Three weeks after their first date, Bob felt God telling him to ask her to marry him.",
        "proposal_conflict": "Bob initially resisted because he had taught college-age kids to date for a year then be engaged for a year (based on 'Design for Christian Marriage' by Dwight Harvey Small). But God was telling him to propose after three weeks.",
        "marriage": "They got engaged and married about 3.5 months after their first date. Bob was about 25 when they married. Been together 35+ years as of 2017.",
