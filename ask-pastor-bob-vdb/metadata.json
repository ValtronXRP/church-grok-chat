here today and that's why I asked you to open up your bulletins because there are many more of your attention and consideration but however we want to highlight for today for you to hear about and consider and also don't forget we have highlights on our website that Pastor Bob has created for you uh he addresses not only just what the events are but even the heart behind it and the reason for them whether it's a Ministry or a gathering he's taking time to really record some really high production videos to help explain and share with you the heart behind what we do here so I'd encourage you to check that out on our website or our app but today here are a few things I want you to know about number one is we have our school of discipleship right around the corner uh that is starting in the new year of January 8th and yet we'll start your signups now it's an eight week semester and be a part of classes on Sunday afternoons taught by pastors and people among our fellowship here and what do we want to highlight today is creation versus evolution by Richard Frizzell so in fact he's gonna come up here and share a little bit about it so would you help me walk him up Richard Frizell yeah my my background is in geological walked away from the Lord for about four and a half years Evolution I thought", "um but it's fascinating how the Lord his creation to speak to those who are willing to listen and over the period of time I was given problems along the way as far as what is out there and how do you explain it and finally I bent the knee and surrendered my life and came back to the Lord but I remember thinking to a friend of mine out loud that I regretted that I had lost those four and a half years and he said no no no you didn't lose those years those are just the years that the locusts have eaten and I didn't understand that until he pointed out in Joel chapter 2 25 that God said that he will restore to you the years that the locusts have eaten my class is an opus and those who don't know what that is look it up it's kind of a cool word uh but it is the testimony that the lord gave me to bring me back to him through science and not necessarily God's word it's out there how many of you guys have kids grandkids great grandkids who are either in High School junior high Elementary or college how many of you guys have kids like that I'm talking to you you are not in the line of fire you are not the point of the spirit they are they are the ones that are being Evolution on a daily basis and I would like to have those who have people like that come so that you can speak intelligently to them about what they're being taught in school now mind you I tend to be a little passionate I get a little uh excited when I teach but that's because I am yeah you could hear the giggles in the cloud those are my former students by the way but I do that because it means a lot to me it's personal this is personal I mean I know a lot of people who have a lot of knowledge no no Evolution nearly Shipwrecked my life Shipwrecked my walk I am so thankful that God has been so merciful and gracious to me to draw me back to him and I want to do the same so that your kids don't go through what I did to me ask me questions I'm available and God bless you all and we'll hopefully see some of you my class amen be a part of that class for sure it's a good one we also

church not doing our commitment or obligation but Lord they have a living vital relationship with you and we pray that your spirit who searches the Deep things of God would", "search our hearts and then Reveal Your Heart To Us about your own son so Lord we're here to worship Him and we thank you for this time in Jesus name amen you can be so on Sunday mornings everyone who attends here knows that we're in the New Testament and if if you just brought your new testament to church I doubt anybody did that but maybe you did sorry I should have warned you that we're going to spend a little time over the next few weeks before Christmas which is on a Sunday um looking at some Old Testament passages as well you know um Christmas is kind of well as a holiday been a controversial subject for that may not be your experience but historically it is because Christmas really wasn't celebrated by the church until about the fifth century did you know that obviously Resurrection was um Easter what we call now Easter some of us uh call it Easter but not Christmas that was not a celebrated holiday in the church for about 400 years that may surprise you but then began to be celebrated and and finally attached through the Roman Emperor to the dates that we use now but it's interesting to me that actually Christmas struggled a lot as a celebration throughout the years actually in the 17th century do you know that Christmas was actually outlawed um yeah it was uh not the uh the Grinch that stole Christmas it was the government under uh Oliver Cromwell they the problem was that this season was also associated with a lot of drunkenness and debauchery which that that's still true unfortunately and so there were Puritans who affected the British government and said this is something that is Pagan we shouldn't be celebrating it so they wanted nothing to do with it so they made it against the law by the way that also happened then through the influence of the Puritans in Boston uh in the colonies and for 22 years it was against the law here in the United States or at least in Boston if you showed Christmas spirit you could get fined five Shillings uh I don't know who decided yep that's enough Christmas spirit to find you um so I want to talk a little bit about kind of the history of Christmas but not from that perspective over the next few I don't even want to just go back to the new testament which we will certainly do on Christmas Day I want to go back to the Old Testament so I want to go all the way back to the", "beginning of the beginnings of all things you know that is what the word Genesis means many of you know that the names of our Old Testament certain of the Old Testament books are from not Hebrew but Greek and Genesis literally from the Greek word means the beginning the the birth or the start of all things and so we're going to see today some things from Genesis about Christmas now usually Bible studies on Christmas don't go to Genesis but I hope you'll see why I wanted to do that today so the first verse is going to be in Genesis 2 7 but if you're taking notes I've got a lot of passages to share not just one from one um put this down Jesus is the seed of redemption from sin and from Satan put in the word sin and Satan and in Genesis 2 7 we have this verse then the Lord God formed man of dust from the ground and he breathed into his nostrils the breath of life and Man became a living being in that same chapter in verse 17 God gives instructions as to what they could eat but from the Tree of the knowledge of Good and Evil you shall not eat for in the day that you eat from it you will surely die when it comes to uh in Genesis one of my titles before I settled on the Genesis of Christmas was the seeds of Christmas from this book and I want to talk a little bit about how the beginning of the creation of man and from the the first book of the Bible we see some foreshadowings of the Christmas story so put this down Christ is born to make a new life available Christ is the seed of man and when I say man I mean man and woman okay God created Man In His Image male and female he created them if you go to the New Testament and you look at the two genealogies one in Matthew and one in Luke you see that they describe Christ's biological and legal descendants Matthew focuses on his audience he's talking to Jews who are waiting for the Messiah the king to come prophesied in the Old Testament so Matthew traces the lineage the legal lineage of Jesus down from Abraham through David because the Messiah had to be the son of Abraham to fulfill the promises that God made to Abraham and also the son of David he had to be the son of the royal line of David that he might be the king of the Jews", "when you get to the Book of Luke this is found in chapter three Luke does something a little different Luke actually traces Jesus's genealogy all the way back past David and past Abraham all the way back to Adam and really to God it's very very interesting to me you need to remember that Luke is not writing to a Jewish audience Luke was not Jewish Luke remember the The Physician that accompanied Paul on his missionary Journeys was actually Greek and Luke writing after Matthew has written the story of Jesus for Jews basically decides to add more to the story not that it was you know fiction but he added details that he had and so he basically says it's true what Matthew wrote but wait there's still more and he wants to tell us that Jesus is also obviously not just come as the Jewish Messiah he has come to seek and save that which is lost Luke has a heavy emphasis on for instance the parables are only found in the Gospel of Luke that Parable that Jesus told of the lost sheep the Lost coin and then the lost son article of the lost son when he records the salvation of Zacchaeus the chief tax collector there in Jericho he records Jesus as saying that he has come to seek and save that which was lost it's not just the lawsuit of the House of Israel it's lost Mankind and so at the end of The Book of Luke in chapter 24 he records Jesus is saying that they are to go out and preach the gospel to all the nations of the world and of course Luke writes the book of Acts where Jesus gives that command for the gospel to go out to the whole world you know every single Church probably has a lost and found ours is in the hallway right behind this wall if you've left your Bible it's probably there unless somebody said I'd Finders Keepers whatever I don't know it's probably there a jacket every church has a lost and found somewhere the fact is every Sunday morning every Wednesday night our lost and found is right here in this room I don't know which you are God does and I don't know if you even know for sure which category you're in but I pray to God that today by the end of today you know for sure where you stand in relationship to the Lord Jesus came to seek and saved that which was lost but he was born to make a new life available not just for the Jews but for", "anyone that's Luke 3 and verse 38 if you want to jot down these verses as we go as Luke records the lineage or the genealogy of Jesus he ends by saying he is the son of enosh the son of Seth the son of Adam and the son we will sing I'm sure at some point in this Christmas season the words from Hark the Herald Angels Sing which include these words mild he lays his glory by born that man no more may die Born to Raise the sons of Earth born to give them second birth Adam then becomes our picture our first picture of the seeds of Christmas or the Genesis of Christmas jot down Romans 5 and verse 18. Romans 5 and verse 18 Paul makes this analogy between Adam and Christ he said so then as through one transgression referring to Adam's sin there resulted condemnation to all men even so through one act of righteousness that resulted justification of the life to all men he's making this analogy between Adam and Christ the Bible refers to Jesus as the last Adam there was the first Adam and by the way Adam it's interesting the original man was given a test in a garden and he totally failed the test he sinned he was one thing he couldn't do he said what is that I'll do it now I know the his wife was involved some of us think when I get to heaven I'm going to say what were you thinking happy wife happy I don't know what he's going to say the answer to that you should never blame Adam for your sin or for sin in this what was his fault though actually Adam was our champion if you had been there you would have sinned sooner because he actually you couldn't have gotten any better of a person in intern he was sinless he had everything going for him you and I would have made the same decision don't blame Adam for the decisions that you make yes he gave us and we inherited a sin nature from him but this idea that Adam made a decision that affected everybody that's connected with him after that is true it's called headship Federal headship theologically but the point that Paul will make is just as Adam affected all of his descendants and all that are tied to him so did Christ jot it down first Corinthians 15 and so also it is written the first Adam the first man Adam became a living Soul we just read that the last atom a reference to Christ became a life-giving", "Spirit you see the first Adam was given a test there in the garden and he bombed the test he was the first atom bomb you might say he blew it but our Lord and savior comes and tested in all points as we are the lust of the flesh the lust of the eyes and the pride of life the very things that Eve gave the last atom was successful not only in the Temptation in the wilderness but then in another Garden to say if it'd be possible let this cup pass from me he refused to go his way and accepted the will of God that he go to the Cross you see he is the last Adam and he is successful where the first Adam used to say in his messages as he would call people to Salvation nobody can go back and make a new start but anybody can start now to make a new end I like that it's true many of us can look back on our lives I say I wish I was different when I was growing up I was wish I wasn't involved with those people or doing those things I wish I hadn't destroyed maybe your first marriage or your children's attitude toward you we have a we can live with a lot of Regrets We cannot go back we can admit that we did wrong sometimes we did we failed to do that I usually tell people you can't go back and do it right once you've blown it but you could do right about what you did wrong that's sometimes all we can do I gotta admit that I did wrong if I'm going to start doing right right now a lot of people struggle with even doing that but I like what Billy Graham says you really can't go back and make a new start but anybody can start now to make a new end and this is really the testimony of what Christ comes to do into our lives you see Jesus dies on a cross to save us the Bible says to save us from what well at least these three things he died to save us from the penalty of sin which is really if you think about it Eternal but he also died to save us from the power of sin right now which is its habitual domination in our life that's what Romans 6 is about we don't have to live anymore the way we used to live that doesn't mean we don't sin but it means that sin will no longer be Master but he also died", "to deal with the product of sin what's that that's a continual vexation of fear of dying that's built into the human race put this down he's the seed also of who brings that is Christ does freedom he brings Freedom jot down Genesis 3 and verse 15. by the way Genesis 3 15 is sometimes called The proto-uon Galleon Proto means first you on Galleon is the word for gospel so it's referred to as the first mention of the Gospel in the Bible and here in the curse put on the serpent after the serpent tested Eve God said to the serpent I will put enmity between you and the woman and between your seed and her seed and then he refers to her seed he shall bruise you on the head and you shall bruise or crush him on the heel very interesting what in the world is he talking about the seed of the woman and the seed of the serpent by the way the seed of the serpent we know is every person who rejects Christ remember Jesus in John 8 said you are of your father the devil you want to do the Deeds of your father he was a murderer and a liar from the beginning and you're trying to kill me a man who's telling you the truth that is the seed of the serpent but he talks about this enmity that would be happening between the seed of The Serpent and the seed of the woman and this is a reference ultimately to the Cross of Christ that Jesus would come he is the seed of the woman the promised one that would come and while Satan will attack him he will if you will like a serpent biting the heel which certainly would hurt but wouldn't he will bite at his heels if you will and we see Christ on the cross he dies but with that same heel he crushes the head of the serpent even through the cross so jot down Galatians 4 verses 4 Paul says but when the fullness of the time came God sent forth his son born of a woman that's Genesis 3 15 born under the law in order that he might redeem those who were under Christmas is a time of celebrating the coming of Christ but from the very beginning we see that God knew that man would fail before he did and made a way made a provision for him to be saved by the way when it talks about those who are under the law we often think well that's the Jews that", "are under the law actually the Bible says all men are under the law jot down Romans 3 and verse 19. Romans 3 19. now we know that whatever the law says it speaks to those who are under the law in order that every mouth may be closed and notice all the world not just the Jews but all the world might become to God so Jesus comes to be born he is the seed of man who is the last Adam and he is the promised seed of the woman who Redemption by crushing the serpent on the head then this is most important put this down see that his victory has now become yours if you're in Christ jot down Romans 16 and verse 20. and the God of Peace Paul says to the church at Rome will soon Crush Satan under your feet very interesting God will CR this is the application of what Genesis 3 15 said but now it's not just something Jesus is going to do 2000 years ago Paul is talking to Christians Jesus has already died he says hey that crushing isn't just something Jesus did historically on the cross for everyone it's something he wants to do right now in your life personally we need to realize this that Jesus died but what death did to Christ is nothing compared to what Christ did to death amen do you understand that there's a we sometimes agree oh he died and so yes Good Friday is hard for us to think about the torture that was done to Jesus that he didn't deserve but we need to realize the implications of what Christ did on the cross and how it applies the benefits to ourselves Hebrews 2 verses 14 and 15 talk about that since then the children and by the way the phrase the children means people who are born into a human into Humanity since then the children share in Flesh and Blood he himself likewise also partook of the same that is he this is the Incarnation he became a man that through death he might render powerless him who had the power of death that is the devil and might deliver those who through fear of death were subject to slavery all of their lives this is what the Lord did you know I was just talking to somebody before service and we were talking about how so many people live this life even sometimes Christians but definitely those who don't know the Lord and this life is all focused on well this life and there's almost no thought of the", "afterlife almost none it's so vague it's almost not it's almost like who knows and and yet a Believer is walking by the spirit of God starts thinking a lot more of Heaven now I do believe the older we get the more we think of Heaven as Believers I think sometimes people as they get older sometimes become more open to the fact that hey wait a minute this life is going to end and even I think to myself as a Christian I was thinking as we are worshiping you know the Bible says we're to redeem the time for the days of evil I often think about but I don't just want to redeem the day I want to learn how to redeem the hour I remember seeing a movie years ago someone's going to remember I don't remember what movie it was but there was somebody it was a man he was the husband of the father and I think he had a basically a terminal illness and I remember in the movie he was trying to figure out the fastest way to save time so he could use his time more wisely and he had a stopwatch and he was buttoning his shirt this way and then he would time and he would button his shirt the other way to see which he could do faster and he was doing all these things to figure how can I save time you know where it's running out for every one of us the time is gonna run out and the closer you get to the end I think the more you realize my life Lord whatever it's going to be on this Earth I only get one it's soon going to be done and some of us aren't too excited about the way we've lived so far in terms of Eternity and maybe we're Believers and as it gets closer we say oh man I I want my life redeemed I want to use whatever's left you know you think of the story for instance in the Bible of redemption and you think of the Book of Ruth that whole book is about Redemption about the Kinsmen Redeemer the the goel that that God put in the law that could redeem a woman's life here's Naomi she loses her husband she loses her two sons she lost everything she had nothing and you know what her story really you think of job who lost all of his wealth all of his reputation and the Bible doesn't really concern itself with what leads up so job's great life up", "till the no it is it is Devastation and his huge loss so you get in chapters one and two God's work of redemption begins so many times late in a person's life in terms of the damage that's been done and it's possible you're here and your story hasn't even started but it can it could start today if you're willing to at the end of my message I'm going to give you an opportunity to say I want the Redemption that Christ came to bring the Redemption from sin and from Satan and from Death I want that in my life because right now Pastor Bob I do live with a fear of death I live with a question mark about afterlife I don't even know if there is one but if there is one I want to be in you know uh I know as we get on in life we start thinking about exercise more and trying to so you know some of us like I'm never going back to the gym don't even ask me I remember hearing Pastor Chuck once say you know sometimes when you get older you get to a point where you're just being more honest with yourself you know and I realized I used to say to myself I could get back in shape I I could still do it because I've now realized I'm never going to get back in he goes to some of you are going to come up afterwards like oh you can do a passion please don't come up you know according to a recent study on physical exercise for every hour you do cycling you gain an extra hour of life they said but think about it the hour you gain is the hour you wasted being hot sweaty and out of breath now for the five of you that have never heard this story 90 year old couple married almost 65 years they died in a they had been in good health the last 10 years mainly due to the wife's interest health food and exercise when they get to the Pearly Gates Peter took them to their mansion which was decked out with a beautiful kitchen master bath suite and jacuzzi this is a true story as they oohed and awed the old man asked Peter how much all this was going to cost he said it's it's free this is heaven next I went out to survey the championship golf course that the home backed up to they would have golfing privileges every day and each week the course changed to a new one representing", "the great golf courses on Earth the old man asked well beautiful but what are the green fees Peter replies this is heaven you play for free next they went to the clubhouse and they saw the lavish buffet lunch with the Cuisines of the world laid out how much to eat ask the old man don't you don't you understand yet this is heaven it's free Peter replied with some well where are the low-fat and low cholesterol tables the old man asked timidly Peter lectured that's the best part you can eat as much as you like of whatever you like and you never get fat and you'll never get sick this is heaven with that the old man went into a fit of anger throwing down his hat and stomping on it and shrieking wildly Peter and his wife both tried to calm him down asking him what was wrong the old man looked at his wife and said this is all your fault if it weren't for your blasted bran muffins I could have been here 10 years like I said it's a true story but isn't it wonderful as a believer to realize that the very worst thing that man can imagine happening is the very thing that sends us to Paul said for me to live as Christ and to die is gain and to go to heaven is far better if you haven't heard Mike Swanson Pastor Mike Swanson's sermon Heaven is better you you need to hear it to be with the Lord who we've never seen but we've met and loved finally to see him face to face to be with our saved loved ones and I've often said it the older I get the more I feel like I know more people there than because they multiply up there of how that I know and miss no Disobedience anymore no more sorrow no more crying I believe when a Spirit-filled believer faces death they don't worry did remember what to John in Revelation chapter 1. John Falls as a dead man before Jesus says he sees him in his glory and he says fear not for though I was dead now I'm alive then he says this I have the keys of death in Hades I own it you know what there are a lot of you in this room and you have given Jesus your failings and your sins you've given him that praise God and there are plenty of us in this room who are trying and are willing to give him our current circumstances of our life but still there are some in our", "room who have never put him really in charge or seen him in charge of our he's in charge of your death he's got the keys to death your death he's the one who's going to decide when it's going to happen he's paved and paid away for you to be with him forever you need to believe that it'll set you free one of the gifts of Christ's coming was to set us free from the fear of death the fear of death of our loved ones some of us are more afraid of losing our loved ones than we are facing death ourselves I'd rather die than lose my loved one God doesn't give you a right to do that if you've lost a loved one and they're in God's presence grieve but not as those who have no hope celebrate where they are and realize it's going to be soon you'll be back with them some of us have children or grandchildren in heaven we've never met it's a family reunion you know it's interesting to me reading the Christmas stories the various uh elements of the birth of Christ in the gospels how many strangers are brought to Mary and Joseph they go to just dedicate Jesus in the temple which is what they needed to do according to the law now for the sacrifice and and the Bible says that this old man named Simeon comes up to them he seems to know who Jesus is and you have Anna they don't know it's not like these are friends or neighbors of Joseph and they're total strangers but they're brought into the story The Lord's kind of by his Spirit showing them who Jesus is how about the night that Jesus is born those Shepherds it's not like Joseph and Mary went hi this is zedekiah they didn't know these Shepherds this is the very night Jesus is born and they're knocking at their door hey Angel said on us we wanted to come in worse are the wise men for that man these are complete strangers and I do believe as you come into a relationship with Lord the Lord has an intention to bring people into your life and into our life and into this church we don't know you yet maybe it's your first time here you've never come to this church and it's not because of us but because of the Lord he brought you here today so that you might well you're a stranger but only for one service because you're going to be family today as you say I want to receive Jesus as my savior and", "my Lord but his victory number three has now become yours put this down letter B he's the seed from whom all blessings put in the word blessings because we go now from the seed of man and the seed of and we now go to the seat of Abraham Genesis 22 here's what God Said to Abraham and in your seed all the nations of the Earth shall be blessed now remember Abraham was childless and his concern was he wouldn't even have an heir because he was an older man and his wife was elderly and they had never had any children and the one to inherit all of his wealth would be his servant and so God blessed him of course with the birth of Isaac but before that he gave him this vision of the stars and he said look at the stars Abraham can you count the stars because your descendants are going to be like the stars of the heaven beyond the ability to count them and so many people when they read that verse about in your seat all the families of the Earth shall be blessed think it's a reference to the nation of Israel to the of Abraham but we're told in the New Testament by the way the best commentary on the Bible is the Bible if you want to understand your Bible just read more of it and we know who the Seed of Abraham is because the New Testament gives us the answer to who is that is that the nation of Israel jotted down it's Galatians 3 and verse 16. Paul the Holy Spirit inspires him to write this now the promises were spoken to Abraham and to his seed he does not say and to his seeds as referring to many but rather to one and to your seed that is Christ and so we don't have to guess about who this seed is of Abraham that will bless all the nations of the world so put this down see yourself as God's beloved as God's beloved receiver Ephesians 1 and verse 3 Paul says this blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ who has blessed us with every spiritual blessing in the Heavenly now I was born and raised in a different actually not just a different Century but in a different millennium that makes me feel really old but late night TV there was only one guy locally that seemed to have bought up most of the commercials for his used cars I'll eat a bug I'll stay on my head but if you want a good deal go see", "cow now somebody going what is that well you didn't miss much but when Cal Worthington and his dog spot which changed over the years what that was but anyway he would he would introduce these different models of car on late night TV this car you want this particular car it'd be this kind of local TV and uh and I remember he would go through the various things that that car had because you see back then it wasn't like now when you buy a car and there aren't choices now I don't know if there are I know some car just like that you want it or not because it comes with everything you're paying for everything or don't bother us I mean you but back then like you want windows that are electric you know that's more money you want power steering or do you want to use all your power to steer it you know the you know what I mean and so every model had and uh you know there was the luxury version that you paid more money for but I remember calworthy would always bring these these these uh vehicles on him and say this one is fully loaded he would use that again it's fully loaded and I so that's a car that has everything you can buy well I always think about that when I think about Psalm 68 and verse 19 you go I'm wondering where this is going to tie in Psalm 68 verse 19 here's what the psalmist said blessed be the Lord who daily loadeth us with benefits even the god of our Salvation God only has fully loaded models when it comes to Christians if you're a Christian you've got everything that's available it's already yours in Christ stop thinking somebody else got all the blessings and I wish I got theirs and I wish I got his or I wish I got hers you got everything that God gives to us in Christ I had a whenever he was a Christian and whenever I'd be at his house and I would be leaving and say oh God bless you and he would always say the exact maybe you know something like this they'd always say the same thing whenever you say God bless even if they sneeze so God bless you he does that was always his answer he does it got a little irritating to be honestly but that's okay but but reality was every Christian should answer when somebody says God bless you you should be able to answer he has he does", "and I know he will again you see I have another friend whenever you say uh how are you doing he says better than I and I think man amen to that every spiritual blessing in the Seed of Abraham that's Christ that which is born of Abraham that's Jesus is to be the source of every blessing and can I say to you every blessing in my life every this is what I said last week in James 1 17 every good gift see I didn't realize it before I was saved I didn't realize it for many years after I was saved every good thing has one source and that's the Lord Do You Believe do you know that God was blessing you before you got saved God didn't go I'm going to just be up here and ignore you and tell you now and bless you doesn't work that way he chose you before the foundation of the world he's blessed you with people in your life to get you ready to receive Christ he blessed You by protecting you from all the sin you committed before you knew him and getting what you deserve see you know sometimes people know I was a cop they don't know so many times I've been in the back seat of that same police car before after I was saved by the way yeah you say tell me that story nope okay my grandchildren always tell me a cop story where you did that wrong thing you know I was like nope don't tell you those okay letter C he's the seed who redeems our greatest sorrows our greatest Sorrows jot down Genesis 35 verses 16 through 19. this is the Journey of Jacob and his family as they are returning from those 20 years with Laban back to the promised land back to Canaan it says then they journeyed from Bethel you remember Bethel that's the Jacob's Ladder where he first meets the Lord they journeyed from Bethel and when there was still some distance to go to ephrath Rachel now remember Rachel is his beloved wife that he worked for for seven years that he fell in love with and of course he winds up with Leah too you know that story but Rachel began to and she suffered severe labor and it came about when she was in severe labor that the Midwife said to her do not fear for now you have another son remember Joseph is the older she now has her second born son and it came about as her Rachel's Soul was departing for she that she named him Ben Oni", "but his father called him Benjamin Benjamin that's very interesting story Rachel dies giving birth to her second and last son is encouraged by the Midwife that this hard labor yes but it's worth it because now you have a second son God has blessed you but she realizes she's dying and giving birth to him by the way that whole account the next part of the verse says this happened in Bethlehem this whole story happens in Bethlehem it's the first mention of Bethlehem in the Bible certainly not the last mention but it's interesting to me what happens there this Genesis of Christmas put this down he is Born the son of my sorrows you know I think not only of Rachel but I think of Mary in the New Testament who was told this in Luke 2 verses 34 and 35 Simeon that old man and the temple when baby Jesus was being dedicated Simeon blessed Mary and Joseph and Jesus and said to Mary his mother behold this child is appointed for the fall and Rise of many in Israel and for a sign to be opposed notice this and a sword will pierce even your own soul to the end that the thoughts from many hearts may be revealed you know um when it comes to this birth of this baby this precious little boy he is initially called by his mother the son of my sorrows and of course we can see Christ in this pretty clearly jotted down Isaiah 53 verses 3 and 4. it says of Christ he was despised and forsaken of men a Man of Sorrows and acquainted with grief and like one from whom men hide their face he was despised and we did not esteem him but surely our griefs he himself bore and our sorrows he carried yet we ourselves esteemed him stricken smitten of God and afflicted it's been said that Jesus is recorded in this gospels as weeping actually three times Jesus we know we'd only wet more than that but three times it's recorded that he wept but there is no recording in this gospels of him laughing it's not that Jesus didn't but it's this awareness that when Jesus came he came as a man of Sorrows and of course he came to bear our sorrows put this down though his father calls him the son of my right you see Benjamin that's what it means Ben Sun Yamin right and so while Ben Oni or Benjamin when he's first born is called the son of my sorrows yet the father will change his name to the son of the right hand", "and Isaiah 53 verses 10 and 11 after talking about the sorrow and the suffering of the Christ says but the Lord was pleased to crush him putting him to grief if he would render himself offspring he'll prolong his days and the good pleasure of the Lord will prosper in his hand as a result of the anguish of his soul he will see it and be satisfied and by his knowledge the righteous one my servant will justify the many and he will bear their iniquities simply put it's worth it to Jesus for the joy set before him he endured the cross why so that he could have you and me with him in heaven as we look back at Christmas we need to go back to the beginning and we see that the Lord has a plan to bring the seed of man and the seed of a woman and ultimately do what Adam failed to do and to fulfill the promise that Satan's head would be crushed in our lives then we see in the Book of Genesis through Abraham that there would be one person he will be the seed from whom all the families of the earth will be blessed not just the religious not just the righteous not just the Jews but anyone and everyone who will say I want to know the Lord and then he is the one who redeems us from our greatest Sorrows not just from our sins but from the hard things that have happened as our brother just shared in the Book of Joel he will restore the years that the locusts have eaten he will give us a Garment of Praise for those ashes that we have put this down finally then and this is my challenge to everyone here who's never given their life to Christ except Pascal's wager you say who's what Pascal's wager put in the word wager maybe you know the name Blaise Pascal some of us do perhaps you've heard of him he was a famous philosopher and he was also a believer in Jesus Christ he's the one who by the way is quoted so often as saying that God created man with a god-shaped void in every single heart that only Christ can fit every person was made with this missing piece and is to discover if they will that Christ Alone can fill it but he once made a wager by the way this is written in a book that was posthumously published after he died called pencies which is a word that means thoughts his thoughts he wanted this published after", "he died but he asked people this challenge or this to make this wager he said if you believe in God and God does exist will you gain everything eternal life but if you do not believe in God and God exists you have everything to lose in other words it doesn't make sense to not give your life to Christ why because you have nothing to lose and everything to gain but if you reject Christ you have everything to lose and absolutely nothing to gain my grandchildren went to Costco the other day and they let me know why they were excited about going because they said Friday is sample day must be genetic I used to go you remember those I don't know if it's everyday I don't know if they still it was a certain day maybe it's Friday back then but there was a certain day I think it was Sam's Club you would go down the aisles and you know you would notice there were certain things on display and you would act like oh what's that I'm here for other purposes of course but um oh uh oh sure I'll try one you know and then if it's really good it's like you disguise yourself for my wife yeah that was me okay there's something about that that makes sense with selling you know try me before you buy me kind of a thing with food obviously you're not just trying it you're consuming it but you know I think about that because the Bible does say taste and see that the Lord is good I used to have a bumper sticker on my car at 16 years old as a Christian that said give Jesus a chance and I think there are a lot of people who do everything else but the Lord they rule him out it's kind of like saying This Not That not that I have a friend in this church he's an alcoholic I would call him an ex-alcoholic but I know that it's his heart to help others who could relate to him he hasn't had a drink in over 40 years and he has repeatedly told me people who struggle with alcohol and drugs are going to until the day they wake up and look in the mirror and answer this one question are you done because until you say yes in your own will you're not done and I think about this when it comes to this issue of the Lord there are people who have pushed Jesus aside their whole lives and have gotten really good at it", "they're ex oh there's an altar call I already know I'm I'm not going forward see that's why the Bible says if you want to hear God Speak don't Harden your heart because if you harden your heart you're going to become hard of hearing as well and it gets easier and easier to say no in fact the gospel is the inoculation to the gospel maybe you grew up hearing the gospel you grew up hearing from your parents or at church or from your friends and you just got good at saying no so you already know the answer before it's even asked you're like me who when a Salesman you know you go into a store and that salesman comes up hey what are you looking for I'm looking for a store where there's no salesman actually to the curious Jesus said come and see remember Andrew and that other unnamed disciple of John the Baptist they're following Jesus at a distance and they're they're just curious who is he Behold the Lamb of God who takes away who we don't know him but John we respect him and he's advertising Jesus and she says you want to know are you willing then come and see to the curious and to the skeptical to the wandering on the day Jesus rose from the dead who showed up at the empty tomb not because they expected him to be alive but because somebody else said he the angel said why seek ye the living one among the dead but come and see in other words the Lord is waiting to reveal himself I believe to anyone and to everyone and to whosoever will he says come and see the Bible ends with an invitation in Revelation if you're thirsty come and drink take the water of life it's here are you done with the way you've been living are you willing to come you know um it used to be my sons when they were little they don't ask us anymore but my grandchildren still do as they start to see Christmas gifts going to the Christmas tree of course they're very interested if any of them have their name on it and then they want to know uh about now it's December when the gifts start to show up do we have to wait to open the gifts and I say no Christmas Eve is when we do it oh can can we open one sooner well they do they have to wait and sometimes we'll let them open one but they usually won't like that one because we'll pick out one not that one not yeah", "the underwear I mean we're not gonna give him the BB gun they'll shoot their eye out but can I tell you something that I know some of you already know you don't have to wait at all anymore you know the way till Christmas to open Christmas gift that is ever in fact I was thinking about this you know as uh some of you use Amazon some of you never do but uh we've started realizing it's so it can be good but I've noticed this about Christmas gifts and I've noticed that about packages on my porch they're until you open them it's like wow what is that I don't know thumbtacks that I ordered or something I forgot wasn't that all that exciting that I paid for it it's not like it's really a gift a lot of things are like that they look amazing until you open and it's usually a letdown this is the one gift in your life but you do not have a clue how valuable and precious and wonderful before you open it and the joy of what it is will only grow with every single day between now and I don't think it ends when we get to if you think we're gonna get there and go oh I know Jesus completely I've always wanted to this is amazing you don't understand a thing about Jesus and what he's already done for you but it has to have a beginning Naomi's story has to have a start job's Redemption has to have a place to begin thanks be to God for his unspeakable there's no words that can be used to describe the gift of who Jesus is what you need to do is receive it and that's why John last verse before I invite you to come John 1 12 and 13 says this but as many as received him received Christ to them he gave the right the authority the exousia to become children of God even to those who believe in his name who are born not of blood nor of the will of the flesh nor of the will of men I can't think of any better way look we can dress up the stage and put out trees and put out we can have all kinds of that there's something far more valuable than celebrating the history of Jesus coming 2 000 years ago and that is sharing that gift with as many people as possible and all I know is I don't know how many Christmases the rest of us in this room or myself have left on this planet what if Jesus were", "to come back this coming year or this year this was our last Christmas when we want yeah we'd celebrate that but then what about those who have not opened the gift yet wouldn't he want our passion to be that as many people as possible might meet our savior and go with us I believe so and so I believe with all my heart God help me to be more about sharing the gift that he's given me and to think there's hundreds of people in this room who've already opened the gift you already know what's in there and yes there are some people that are never going to walk in this room but he's sending you out you are the gift bearer of the gift that God wants to give but this morning I just want to ask if you're here and you've never given your life to Christ you've never been born again the Bible says will you receive him you say what do you asking me to receive I'm asking you to admit that you're a sinner and that you need a savior and Jesus is that savior that he came to fulfill all the promises of God but you must make a decision just like if I came to your door and I knocked them I said I have a gift for you he said oh Bob that's so nice thank you so much goodbye play I'm gonna shut the door and I'm standing outside with the gift what good is that it's a gift it was paid for it's yours but you must receive it and maybe you're here and you've always believed in it but you've never received him personally today is your day I want you to get out of your seats I'm going to pray a prayer we're going to sing a simple song of saying I want to give my life to you Lord you come forward come right down to the front and I'm going to pray a simple prayer I pray that over 50 years ago and every day of my life since well I shouldn't say everyday since but every day now I remember that day because my life started 51 years ago spiritually and your life can start today if you're willing would you bow your heads with me Believers pray for those that have yet to open the gift father by the power of the Holy Spirit Jesus you said you would knock on doors that I pray you would knock on the door of every heart that's here every person watching and listening to this message", "would you tell them that you love them would you show them that what you did two thousand years ago and being born as a baby wasn't just for the Jewish people or the religious people it was for people it was for lost people Lord would you find some here Among Us this morning and bring them to yourself For Your Glory for it's in Jesus name I pray amen if you want to receive Christ you say well Bob I'm not sure where I stand with Lord you've never publicly confessed him then confess him publicly come forward and pray a prayer that says Lord I confess you as my savior and my Lord I want to not just go through Christmas I want to be ready for it in fact I have people in my life that I want to share the gift with but I can't share it till I have it myself you come you come now come to the front let's sing and let's are you hurting and broken Within Jesus is Calling have you come to the end of yourself Father's Eyes Open Wide forgiveness was brought with of Jesus Christ I know sometimes people are brought up in church maybe even a church like ours and they know that the Bible talks about these things the value of Life the purpose of life the reality of death and they think about these things in one part of their life they have this compartment of religious thoughts and they don't deny them to be untrue but they've never personally actually done a deal with the Lord to confirm that they are going to put their faith in him and maybe you're here and you're kind of in between you have one foot in the world and you're one foot in the church or one foot in the kingdom of God and you look at yourself and you say I don't really know where I stand but I do know what I believe in my head and today it's time to go that one step farther to say I want to go on record before the Lord this is between you and him we just get to watch but I want to challenge you you say well Bob there's no one else going forward well what if you were the only one Jesus would be willing to die for you if you were the only one would you be willing to stand for him and be willing to stand alone I don't know if any will come forward but I can tell you this the net is being", "cast to invite anyone who is willing to admit I'm a sinner I need a savior Jesus Is My Savior and I want to do that transaction and I believe there's some of you that have never gone on record to God's spirit is ministering to your heart saying it's time for someone here maybe time to come back and make it clear where you want to go the rest of your life you don't know how long your life is going to be but you want it to account for eternity come forward say Lord forgive me wash me clean and use my life from this point on please don't wait this is your moment this is perhaps why God brought you here today you don't feel comfortable you wish I wasn't giving this message that's exactly why I'm giving this message because God loves you too much see you go to hell get out of your seats come forward if you want to come to Christ and I'll be honored to pray with you about that decision but come today there's no reason to wait Jesus is Calling You bring your sorrows From the Ashes in their life has gone Fed Up Jesus Christ with the pressures blood of Jesus Christ so there's a gift the tree it's not a Christmas tree but it is a tree and it has your name on it God has loved you with an everlasting love he didn't start loving you when you he didn't start loving you when your mom and dad met you when you were born or even when you were conceived he has been loving you for all time and waiting for you to come to an understanding that he loved you enough to send his son that gift is salvation it's right here but you need to come and receive it I'm going to pray with this gentleman and anybody else who wants to after this time of singing and please don't hold your breath and get through it if you feel like it's time to come for you you say well Bob if I came forward I I think people around me would wonder because they already think I'm saved and I wouldn't you know want to have people I thought you were already a Christian if you know you need to come you obey God you listen to the Lord God will use that in their life maybe there are some around you who aren't going to come until they see your decision maybe you're going to influence them don't come forward for them you come forward and maybe you have brought somebody", "today who's a neighbor or a friend or a relative and you've been coming to church here for a while or this is your first time you've never invited them to come forward but you're not sure where they stand you invite them say I'll stand with you if you'll go I'll go with you challenge them right now you ask them right now whatever they decide that's up to them don't push them out of their seat you invite them and trust God with the answer but we're gonna sing just one more time and if that's you and you know it come and let's decide before we go home we're ready to go home but you invite them to come forward let's the father's arms are open wide was bought with the precious blood of let's try the freshest God of Jesus of Jesus Christ the Bible says in John 4 Jesus must needs go through Samaria which historically and culturally we know was not true that he had to go there were ways to go around Samaria most Jews did it BC Jesus had an appointment at a well with one woman she was enough and you're enough and you guys here are enough for Christ to go out of his way today to make the service really about you and him so we are grateful for your decision would you guys be willing to pray this prayer simply after me pray it out loud I am a sinner and you are my savior today I want to make you my Lord please forgive me of my sin cleanse me to the Core and make me your child live inside of me and give me new life that I might live for the glory of God in Jesus name I pray got your family just got a lot bigger and we're excited that you guys are here today Merry Christmas early and by the way we want to share it just briefly with you as we close the service and song so if you'll turn to your right you're way over on the left they're they're putting their hands up there's a prayer they're going to take a minute give you a Bible just pray with you before we release you back we'll be getting done about the same time but let's thank the Lord for these two guys have to do let's let's sing let's all oh what I say isn't he wonderful Christ is risen bow down before him on Christmas Eve we will be sharing familiar Christmas hymns and songs choruses that people know and sharing the word of God and then giving an", "opportunity to receive Christ my challenge for you is not only to be here at one of those Services bring someone you know needs to make that decision and by the way pray that God would work in their hearts all we can do is be faithful our job is to you know people get worried about my old Pastor Bob only two people can I tell you something don't ever worry about that one sinner repents there's joy in heaven the Bible says there ought to be joyous and secondly I'm a father when my wife went in and had a baby I didn't go just one I went yes thank you Lord we should celebrate it I don't know who these guys belong to but if they come back out you thank God for what he's done today God bless you have a great week touch the sky but I don't feel better generations and your family and your children and the children and the I build my Fortress but as your voice you are here in the quiet places calling out my name longing just to bring me back home you are here in the chaos always running all this time I've never walked alone you are here in the quiet places and the colors nothing can separate even if I run away your love never fails for me every day all things work together you came and you lived now you're taking this higher we go from glory to we wish that day we're still leaving so not even death can't shake us the Victor has one and Heaven has come now you're taking us never ever change so I'll never be the same the Love's creations Hallelujah we magnify your name someone said it would be a lot easier to see a thousand hallelujahs if I could say sing them like Casey sings them because then everybody would enjoy them all the time so that's Casey who's singing that song and today today she's singing that song it's funny so many of you uh don't know the names of the people that are up here and so you always describe them to me and I always let you go on for far too long I know exactly who you're talking about so some of you'll be like who's the girl that that sings you know with the hair you know all right that's Casey and it's her birthday today so she's requested Guitar Center gift cards to be given to me I thought it was nice of her to do that Merry Christmas to me so", "but I kid you not so I said that first service and I went to the cafe and the person working in the cafe hadn't been in service and he goes hey you know that and I said yeah sings I said I think so and he said it's her birthday today what I wanted to say was you don't know her name but you know it's her birthday so he's like he bought her breakfast so that was very nice we'll honor her maybe a little later you can go up to her let her know how much she means to this body of Believers because uh she she's a blessing you know and you may be like yeah if I could only sing like that I would sing so much louder and I've heard a lot of people say that but here's what you're saying perhaps creation longs to have the words to sing but that Joy is mine you know we're very unique in creation that God breathed his breath into us and so we want to use that breath to pour out praise to him amen that's what we want to do and many of you I'm in a season right now uh where I feel like I'm holding my breath because I'm in anticipation of many things there's a lot of things that are influx in my life it's a good season to be in but sometimes you can enter a season like that and you just feel like you're holding your breath just waiting it out and I pray that I can get through this so that I can finally exhale at the end of that you ever felt that way it's it happens a lot but here's the thing in Isaiah 40 it says you will renew the strength of those who wait on the Lord another translation puts it your strength will be renewed as you trust in the Lord so many of us see waiting upon the Lord as waiting for the Lord to show up and remove us from our current predicament or situation and we can finally exhale but here's here's the truth of it is he is with us in every situation and so we can trust on the Lord as we're waiting for what's about to happen and maybe that thing that's coming is a joy that's about to happen maybe it's a new job or a new baby or a new season of life or maybe it's something that you don't want to happen and you're just holding your breath and you're just saying Lord help me through this here's the thing instead", "of holding your breath pour out your praise worship him in the waiting a trust on the Lord knowing that he is good and that as we just saying he works all things together for good amen and so we want to worship him this morning not just because it's worth it for us but because he is so worthy of it so we're going to sing a song that is a variation on scripture and it's a song or a chant or some some way we're going to be worshiping him with these words for all of eternity in heaven and so we get to start now because eternity Starts Now for those who believe in Christ amen so let's pray we're going to offer our time we're going to offer our talents whether or not you feel like you have the talent to sing or that Joy is yours if creation longs to have the breath to sing you have the breath use it to worship him and then also our treasures and so there's a link that'll pop up on the screen where we can facilitate giving through Calvary Chapel you're watching online it'll show up there and there's also boxes on the wall if you prefer to give a physical gift so let's pray let's honor the Lord ask him to be in our midst and help us to just exhale his phrases here this morning Lord thank you for who you are and what and help us to praise you first and foremost for who you are you're worthy of Praise but then celebrate what you've done you are God With Us you are God always with us and so so many reasons to praise you a thousand hallelujahs is not enough we thank you that we have eternity to try as we did so as we sing this song you would be that our circumstances would not take your praise here this morning or that we would trust on you that we can wait on the Lord and that you would renew our strength in Jesus name amen take a new song holy holy holy God oh the holy holy is this morning doing well glad to see you you're enjoying this here please open up your bulletins as we'll start our online we encourage you to get our e-books and if you haven't already you can simply get that by 16 59769 uh the word ccea and you'll get uh updates as well as this weekly bulletin we'll be going through and I want you to open up your bulletin because uh there bulletin and a lot of them I won't have", "time to cover today I'll be only highlighting four of them right here from the pulpit but there are many announcers in this bulletin that are worthy of your consideration and your gathering or a Ministry we want you just know where they are to see how we can best serve you here at Calvary Chapel East Anaheim but to get us started I want to Spotlight first of all our school of discipleship is starting up on January 8th it's an eight week uh semester of classes on Sunday afternoons the variety of topics being covered the all men to help you know him grow him and share and serve him better and um one of the classes I want to highlight today is the Evolution versus creation class by Richard Frizzell so would you he shares a little bit about his class yeah they actually gave me a mic imagine yeah my name is Richard I have a degree in geological sciences and it uh Evolution and creation is really important to me Evolution um took four and a half years of my walk away from me I believe that it explained everything and it is amazing to see how God and His Mercy towards me used science to draw me back to him I wasn't listening to the Bible and he used what I was studying to show me the fallacies of what evolution really is and so when I finally submitted Bethany and came back to the Lord I regretted what I had done walking away and a friend of mine pointed out and he goes no no no Richard those are the years that the locusts have eaten and I didn't understand that at first and so he pointed out in Joel chapter 2 25 that God prom made a promise saying that I will redeem to you the years that the locusts have eaten my class is God redeeming those years um the class represents the Opus of my life the Opus of what the Lord used to bring me back to him and if you don't know what that word is look it up it's a giving of that process of bringing back to the Lord my class represents all of the things that the Lord laid out in front of me and showed me that this is how it doesn't work in evolution and it does work in creation cite scriptures through my class but the main thing I wanted to tell you is is that we live in an era when evolution is running rampant in our society how many of you guys have kids grandkids great grandkids that are in", "elementary school junior high high school college how many of you guys have kids like that I'm speaking to you because you need to be able to answer and what my class I hope hopefully will do is give you the evidence that you need to refute what they're being taught we have a responsibility to the Next Generation to show them the truth that is God's word and the fallacy that the world will want us to believe so if you're interested in it come see me in the bookstore I'm more than happy to answer any questions for you but I would love to see each one of you in my class thank you Richard give you away is our Christmas services so on Christmas Eve we have two services for you the two o'clock service and the four

the cafe as usual today I'd like you to open your Bibles I know if you come Sunday mornings they follow up in the second Peter usually but they need to open to Genesis so open your Bible to Genesis and I am going to read one verse from Genesis 2. you can stand for a moment if you want for that it's going to be over before some of you stand that's okay Genesis 2 beginning in verse 7. then the Lord God formed man of the dust from the ground and he breathed into his nostrils the Breath of and Man became a living being father as we draw now into the season that even the world around us begins to give at Christmas though does not understand the depths of it Lord how I pray that everyone here would be looking at and thinking about Christmas from the perspective of your word and we pray Lord that you'd prepare us for celebrating with our family with your family but Lord we ask that many people this year would open that gift and we pray even here now in this service people watching people who have come now might discover all that you have for them in sending Jesus so Lord bless this service and use it for your glory it's in Jesus name we pray in all God's people said amen would you have a seat", "so I do like uh at Christmas time just as I like to at Easter to pull back from my regular studies and um we will spend some time over the next two or three weeks looking into the Old Testament you know Christmas most of the time we think well that's told in in the New Testament and it's true for sure uh it's covered in Matthew Mark and Luke in particular the story of what we think of the Nativity but Christmas if you're going to understand it you really need to go further back and you can't go much farther back than Genesis you know Genesis the word Genesis means the beginning you know that ganacho is the Greek word and the first few books of the Bible have Greek names not Hebrew and so this is the book of beginnings and it's the right place for us to go to look at the beginning of everything and while I've called this the Genesis of Christmas because we're going to be in Genesis looking at several different accounts of some births if you will my original title was the seeds of Christmas because I'm going to talk about the seed of man the Seed of Abraham and the seed of Israel from The Book of Genesis and how they relate to Christmas now the first fill in if you're going to take notes and I hope you are is to put in the word sin and Satan and here when I say he I'm talking about Christ he is the seed of redemption from sin and Satan when I say the Christ is first of all to be understood as the seed of man to save man he had to be a man that's part of the principle of the Incarnation to save us God could not save us except that he paid the price which meant the shedding of blood and he had to live this life that you and I have lived now when we talk about man in the Bible we tend to think of the masculine because that's the way we use the word man but that's not the way the Bible does in the beginning God created Man In His Image what does it say then male and female by the way that's all God gives I know Facebook gives you a whole lot more choices there just just now I remember doing a video of a little uh little kids for a church uh Gathering to ask them questions to describe different things and we were I asked uh um you know describe heaven for us and", "what does God look like and we would ask these children and they had all kinds of ideas that we were talking about church services and this little girl I was probably five years old I said uh and what is a hymn she looked at me and she goes a boy about a hymn but anyway but I you know there's a wisdom that God gives to five-year-old children that seems to be withheld from a woke world but uh in the scriptures the genders are twofold and so when I say the seed of man we're going to talk about the seed of man Adam and also the seed of woman in terms of understanding the beginning of Christmas the foreshadowings of the coming of a savior so put this down number one first of all he Christ is born to make a new life available for anyone and in our text we see the God made man and he became a living soul but in that same chapter just a few verses later God points out the trees for which he provided food and then in verse 17 says but from the Tree of the knowledge of Good and Evil you shall not eat of it for in the day that you eat of it you will surely die and we all know that's exactly what happened but when Adam and Eve disobeyed God they didn't just bring death to themselves but they actually brought death to every child that would ever be born of them including everyone in this room death became a part of our experience and not just death but actually destruction and Decay I believe the second law of Thermodynamics came into play that of entropy the expansion of uh uh the spending of energy that the nature of our entire universe you see death isn't just something that happened to a man and a woman and to all their children but death began to the entire creation that's found in Romans 8 that it was subjected to futility the Bible says and all of creation is looking for the day to be set free from that bondage which is going to happen when Christ returns to this Earth but the Bible tells us in the Book of Matthew we're given the lineage of the Messiah now remember Matthew was Jewish writing to a Jewish audience and he is writing in particular his gospel to tell his audience that Jesus is the Messiah the long-awaited long promised one hamashiach that God had promised from the beginning to their forefathers and so when Matthew in chapter 1 writes about the what we call", "the genealogy of Jesus he actually is very specific of taking it if you go read it from Abraham onward it starts with Abraham because the Messiah comes from Abraham and also then he mentions David because Messiah has to be the son of David to be the king of Israel that's the purpose is to show that he has the right to the throne of Israel when you get to the Gospel of Luke there's this one's a little different in chapter three Luke by the way is not a Jew remember he was the companion of Paul he was the physician he's Greek he's not writing to a Jewish audience he's already read Matthew by the time he writes his gospel and basically saying everything Matthew said for the Jews is true but wait there's more kind of like the Ginsu knife commercial wait there's more Jesus doesn't just Trace back to David and to Abraham but he takes the genealogy of Jesus all the way back to to Adam and actually to God jot it down it's found in Luke 3 and verse 38 as he gets to the end of his genealogy of Jesus the son of enosh the son of Seth who is the son of Adam who was the son God you see Luke is in his gospel going to emphasize some things that neither Matthew Mark or John do in fact do you know there's 10 chapters in The Gospel of Luke that give us information that none of the other gospels give it has to do with Jesus's travels From Galilee to Jerusalem to be crucified whereas in the other gospels that's just kind of summarized Luke goes into great detail about where Jesus went what he taught for instance it's in those 10 chapters that Luke who wants to emphasize that Jesus is not just the savior of the Jews but the Savior for the whole world will tell The Parables of the lost sheep the Lost coin and the lost son the prodigal son because the emphasis in Luke is that Jesus came not just to save his own but to save anyone and whoever will believe in him it's in Luke 24 the Final Chapter that Jesus gives the command that the gospel of forgiveness of sins must go out to all the nations not just to the Jewish people it starts with them but it doesn't end with them it's Luke Who records the salvation of the worst of the worst Zacchaeus yeah he was a Jewish but he was a chief tax collector and the most hated within that culture and that", "record of his coming to faith in Christ is when Jesus says these words the son of man came to seek and save that which was lost and that's the whole point he's in the business of saving the loss of any culture of any generation no matter where you've come from as a person until you come to Christ you are lost you know every church has a lost and found right behind this wall is our lost and found if you left your Bible here one Sunday it's probably in there if you see somebody else grabbed it Finders Keepers I guess but we try to gather everybody's stuff and put them in these cabinets every church has their lost and found that's where our physical lost and found is but every Sunday every Wednesday it's it's right in this room the question is which are you are you somebody who's you've never actually received Christ you've never discovered the life that he intends for you to live can I just tell you right at the beginning of my message day at the end and I know a lot of you most of you maybe are believers you've come to faith in Christ but I want to speak to those of you who have not and I want to challenge those of you who have never received Christ never publicly profess Christ remember Jesus said if you'll confess me before men I'll confess you before my father who's in heaven you didn't do that you've never done that maybe you believe intellectually but you've never given your life to the Lord I'm going to challenge you to get out of your seats come forward and make a profession of Faith asking Christ to come into your life and maybe that's the reason God wanted you here at this service maybe your first time here maybe you've been coming as long as anybody but you've never given your life to Christ or you're just not sure where you stand with the Lord be ready at the end of the service decide now when that invitation is given you're going to come maybe some of you've been struggling with things and you thought it was about those things and God's sake it's actually not about any of those things it's about this decision and until you make this decision those other things are not going to be clear to you so I want you to be ready for that to receive Christ today but Christ is the seed of man and then being that he is the seed of redemption from sin and Satan put this", "down if you're taking notes he is born to make a new life available as I said for anyone you know um I think sometimes we think that Jesus well he's good for those people that are into that he's he's for those religious folks he's for my parents or my grandparents or my religious friends no he was born for you I like the phrase in Hark the Herald Angels Sing that says mild he lays his glory by but he was born that man no more may die Born to Raise the sons of earth born to give us second birth and so we see this analogy in the scriptures made from Adam to Christ jot it down Romans 5 and verse 18. listen to what Paul says to the church at Rome Romans 5 18 so then as through one transgression it's here talking about the sin of Adam through one transgression there resulted condemnation to all men through one act of righteousness this is Christ going to the Cross there resulted justification of life to all men in other words this analogy is that Adam made a decision that has affected you and every other person has been born humanly every one of us is born with a sin nature every one of us is born separated from God the Bible says we were dead in our sins before we came to Christ if you've never come to Christ that's what the Bible describes you you might feel like I don't feel dead you know what dead people don't feel nothing so don't be surprised you don't feel far now there's an old bumper sticker that says if you don't feel close to God guess who moved I like it except the fact is that's true for believers for unbelievers it's the wrong bumper sticker for the unbelievery world if you don't feel close to God guess who Moved nobody because that's where things start and they'll stay there they'll end there except something changes but Paul says there is a relationship between what Adam and Christ did Adam came the first man in his decision of Disobedience has affected all of us but Christ's decision of obedience can affect and does affect all who are in Christ jot down first Corinthians 15 and verse 45 so also Paul says it is written the first man Adam became a living Soul we just read that that's Genesis 2 7. the last Adam this is what it describes Christ it's one of his titles he's the last Adam he became a life-giving spirit you see when man was made he had freedom", "deed of any tree except one there was only one rule he could break and he decided I'm gonna break it because this is you sometimes people go yeah when I get to heaven I'm going to say what's with you Adam if it wasn't for you you know I mean what's that I'm gonna say for his excuse you know happy wife happy life I don't think so I mean he blamed Eve originally but I don't think he'll be doing that in hopefully you've outgrown that by then but if you think oh if I was there I would have done differently you're completely wrong you'd have sinned so would I he was our champion he had no sin nature the fact is we would have fallen as well but there was a test there had to be a test to see if in fact his trust was going to be in God and as a result it wasn't you know it's been said that Adam was given a test in the garden and he well he bombed out he was the first Adam Bomb but the last Adam that is Christ also is tested not just out in the wilderness in those three areas that Eve was tempted and tested in the lust of the flesh the lust of the eyes and the pride of life John says those are the three areas of Temptation Jesus received three Temptations Eve was tempted and all three gave in to them Jesus resisted all of them he was tempted at all points as we are yet without sin but he also was tested in a garden remember at the end of his ministry but Jesus said nevertheless not my will be done but yours he went to the Cross he accepted that place in our life to give us forgiveness for our sins Billy Graham when he would give his altar calls many times and call people to admit their Sinners he would say this nobody can go back and make a new start but anybody can start now to make a new I agree with that sometimes I'll talk to people and they'll share something they've done they've blown it they've really failed or they'll admit to something from their past and what I always say to them I have to say to myself which is this you can't go back and redo we don't get a do-over of being a dad or a husband we don't get to do it again the best you can do is be honest about what you've done in other words you can't go back and do it right but you", "can do right now about the wrong you've done go ask for forgiveness get it right with the Lord decide now you're going to and coming to Christ is like that it's saying Lord I've messed up I screwed up my childhood maybe or I made bad decisions in my first marriage or the current one that I'm in or in the relationships that I have God I haven't honored you I'm not going to pretend I'm all that because I'm not all that but Jesus is and he lived the life I have been and he took my place and now I want to accept him I want to receive him as my Lord and my savior put this down number two he's the seed of the woman he is the seed of man but he is called the seed of the woman it's one of his titles who brings freedom jot down Genesis 3 and verse 15 if you're in your Bible you can look at the verse from your text here on the curse of Satan after the curse of the serpent God says these words I will put enmity between you The Serpent and the woman and between your seed and her seed then it says this of her seed he shall bruise you on the head and you shall him on the heel that Hebrew word Bruce can also be he will crush your head by the way Genesis 3 15 is sometimes referred to by theologians as what's called The proto-uon Galleon Proto means first in Greek yuan galeon is the word for gospel or good news it is the first mention of the Gospel in the Bible and it's this promise that is picked up on by Paul the Apostle in Galatians jotted down Galatians 4 verses 4 and 5. Paul said this but when the fullness of the time had come God sent forth his son born of a woman he's the seed of a woman born under the law in order that he might redeem those who are under the law now when we talk about people who are under the law the tendency is think well that's the Jews that's true in many contexts but in this context it's actually universally true we're all under the law you say how so jotted down Romans 3 and verse 19. Paul says now we know that whatever the law says it speaks to those who are under the law that every mouth may be closed and all the world may be accountable to God if you've been with us or study in the Book of Romans or for", "that matter in the Old Testament you know that we've said the law is not given to make man holy the law was given by God to make man speechless you say what do you mean the Bible says God gave the law so that every mouth will be closed when God judges because the law reveals our sin it evidences that we need the Bible says at the cross if you will the serpent Satan bruised Christ's heel but Christ crushed the head of the serpent praise God so we are redeemed from sin and from Satan and put this down see that his victory has now become yours if you're in Christ put in the word yours and jot down Romans 16 and verse 20. you see Christ's crushing the head of the serpent we think that's what happened at the cross and the resurrection he has he was Victorious that's true but the question is is that now something you own and something that you have received Romans 16 20 Paul says this the God of Peace will soon Crush Satan under your feet he absolutely personally applies what the Bible says Christ did on the cross to those Christians there in Rome here's the thing we need to remember it's true Jesus died a horrible death but never forget this what death did to Jesus is nothing compared to what Jesus did to that's really important to understand you see Christ died on the cross the Bible says to save us from three things first the penalty of sin what's that it's Eternal damnation he all that's what Romans 8 1 says if you're in Christ there's no condemnation you see he also died on the cross though to save us from the power of sins habitual domination in our life now he died to save me from hell so I go to heaven but he died to save me from the power of sin in my life right now so the man who came up and said pastor after first I need help in my marriage because I'm struggling with this and the other yes we believe Romans 6 a sin will not be Master over you I still sin I'm not sinless but as a Christian I should sin less because the power of the holy spirit gives you now the ability to say no to what before you were a slave to so Christ died on the cross both to save us from the penalty of sin and the power of sin but too often forgotten Christ also died on the cross to save us from", "what I'll call the product of sin what's that according to the Bible it's a continual vexation of the fear you say what do you mean well Jive it down Hebrews 2 verses 14 and 15 says it since then the children that's me and you share in flesh and blood Christ likewise also partook of the same that's the Incarnation that through death he might render powerless him who had the power of death that is the devil and might deliver those who through fear of death were subject to slavery all their lives that's a description of mankind that's a universal thing of all cultures that they fear death that death is coming and they they're not ready for it and unfortunately sometimes even as Christians people who haven't really owned all that God has done for them look I'm I'm no uh I'm not against exercise but somebody wrote this according to a recent study on physical exercise for every hour you do cycling you gain one extra hour of life he said but think about it the hour you gain is the hour you wasted being hot sweaty and out of breath one way of looking at it and then for the five of you that never heard me share this story this 90 year old couple having been married almost 65 years had died in a car crash they had been in good health the last 10 years mainly due to the wife's interest in health food and exercise when they reach the Pearly Gates Peter took them to their mansion which was decked out with a beautiful kitchen a master bath suite and a Jacuzzi this is a true story as they oohed and awed the old man asked Peter how much is all this going to cost it's free Peter replied this this is heaven next they went out back to survey the championship golf course that the home backed up to they would have golfing privileges every day and every week the course changed to a new one representing the great golf courses on Earth the old man asked well what are the green fees Peter said this is heaven you play for free next they went to the clubhouse and they saw the lavish buffet lunch with the Cuisines of the world laid out how much is it going to cost to eat ask the old man don't you understand it this is heaven it's free Peter replied with well well then where are the low fat and the low cholesterol tables the old man asked timidly Peter election that's the best part", "you can eat as much as you would like of whatever you like and you never get fat and you never get sick this is heaven without the old man went into a fit of throwing down his hat stomping on it and shrieking wildly Peter and his wife the man's wife both tried to calm him down asking him what was wrong the old man looked at his wife and said this is all your fault if it weren't for your blasted bran muffins I could have been here 10 years ago isn't it wonderful to think that the worst thing that most people can imagine is what's going to send you to heaven you ever thought about that to see your savior face to face to never again have to weep to never again have a disease or see someone die of a disease or a tragedy that does those days will be behind you to to realize that everything that you've longed for was true and better than you even could possibly imagine it no more tears no no more pain you see when a Spirit-filled believer they shouldn't worry they should worship said of Heaven it is far better that's how he described it in other words I if I have to stay I'm willing to because there's a purpose but I can't wait to be Pastor Mike Swanson gave a great message called Heaven is better before he went there if you haven't seen it you should Google it over a hundred thousand people have it's excellent Paul said for me to live is Christ to kerdas in the Greek cardos is the is the plus column of a ledger of an accountant for me to live is Christ to die is pure gain we shouldn't be those afraid of death as Believers if there's anybody on the planet who has the right to not be afraid of death it's you remember when John Falls as a dead man in Revelation 1 before Jesus who's glorified he says he fell as a dead man unlike those soldiers were when Christ rose from the dead just catatonic in in the glory before the glory of God and remember what Jesus said he said fear for I am the first and the last and I have the keys of death and Hades isn't that awesome I have the keys of death in other words I own it see there's a lot of Christians who said I've given him my sins and my past failings and I accept my forgiveness or I put him on the throne of my life I know he's ruling", "right now and I accept Romans 8 28 he's working all things together for good when are you going to put him in charge of your death when are you going to stop being afraid of what's coming and is actually a gift because there's some in this room and you don't own that yet but it's what he wants to give you put this down he is the seed from whom all flow he is the seed of man he is the seed of the woman but he's also the Seed of Abraham jotted down Genesis 22 18. God said this stay Abraham in your seed all the nations of the Earth shall be blessed remember the promise came to Abraham who whose wife was Barren they're both elderly and his concern was Lord I'm not going to even have an heir to give the blessings that you've given me the the servant in my home is going to be the one who went I don't even have a name to pass on remember God says really go outside here look up at the stars Abraham can you count the Stars he said no he said your seed will be like the stars of and the Bible says Abraham believed God I don't know how that's going to happen but I believe God reckoned it unto him his righteousness that's why Abraham is the father of all who believe not just to have descended to him and you're Jewish oh no it's about being a child of Faith who believes God's promise that comes through the Messiah but this promise Genesis 22 18 there are those who say well that's talking about the Jewish nation in your seed the Jewish people all the families of the earth will be blessed and so well the Jews gave us the word of God and the Jews gave us the temple and monotheism the Jews gave us the Messiah oh no listen remember this the best commentary on the is the Bible if you don't understand the passage keep reading and so much of the Bible will come to be understood the seed talked about to Abraham in your seat all the families or nations of the earth will be blessed is not talking about his physical descendants how do I know that because I read the Bible Galatians 3 16. listen to what Paul the Apostle says under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit about that promise now the promise the promise is we're spoken to Abraham and to his seed he does not say and to seeds as referring to many but rather to one and to your seed", "that is Christ what God was saying to Abraham although he did bring him many children and a huge Nation would come from him that was actually a Messianic promise in your seed the Messiah will all nations not just Jews but everybody who is willing to come to him they will be blessed put this down see yourself as God's beloved receiver jot down Ephesians 1 and verse 3. blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ who has already blessed us with every spiritual blessing in the Heavenly places in Christ you know I grew up in another generation than some of you some of you are from my generation but as I think about it gets a little bit crazy I am actually my childhood and and early years of growing up were another century actually it was another millennium it's kind of weird makes me feel really old when I say that but as I would watch late night TV there was this one commercial that was it was a car salesman selling used cars and uh if you want to yeah you remember the song even maybe go see cow go see cow go see cow right it's Cal Worthington at his dog spot which was all kinds of different animals and I'll step on him and I'll eat a bug and some people going what are you talking about the others are laughing on there my age on that show he would actually have cars specific particular cars that he was trying to sell you and so they would bring them out on the they'd have the how much it costs on the windshield and then he would talk about the car now unlike many new cars today where basically there is one model it has all the items already you you could take it or leave it because you don't get choices back then it wasn't that way there was the stock model car which usually had you know no electric it had power steering you needed to use all your power to steer it and power brain okay and if you wanted to buy one with other things in it you know air conditioning and you know various things they just didn't come standard and so I remember he would always put these used cars out but he would always this is a fully loaded model like just so you know it's got everything and I always think of that you're saying what does this have to do with the Bible you'll see Psalm 68 and verse 19. I always think of Psalm 68 19", "when I think of Cal blessed be the Lord who daily loadeth us with benefits even the god of our Salvation in other words in Christ you have everything that God has to give and he's dead what did what did David say my cup overflows it's not just that I have it you know spiritually in Christ but he is pouring them into my life and now it's overflowing and now people should enjoy being around me isn't that exactly what Laban said to Jacob I discern that I'm being blessed I'm encounter you ah it's not me but I like to be having you work for me because I get blessings that are rolled over blessings and that's exactly what Joseph heard from the warden in the prison that he served at I sense God's blessing me because of you I pray your neighbors say that I pray your boss says that I pray your unsaved family members I sense the love of God the grace of God in your life I'm just getting the Overflow and then you say wouldn't you like more wouldn't you like to be the target of those blessings I had a friend whose dad was a Christian and whenever I was over at their house if his if his dad sneezed and I said God bless you he would always answer the same he does I remember the time getting a little annoyed like can you come up with something new but anyway that's all he always said he does I think every Christian should answer he has he does and I know he will again I know some men who I say how you doing better than I deserve they answer and I say Amen to that if you've known the grace of God if you've been the recipients of the blessings of God like Jacob said when he crossed the Jordan River I'm not worthy of the least of his mercies and as I look at all that he's done for me I am blown away but he has decided to make me some of the evidence that billboard that's what Psalm 23 is it's just a big advertisement for the shepherd the Lord is my shepherd let me tell you about him because of the way he is I don't have any needs he prepares a table he guides it's all about the blessings that I have being something that glorifies my shepherd put this down he's the seed who redeems our greatest sorrows we've looked briefly at how Christ is the seed of man to redeem man he's the seed of the woman who redeems he's also", "the Seed of Abraham that brings every blessing to anybody who's willing to receive him but he's also the seed of Israel put in the word sorrows and jot down Genesis 35 verses 16 through 19. then they now this is the traveling of Jacob but Jacob was his old name Jacob is who now he got his name actually changed in chapter 32. remember when he fought with actually crippled by the Lord and then clung to that angel and he got a brand new name you have been Yakov one who's one who supplants a rip-off basically but now in your defeat and in your clinging to the Lord your new name is Israel governed by God a prince with God and now Israel is traveling home from after 20 years of being with Laban now married not to one wife but to two you remember he had the Groupon got he married Rachel who he had worked seven years for he was in love with her um but they threw in Leah on the wedding night and he discovered in the morning ah it's not the woman I you know sometimes people marry someone go then I realize it's not the person I thought they were that was really true for Jacob yeah I was not the woman I thought you was you know but uh he winds up getting both and of course the reason there are 12 tribes of Israel is there are 12 sons of Israel of Jacob and they come from two wives and two concubines and they came as a result of what I call the baby Wars as they are competing with each other trying to out produce each other having children but his favorite beloved only Bears him too and this is the account of the second the birth of Benjamin but here's what it says then they that is Jacob and Rachel or Israel and Rachel and his family are journeying from Bethel remember Bethel is where Jacob's Ladder happens it's where he meets the Lord for the first time and when there was still some distance to go to ephrath Rachel began to give birth she's nine months pregnant and she suffers severe labor and it comes about when she was in severe labor the Midwife who's helping her says don't be afraid for now you have another son the baby is born and she sees it's a boy and she Comforts her and says you have another son and it came about as her soul was departing Rachel dies giving that before she dies she names him butter his father Israel calls him", "Benjamin now benoni literally translated as son of my sorrows because Rachel in giving birth to the son is not really comforted that he's born because she won't get to live to see him grow up at all as she realizes so put this down he is Born the son of the son of my sorrows jot down Isaiah 53 verses 3 and 4. verse 3 and 4 this prophecy from about the 8th Century BC of Messiah he was although he will be yet in terms of it was in the future he was despised and forsaken of man A Man of Sorrows and acquainted with grief and like one from whom men hide their face he was despised and we did not esteem him surely our griefs he himself bore and our sorrows he carried yet we ourselves esteemed him stricken smitten so Jesus is called as one of his titles in Prophecy in fact the son of my sorrows The Man of Sorrows and we see that in his life that he lived in everything that happened to him he went through this life rejected so that he could relate to us who have the consequences of sin in our life he wasn't believed in by his own family some of you have become Christians and your family has turned against you some of you have lost a lot of things because you came to Christ you say it's worth it but it's cost you Jesus understands maybe some of you have actually been betrayed by a close friend Jesus understands what that's like he was tempted at all points as we are yet without sin but he became a man that he might become according to Hebrews a sympathetic high priest he can relate to us he learned obedience through the things that he suffered it's because he went through this life and suffered that he now can relate to us who suffered but he's a man of Sorrows and that's why the Bible says cast your cares upon Him he's ready not just to carry your your Sorrows to the Cross he's ready to carry them right now today the Bible says that the sacrifices of God are broken in a contrite heart the Bible says God is nigh or near to The Afflicted it's not just that he died for you in general he is here to carry your Sorrows today if you'll let him do that born son of my sorrows but put this down his father calls him the son of my right hand you say what do you mean Benjamin is just that Ben is son of Yamin is the", "he is called by the father though he was son of my sorrows he becomes the son of my right hand jot down Isaiah 53 verses 10 and 11. Isaiah 53 after talking about Jesus will be the son of my sorrows or a man of sorrow says but the Lord was pleased to crush him putting him to grief if he he will see his offspring he'll prolong his days and the good pleasure of the Lord will prosper in his hand as a result of the anguish of his soul he will see it and be satisfied by his knowledge or by knowledge of him the righteous one my servant will justify the many and he will bear their iniquities if I paraphrase it he's saying he'll realize it's all worth it all the suffering all the sorrow for the joy set before him which is you going to heaven he endured the cross he was willing to experience those sorrows because he knew what it would produce so we see in the Book of Genesis the beginning of Christmas as the seed of the man the seed of the woman the promise of the Savior was given way back in Genesis as the promise of the Seed of Abraham that would be a blessing for the whole world that's Jesus being born the Angels told those Shepherds that the Messiah had been born peace on Earth Good Will to men with whom he is pleased God is doing something because he loves you but because of your sin he has to come and he has to suffer in your place but it's to be a gift of eternal life and then we discover he is the one who redeems our greatest Sorrows so my question is this do you know this because you studied it in the Bible do you know this because you came to church today do you know this because you've always believed this your whole life to be what scripture teaches in Christianity teaches or do you know this you see I believe that Christmas is God's greatest gift being given but like any gift somebody could buy a gift for personally for you wrap it up put your name on it come to your house knock on your door have you come to the door and you can say I have a gift for you a Christmas gift you say oh that's so nice of you thank you but if you shut the door and walk away saying that was so nice of them and you never receive it what good is it to you I believe there", "are many people in this world maybe even in this room you've never personally actually received the gift of Christ and that's where it begins until that moment happens your life actually is waiting to start you'll find in the Bible many times people's story of redemption is told but what comes before that isn't even mentioned much for instance the Book of Ruth is a Redemption story did you know that it's about the story of our Redemption of a woman named Naomi Naomi is married to a man and has two sons but as a result of some decisions they make and God allows the the husband dies the two sons die and that's actually where the Story begins and she has nothing she has no family she's in pain and suffering and sorrow and guess what her story is just beginning it's the rest of the book that tells what God is going to do to break both Ruth and Naomi into the family the future family of David and the future family of the Messiah you'll find those ladies names written in those genealogies God had a whole plan that started with ashes and maybe that's what you have so far to offer God you read the book of job that's a long book it's hard to read through it for some people job was wealthy had a great reputation lots of people that loved him had lived a long life his children have grown up but guess what we don't hear about any it's when he loses it all when it's all gone we don't know much about that all we know is his story just and maybe you're here and you've lived a long life or a short life but you feel like my life has been hard what if your Redemption is just ready to begin today and you're going to look back on the decision you make to receive Christ you don't even know it yet all that God wants to give you in giving you his son put this down except Pascal's wager you see I don't know who Pascal is well I'm about to tell you some of you know Blaise Pascal was a and Christian Theologian in the 17th Century by the way Pascal is the one who is quoted as saying that God created a god-shaped void in every man that only Jesus Christ can fit there's something of a need in every man they know it they sense it they're looking for in all kinds of ways only Christ will ever complete it that's something Pascal once said but he made", "this by the way he wrote these these words in a work that was actually published after he died it was called pences which means thoughts and it was until he died that posthumously this was uh actually produced for people to read but he challenged people with this wager where he said if you believe in God and God does it and God does exist well you gain everything you have nothing to lose in everything to gain but if you do not believe in God and God exists will you have everything to lose in other words he argues from reason he says it makes sense to make the decision if you're not sure I love what the Bible says in Isaiah 1 18 come let us reason together saith the Lord my uh my grandkids just recently went to uh Costco it was a Friday I said oh what do you go on there for they said because it's sample day and I thought to myself I remember those I don't remember my day was Sam's Club or Costco but I remember there was a certain day do you guys remember you know this that's the day you go there you pretend to be shopping what do you got cooking over there I'm here I'm here to buy but oh really yo you want me to try oh wow sure I'll try one oh man that's good it's so good honey I'm gonna disguise myself and go back and let's go you know walk around the store and do dinner at the same time I like that try before you buy let's face it that's a good thing that's why I like trials on anything you know you can cancel and I always do but here's what the scripture says taste and see that the Lord is good when I was 16 I had a bumper stick my first bumper sticker on my car I was a Christian it said give Jesus a chance it's funny how many people have ruled Jesus out given everything else a chance or one of our guys shares the gospel in and there was a guy that was in there for years a sentence for his crimes and why don't you give Jesus a chance you've you've tried everything else in your life and look where it's gotten you and it was those words that caused that man to realize I never have I've decided who Jesus was and gave up on him long time ago and he gave his life to Christ you know to the curious two guys who didn't know Jesus but were", "following him because of the testimony of John the Baptist one was Andrew they're following Jesus and Jesus at the beginning of his ministry in John 1 turns on says what do you need what do you want what are you looking for uh I always pretend like I think they don't really know what to say I don't think they expect him to say that it's like wow we didn't study for that question what do we want I don't know we're just funny because John told us but they said uh where where do you uh where do you live where are you staying and Jesus said come and see and I believe the Lord gives that kind of an invitation you don't really know me you don't really know what it'll mean to follow me you're not ready maybe quite to say that you're this big believer in me but I challenge you to come and see and that's where Andrew met Jesus and it was a day later he was introducing Jesus to his brother the day Jesus rose from the dead Jesus's faith-filled apostles did not believe he was alive if it were not for the women who came and said he's gone he's alive and you know they ran down there and then the angel confronts them um what are you guys doing here why are you in a cemetery why do you seek the living one among the dead don't you remember what he told you a little bit of a reproof but come see the place where he was come check it out he's not here he has risen just as he said I think for some in this room you've gone as far as you can go in your belief in Jesus academically mentally maybe historically family you come to church you go to church because you do believe in him maybe there's some of you that aren't even sure you're not sure if you'll ever be sure if anybody can be other certain people that believe in others of us that just well we're not quite ready are you willing to allow him to demonstrate to you that he's real are you willing to come to him on his terms and say basically Lord if you're real I need to worship you listen you only have the rest of your life however long or short that is to live for him and some of you in this room you have not lived for him before now to the degree you know you should if he is God he is your savior he deserves everything that you", "have to give I don't stop talking about your money I'm talking about your passions I'm talking about your time I believe the longer we're alive the more we want to see our lives worthwhile because it's going to be over and by the way the decisions you make in this life some of us maybe haven't even discovered that yet that there is eternity we're not living our lives in light of Eternity we're living our lives in terms of retirement or in terms of finances or in terms of family but we're not living our lives in light of Eternity and the Lord wants us to you know I have three sons who used to ask the same question that now my four grandchildren do when they come over to my house and they'll ask it this Thursday night when they come over because they'll see the and they'll see the gifts that are to go under the tree and they'll want to know whose name is on that one and that big one over there is that sometimes we don't put the labels on just so they can't figure it out you and they'll say oh do we have to wait until they'll always ask do we have to wait till Christmas Day to open up these gifts no I say Christmas Eve and I occasionally will let them open one which we can open one yep now Becky and I will always choose which one though no no not that one give me the underwear give him the PJs we don't want Christmas to be attacked back together give them that but but the fact is you know this is just true I've noticed that not long ago Becky I thought I was the only one you know but because it used to be if there was a package it was mine you know not anymore uh she is way out done me and uh she it's true you get stuff faster and cheaper many times anyway so there's packages all that don't you know I probably shouldn't advertise that but um actually come take it but um but I I it's a funny thing I've noticed about Parcels that come in the mail and and for that matter gifts that are all wrapped up they're very exciting before they're unwrapped it's like what is that I don't know you know something good you know some you know and you always like oh that's the paper weight I bought you know it's just boring stuff in there and they're almost all gifts not all but almost are kind of a letdown compared to", "when you didn't know except this one except this one Paul calls Jesus an because this is the gift that when you receive and you open it it is way more than you thought it ever and it continues to get better and better and better and better and listen not just in this life but for all eternity if you thought we're going to get to heaven and go oh now I know everything there is about Jesus this is great thanks for letting me go you don't for all eternity we are going to be discovering his riches and the beauty of who he is but listen that has to start somewhere that has to begin somewhere and that means you decide you're going to receive it and so in a moment our going to challenge you to fit into John 1 12 and 13. these are two of my favorite verses to talk to people about their relationship to the Lord because here's what it says he Jesus came to his own the Jews his own received him not but to as many of them or anybody else for that matter who did receive him he gave the authority to become children of even to those who believe on his name who are born not of the will of man or the will of the flesh but of God listen if you cannot say you've received Christ then why not what are you waiting for you don't have to wait for Christmas Day or Christmas Eve yes I will share a gospel message on Christmas Eve don't wait for that today's your day today Christ is knocking on doors there are some of you here and maybe you've been a Christian your whole life and everybody calls yourself a Christian but inside your heart there's some part of you that or maybe you feel like you're not sure if the Lord were to come back or you were to die you'd be in heaven there's some question mark over your salvation in your own mind there's an what if God brought you here today whether it's your first time your 50th for this one reason that you could settle this business today you want Christmas to be a great Christmas it can start today let's pray father by your Holy Spirit would you examine Hearts your word says your spirit searches the Deep things of God and I thank you that you search the hearts and the Reigns of man the depths of who we are Lord you know who are and you know who has opened the gift and is celebrating the greatest gift in", "Christ and you know those who've never yet started I pray would you invite them would you bring them because unless you do it all the words in the world won't the Lord love them thank you that you already proved you did and you still do and that you're here so I pray you would draw men and women to yourself this For Your Glory in Jesus name I pray amen we're about to sing a simple song of response if you've a desire to come to Christ come right up here to the front and I'm going to pray with you when we're done singing you've never come to the Lord but you want to you're not sure if you're saved but you want to be you want to come and see Jesus is who he said he is come right to the front and admit that he's a savior and you're a sinner and then we'll pray but let's sing together you come are you hurting Within overwhelmed by the weight of your sin Jesus is Calling Jesus is Calling who come soon goes back with the Precious part of Jesus Christ Mary wanted to start a new life she was and for those of you who have been there you can imagine what that must be like life is going to change when I am to Joseph praise the Lord you guys come right down here but the Lord had another plan and that was not just to give her a new life with Joseph listen to me it was to put a new life inside of her something more than she could imagine I believe that's true for some of you in this room to say the Lord wants to give you more than you would even ask from him that's why when it comes to the end of the year we say Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year you know what I I spell Mary I said God wants you to have a merry m-a-r-y Christmas and a happy new you that begins here you know sometimes one of my sons says dad there's all kinds of people who come to the church and some of them I've known from high school and I know some of the things you're talking about are Theology and the Bible it's great for Christians but sometimes I'm not sure they understand and maybe that's you maybe you look at other people in this room and say I I don't know that I really fit in and I haven't been a Christian I ain't come from a Christian family I got a rough background and my", "parents weren't saved and I don't know much about this stuff listen I with all my heart wants you to know today we're just saying hey can we take the Gospel of Jesus and put him down for everybody to hear he loves you he died for you he's coming back and he wants you and his family if you want to receive the gift that he has to give you so I'm not sure I even understand the gift and come and see it's better than you could imagine he has more to give you this Christmas this day but you do have by the way if you brought a friend if you brought a neighbor maybe a loved one and you're not sure where they stand with the Lord and you've been praying for them keep praying but be willing to say hey if you'll go up I'll go with you and you take them by the hand don't force them to come and invite them to come with you up to the front we're going to sing again and if you want to make a public professional crisis I want to receive him today I need to know that I'm forgiven I want him to be the Lord of my life because my life needs forgiveness and I need help you get out of your seats and you come let's sing again but you come come today there's no reason we'll come to the precious bright of Jesus Christ there's still time we're gonna just sing one more time but here's what I want to say to you the flesh is always going to struggle with this decision your own human nature is going to say do I need to do this I'm not sure I need to do this I'm not ready to do this I'll do this another time not today I wasn't pla you'll have a million the enemy will always give you a way to say no not yet but the Bible says now is the day of salvation now is the acceptable time the Bible says don't Harden your heart when God is speaking to you you know why because if you harden your heart it will harden your hearing it'll be easier to say no the next time in fact some of you who are saying no right now is because you said no every other time in your life to come into Christ and God's saying I'm knocking at the door don't let me stop knocking you need to hear your opportunity is now and I believe there are some of you you've been brought up in a Christian", "home and maybe the witness of your parents is part of what has made it difficult for you to say yes to Jesus because they weren't perfect they weren't sinless some of them were Hypocrites maybe you were at a church and you saw the sin of your pastor or the sin of some spiritual leader and it offended you here you are back at church but you're back in the back rows kind of just watching not getting involved with this I do believe in God but I also struggle with putting my faith in him listen he's not asking you to put your faith in Bob company Bob company did not die for your sins I pray I never fail you but I'm human but he is the god man the Son of God and the son of man who is perfect Paul said we do not preach ourselves but we preach Jesus Christ as Lord you can trust me you can trust him and if you can't trust me you still can trust him but you have to make a decision you're going to do that my question is when did you receive him when did you put your faith on him when were you born again and if you say I can't answer that question then answer it it can be today one more time then but you've got to get out of your seat come forward and we'll pray but come the father's arms the blood of Jesus Christ praise the Lord I don't know that I know many or any of you that have come forward it's a little dark so I can't see but I do know there whom God has been working in their life see I read in the scriptures that when Jesus was born Mary and Joseph took their baby Jesus to the temple to be that was required by law the law of Moses in the Old Testament they're just a mom and a dad with a newborn baby and out of the blue this old man and this old woman one after the other come up and start talking about their baby son like they've known him their whole life Anna talks about him and she's praising God because messiah's been born in Simeon he's saying this boy has been appointed for the fall of and Rise of many in Israel starts prophesying about it's like who are you guys you know we as this is our baby boy but you know what I know this you don't have to know me to know that God's speaking to you God's spirit can speak to you and for", "some of you he has been speaking to you for a while some of you that have come and then the night that Jesus was born the Angels show up to a bunch of shepherds it's not like Mary and Joseph goes oh they're Our Shepherd neighbors hi zedekiah wasn't like that total strangers are being told about their son because God is at work in people's lives outside of us to tell them their need to meet and worship the Savior same thing was true with the wise men so we're going to pray before I do anyone else that says I should be up there my soul went up but my body's still in the seat any anybody else you want to come just one moment in time if you want to come for this decision you come now anybody than you who have come praise God would you just bow your heads with me and would you pray this prayer out loud praise the Lord we'll wait anybody else this is your moment praise God you guys let's start that prayer from the beginning bow your heads and pray this I need you I want you to be my Lord and my savior so I confess my sins I need you to forgive me come into my life cleanse my heart fill me with the Holy Spirit give me a new life where you are Lord I surrender to you today and I thank you for being born for me that I might be born again in Jesus name I pray you know you guys um when I received Christ it was not in front of a lot of people there were just three people in the room nobody nobody clapped that was fine because it's easier to do something like that in front of a small audience than it is in front of a lot it took some nerve to just even get up and walk down here but I can tell you this that you will never regret your decision to say yes to Jesus we we celebrate because here's why the Bible says if one sinner repents there's more joy in heaven over one person first service two people came forward to receive Christ and I think sometimes people feel like oh Pastor Bob only two people's like are you kidding are you kidding if the angels are celebrating who might go build me too my my joke for that is that when my sons were born and Becky you said here's your son I didn't go only one no I and that's how we feel about all of you", "guys we are celebrating with you even if you're not sure what that means like when babies are born they're not going they just are ah so if you're not sure what all this means it's okay we'll celebrate for you happy birthday by the what we're gonna do now you see that crowd of people ready to receive you that's our prayer room they're going to take you and offer you a Bible pray over you briefly and get you back out with your friends but would you guys all just go on in there together would you guys take the lead so they can move yeah praise the Lord thank god let's all worship them together let's all stand Oh What A Savior you know sometimes the best Christmas gifts are things that you've already discovered are amazing I just bought myself a Christmas gift isn't that nice of me and and you know when you have something that is awesome say this is a perfect gift for somebody else guess what that's Jesus you've opened him give him away this week tell somebody else what he's meant in your life and how they can come to know and bring them on Christmas Eve to hear the gospel but may God bless this week as you walk with him and give you peace in your way I don't believe me", "of Jacob's thigh in the sinew of the hip let's pray father we don't want to just know what happened here we need to know that but Lord would you work here in this room would you bring us through some understanding that we need tonight for our lives right now and Lord you're gonna apply this truth to us the rest of our lives had moments that are powerful God that you give us ears to hear clarity of mind no distraction but by your Holy Spirit you would come teach us principles that will help us to surrender completely to you Lord we want our nature changed we want to become like Jacob did a man or a woman who is governed by God so blessed tonight as we study in jesus name amen you can be so I almost entitled this message touched by an angel you know I think when we think of like an angel we get kind of excited can you imagine you hear stories everyone smells somebody a saw an angel or something that happened in there are occasions when that has happened not only in the Bible but but in in people's lives who bear testimony to that and we think what a blessing it would be to just see one angel well maybe maybe you need to remember something though the most common words that come out of an Angels mouth in the Bible anybody know what they are two words fear not that should tell you something about angels showing up on you unaware and even here even though Jacob at first does not have a clue that this is an angel we know it's an angel because of another passage that I'll share in just a minute so take it by faith in God's Word that I'll share with you in a minute that this is no ordinary man but it's an angel in the form of a man some believe it's the Lord Jesus Christ but that's but let's learn something about angels jot down Hebrews 1 in verse 7 Hebrews 1 in verse 7 quoting the Old Testament there says that the writer of the Hebrews says and of the Angels God says he makes his angels winds and his ministers a flame of fire they're both referring to angels he's comparing angels to Jesus in Hebrews 1 his angels are winds and his ministers a flame of fire that sounds powerful but what do you get when you get winds and fire you live in Southern California right yeah complete destruction is what you get when you put those two together", "and the idea here is of the power of angels and in fact God is going to come through this angel that wrestles or fights with Jacob at this moment in his life and literally all of his scheming to take on Esau who's coming remember with how many men a bunch four hundred men cavalry is coming with a vendetta 20 years ago he vowed he's gonna kill him and he had hoped 20 years you know he got over it he appears to not have because he's coming evidently to kill him when Jacob has no army but all of his schemes remember he's sending all these presents ahead he's sending his family across he's trying everything until he's all alone oh he have a lot but in this situation God reduces him to just himself and everything he had planned all of a security is gone I like the first verse look at it and now is Jacob gonna pardon me verse 24 then Jacob was left alone you might want to just circle the word alone there are times in your life where God will if he has to take you out of how busy you are he could do that a lot of different ways he could put you in the hospital I I've had him do that to me before where he wants to spend some time with you alone so he could cause your car to break down he loves you enough to say we need sometimes to talk it might be a short time it might be a longer time you might not sense he's even involved in it someone once said solitude is the audience chamber of God being alone as many times where God can speak to us and really for Jacob who's terrified he admits of meeting his brother for what that's gonna mean for himself and his family this is what you might call the dark night of the soul for him Jacob's gonna have a crisis of faith here on the bank of the Jabbok River where he's left alone by the way it's interesting when he met the Lord he wasn't hearing Penuel or Peniel where was he that he met God Bethel well we'd become called Bethel right was called LA's but he renamed it and by the way alone that night nobody with them that it all and sometimes that's when God can do his best work well want to jot this down let it dawn on you that you are wrestling with God let it dawn on you why do I say that because the text says he was left alone", "and a man wrestled with him until daybreak now it's interesting the words that are used in our text because not long ago we read about what I call the baby wars between the two wives and the midwives remember when Jacob has two wives and they're both trying to get his affection by having children by having sons by out bearing one another and of course this time rachel has now only born one son Joseph but through her handmaid she had born several and there was this competition going on and we read this in fact just jotted down Genesis 30 verses 7 and 8 there's some familiar words here Rachel's made Bill Huck conceived again in bora-bora a caboose ekend son next slide so Rachel said with mighty wrestling something there I have wrestled with my sister and I have indeed prevailed both of those words are gonna be used in our text tonight and so she named him Naphtali or one who wrestles in other words sometimes in our life were it struggling with other people maybe it's people in your own family like she was or maybe other people in God's family and you've got a struggle going on New Testament says we don't wrestle against flesh and blood but against principalities and powers in the high places against demonic forces so we do know we can struggle with people by the way that's one of the attributes of a carnal Christian Paul writes to the church at Corinth and he says while you're striving with one another are you not baby Christians you're just acting like regular old people who struggle with everybody else you know but we do we can wrestle with each other we can wrestle certainly with demonic forces but what is going on in this passage who is this man how do we know you know the Bible is the best commentary on the Bible don't you if you want to know what the Bible means look for anywhere else where the Bible talks it about the passenger in hosea chapter 12 talks about our text so let's take a look at verse 3 and 4 referring to Jacob in the womb he took his brother by the heel by the way that's why he got his name what Yaakov which means he'll catch her you know he's a twin identical to him but one who grabbed his brother by the heel when he came out and so they named him he'll catch a one who supplants one who who trips up somebody else and that's gonna be his character he wept now we're in our text the writer", "of hosea is our Hosea is writing about our text he Jacob wept and sought his favor the angel he found him at Bethel going back 20 years and there he spoke with us there another slide so you got it's all you got okay just curious Hosea tells us that he actually wrestled with an angel and so here's the reality that I want you to see that that's why I've entitled the message wrestling with the Almighty because Jacob did not know that he was wrestling with an angel he did not know that he was wrestling with a representative from God at all who do you think he assumed this was somebody from Esau his plan somebody that was against him some man in the night some enemy that was willing to fight him how terrifying that must have been remember in the New Testament when the apostles are arrested and they're trying to figure out what to do with them that one of the Pharisee stands up a wise respected Pharisee by the name of Gamaliel and Gamaliel tells the other Pharisees and Sadducees who are thinking about killing Peter and John be careful what you do with these men for if what they're preaching and what if they're what they're leading is just of men hey it'll it'll peter out you don't have to worry about it he gives historical examples of other movements that have come and movement said of God you don't have to worry about it if it's a man no big deal but he said if this is from God you might be found to even be fighting against God and because of that council punish them they don't kill them the way they intended very interesting Gamaliel gave wife counsel it's possible that you're fighting God you don't even know it so here's what I want to start with is it possible right now in your life someone or something you're struggling with accepting or allowing or understanding that you're actually fighting God in it and you don't know it yet it's very possible and by the way it happens more often than we think so here's what I want you to put down see how to receive the greater blessing of God the greater blessing oh god we already know Jacob is a blessed man but he's actually going to ask for and receive greater blessings tonight I call this a close encounter of the right kind the first truth and this one's hard but you gotta read it down if you want the blessing of God on your life the full", "blessing of God you need to realize God wants you broken for good broken for good you say I don't like it already at Bethel you might say Jacob got saved oh he had heard of the Lord his dad believed in the Lord he had been brought up in a believing family but at Bethel Jacob met the Lord himself at Bethel he got saved at Peniel he gets sanctified at Bethel he got converted at Peniel he will become consecrated may I say to you some of you tonight can totally relate to that in your Christian life that you were a believer in Jesus Christ for some time before you surrendered your entire life to the Lord and you can look back and say there was my Bethel there was my Peniel but some of you were here saying only not of Bethel or maybe some of your gonna going don't know what you're talking about preacher I don't have either of those the Lord wants you to come to know him in saving faith but for many of us there's then a struggle with really allowing him to be who we invited him to be what do I mean by that that if you confess with your mouth Jesus as what was it Savior no it's not you say what's all kind of the same thing Savior Lord know that he is he has died on the cross for my sin risen from the dead he's my hope of heaven and forgiveness of sins people want to take advantage of that but that if you'll confess with your mouth Jesus says jacorey us supreme master of my life jesus said if anyone wishes to come after me let him deny himself take up his cross and follow me are you a disciple of Jesus have you decided that you won't hold on to your life or are you saying Lord I don't want to go to hell when I die I want all the benefits but I'm not sure about the cost of becoming your follower like that well interesting that the Lord sends an angel to wrestle with Jacob now here's a good question why would God want to wrestle with us let me ask you why do you think God would want to wrestle with us why would he want to wrestle with Jacob yeah to Humble us that's certainly gonna happen here yeah to break our will it's gonna happen anybody else yeah for us to see how weak we really are cuz he already knows right like you ever arm wrestled I know a lot", "of us happen with issue told Melissa arm wrestled and and you were in it with somebody and then you realized oh they're messing with me or you were messing with them's like oh you know obviously we have a mix a mismatch here so it's not that God needs to see how weak Jacob is but Jacob needs to see that what anybody else why to strengthen us okay and change us what he else I would wrestle ya to get to the end of your strength that's certainly what is gonna happen in our text you know I have I have three sons I've never had daughters and I got Nooh he wouldn't give me a daughter because I would have walked down the aisle to present her you know to get married and I would have gotten about halfway and said this isn't happening I would have taken Rasul he said you can't can't trust you with that so three sons and two grandsons and while I probably did more of it when I was younger I still like wrestling with my mic my grandsons don't like wrestling with my sons anymore but with my with my grandsons but I used to rest with a Christian all the time we have little fights on the way to school we'd slap each other just for fun you know just messing around it was just kind of the way we were but but I do that even with little Jeffery he's only 1 years old he can't wrestle much you know so I always win it's really nice but why do I like to wrestle with him I'm gonna give you a word you might just want to jot this down why does God make you wrestle with them ready for the word intimacy intimacy you see when I wrestle with my sons were close very close and here's another thing that happens when I wrestle with my son or my grandson there's some things that they discover about me they discover one that I'm stronger than them that's why I don't wrestle with my sons anymore I wrestle with my grandson I'm much much stronger than him you know a chance and I sometimes will fake him out he'll think I'm gonna rock one way I'll rock another way and so he's kind of surprised but he'll learn I'm never gonna hurt him I'm never gonna injure him but I'll protect him because I love him listen God doesn't wrestle with you because he's mad at you where he's gonna punish you but God wants to wrestle with you to get you to a place he wants you", "to be here's the reality and we see it in our text the greater blessing of God let me say it twice the greater blessing of God comes in his breakings in our life and in his breaking down of our will the psalmist says the nearest our apartment the nearness of God is my good and I seen God saying I want to wrestle with Jacob tonight jog down psalm 119 verse 67 a psalmist says before I was afflicted I went astray but now I keep your word God you're using pain in my life to get me where you want me to be and when I wrestled just like I do with my son's I closer he discovers things so Jacobs gonna discover some things about the Lord tonight in this text so if you're going through a hard time with God you don't know why God is not allowing that by the way Jobe struggled with the Lord you're in good company at the end God had to say to him you are a fault finder but you're contending with the Almighty you're never gonna win this battle but you can win if you'll surrender interesting what happens is Jacobs hip is dislocated now from what I can see in the text it's pretty severe think about this why would God want to actually dislocate maybe even most Bible teachers believe he was not just wounded but crippled for life and I'll show you why we think that in a minute Jacobs hip is dislocated here's something to think about after this Jacob is now no longer to do what he's always relied on run he is a good runner 20 years before he ran from the consequences with Esau he's gone through a lot few days before this he's running from somebody else Laban have you noticed that's the way he handles life just run I run and God's gonna say enough no more running from you or for you and no running from me you've all heard of that shepherd who has that rebellious sheep who just no matter what he does he goes and he gets him he's in danger he pulls him back he wanders away and he brings it back repeatedly until finally he has to take severe action and he'll break the leg of that wandering sheep they say that they the shepherd would put that sheep actually on his shoulders to lead the other sheep they have to go that little sheep can't walk a broken leg it's being meant it's gonna take weeks or months and during that time that little rebellious sheep will", "get super close to that shepherd and have a relationship even different than the rest of the sheep and when it's healed I'll never stray again God will use pain in our life not just to get our attention but many times to actually change who we are I love that about Jacob he is going to be broken tonight but here's the reality you say I want to be blessed of God so do i but what if he told you to bless you I have to break you how many stay on that sign-up sheet it's gonna hurt I will bless you but I must break you you see Jacob had desires just like all of us do as well but quite often what we're praying for what we want isn't what's best for us and we just don't know it listen to this this was a prayer written out that was found in the pocket of a civil war soldier that was shot and killed at Gettysburg he wrote this I asked for strength that I might achieve God made me weak that I might obey I asked for health that I might do great he gave me grace that I might do better things I asked for riches that I might be happy but he gave me poverty then I might be wise I asked for power that I might have the praise of men he gave me weakness that I might feel a need for God I asked for all things that I might enjoy life he gave me life that I might enjoy all things I received nothing that I asked for he gave me everything that I had hoped for and so it is that Jacob who is terrified of Esau actually has some bigger business to deal with than he even knows and by the way I find that often to be the case quite often God will allow conflict or problem might be health it might be family it might be relationships that often is might be personal struggles might be financial and we are all focused on these big problems and our bigger problem that has to do with our relationship with the we're not even focused there but God will take us from that conflict that we're in and get our eyes off of the conflict onto himself and change us for good I love that so god breaks things to bless them what does the Bible say Jesus broke the bread and He blessed it he broke the bread and He blessed it that woman took that alabaster box of expensive spiked nard", "she broke it that she might bless the Lord Jesus said this is my body broken for you jot down Matthew 21 and verse 44 thinking about breaking and how it's God's will listen to this verse Jesus says he's the stone the builders have rejected he's become the chief Cornerstone and then he says this interesting statement he who falls on this stone referring to himself he who falls on this stone will be what broke well that sounds horrible well here's the alternative on whomever the stone falls it'll scatter him like dust anyone is there a third option nope though it's just those two judgment the stone is either going to judge you or best-case scenario the only thing really that you want fall on him and be broken to pieces you say that's and sound fun no it doesn't but it's exactly what God intends for us to be broken what is Paul say in the New Testament st. Krynn thien's we are like earthenware vessels what did God make out him out of dirt out of the dust of the earth breathed into his nostrils the breath of life you're dirt no offense so my shouldn't look down on dirt it's just that's right my sons we used to say your hands are dirty where it's time to eat you need to watch the a God made dirt and dirt don't hurt that was one of their lines yeah go wash anyway but you and I are simply the ingredients of what we are charged and I love the fact that God knows that he knows your frame that you're but dust he knows your limitations but God is purposed to put his glory the glory of the gospel and the life of Christ into clay pots into earthenware vessels into your life you are fragile you have flaws you break easily but good news we're not preaching ourselves when we break it's an opportunity for the light to shine just think Gideon and those clay pots and the torches that shine when they were broken the breaking is the opportunity for the glory of God to go right through your life it's when you are hurting the most what did God say to Paul who wanted the thorn in the flesh removed I'm gonna leave it right where it is because I'm gonna accomplish something that otherwise would never happen if I took it away what if what you or I are praying so hard for God change us God change us and he says I wanna I love you too much I have something better for", "your life and for your witness if I don't I know we don't like to hear it but if we trust God will accept it now if you want the great blessing of God in your life you have to ask him for it put this down cry out to the Lord for His blessing look at verse 26 after his hip is dislocated then he said let me go now he's fighting one moment in the next moment the angel is saying to Jacob let me go the dawn is breaking but Jacob said I will not let you go unless you bless me something has happened between verse 25 and 26 they are literally in a contest it appears for their life Jacob's not winning that the angel reaches out and simply touches him and some realization must have come over Jacob this is not Esau's guy he's wounded he's broken he's defeated suddenly he knows it's the presence of God and now he's hanging on for dear life and the angel says gotta go and Jacob says I'll let you go I now realize who you are I your you're an angel of God your problem god I need your blessing on my life I need your power in my life Jacob here in this moment is broken but he is not beaten that no no I mean by that Paul the Apostle says we are cast down but we're not destroyed yes we get tossed around in this life but God only allows that that he might accomplish something better and here we see Jacob holding on to the Lord and asking him for his blessing gara ask God to bless you do you feel guilty ask him Jacob says I won't let you go unless you bless me it's interesting he has a dislocated hip here's what I don't hear him saying he doesn't say God please heal me now see I would have been saying could you put that back together you really messed it up real quick I mean commend that malthus the ear thing could you could reverse it not a word about healing I'm not interesting I don't want you to heal me I want you to bless me here's my suggestion bless me in and through the brokenness that you clearly willed into my life victory for us as believers in this life and the blessing of God comes through insistent prayer and persistent prayer by the way Hosea is talking about Jacob as praying to God and crying and weeping and suppliant I won't let you go unless you bless me now there's a part of me", "the one I read that what nerve well bless my life can we just remember the Jacob just a few verses earlier in this chapter look at verse 10 just a few minutes ago as it were 32 10 he said I am unworthy of all the loving-kindness and all of the faithfulness which you have shown to your servant for with my staff only I crossed this Jordan now I become to he has just bragged to God of how he is clothes he has everything he has y'see as kids he has money he has flocks and he has the nerve to say uh-uh board really I mean I'm shocked than the angel didn't dislocate the other hip I mean seems over-the-top but what if what if Jacob understands that there's a blessing from God that'll never come in a paycheck that'll never come in the cars you drive it'll never be registered in terms of your your estate's value it can't be registered even in the people that you love that you count so dear and all the blessings that happen with people and stuff what if there's a blessing beyond that that God has for bless me I'm not talking about more stuff I'm not even talking about more people I'm talking about a blessing that only comes from you what did James say you have not because what you ask not see Jacob knew the promise of God on his life not only had he met the Lord back at Bethel that his own father had pronounced a blessing on his life God's gonna bless you son you radical blessing God Himself wants to bless you you know it's it's interesting we might read The Wall Street Journal to know how we should invest our money wisely or you might read you know Good Housekeeping to know how to make your home a nice place to be your good parenting to know how to take care of kids nothing wrong with that but why is it we fail to read the book that gives us God's promises on how the blessing of God might come on our you see when Jacob said bless me I won't let you go unless you bless me he's holding God to the promise that he has already made in his life you know George Mueller of Bristol was a man of great faith if you've ever studied anything about him you know that he had a heart for orphans and he literally prayed millions of English Pounds into the ministry and trusted God incredibly but here's what George Mueller Bristol said quote I take the promises of the word", "and I argue with the Lord not in order to convince God but in order to convince myself in other words I pray to God the promises that he's made to remind me and to give me faith to keep asking him for you know I think God is looking to bless people remember how that passage says the eyes of the Lord moved to and fro throughout the whole earth looking for someone to show himself strong on their behalf whose heart is totally his what I think about what does that mean God's looking for someone if you think about it I'll paraphrase it to bless to use whose heart is totally his no self will and who wants to trust him for a new work of blessing in their life so that he might use them in a greater way what if this is true God is looking for people listen to me now who will not take no for an answer from God prematurely let me say that again what if God is looking for someone who won't take no prematurely as an answer from God he said what do you mean it jot Mathew 15 verses 25 through 28 matthew 15 25 syrophoenician woman came and began to bow down before jesus saying lord help me he said hey it's not good to take the children's bread throw it to nextslide but she said yes Lord but even the dogs feed on the crumbs which fall from their master's table then jesus said to her a woman your faith is great it shall be done for you as you wish and her daughter was healed at once when she first comes up Jesus asking for Jesus's help if you read the text he ignores her he doesn't even answer her she is not a Jew he's only been sent to the lost sheep of the house of Israel completely ignores her seems very almost like what Lord Jesus sure Jesus it'll be nice to and when he does speak he says that the answer's no doesn't that blessing doesn't belong to you but he ministers to her do we really think he didn't want to and she kind of convinced him to do so how about of the Old Testament let me let me give you a different one children of Israel have sinned take any one of the many times they did that and God says Moses stand back I am going to obliterated of Israel in fact I'll start a new nation we'll call it the moses i'ts remember God does one of those and what is Moses", "yeah he basically says god it's good idea at all it's not that I wouldn't like the name but mmm you you know people watching it almost sounds like Moses had calmed down God and he intercedes do you not know that God is giving Moses an opportunity to be like Christ to say destroy me listen to me God had no intention of not fulfilling his promises to his people but God is working on Moses Luke 24 Jesus is on the road to a mass with two guys who are sorrowful because Messiah Jesus of Nazareth has died they don't know it's Jesus who's walking with him he's very much alive and as they are coming he's been sharing from the Word of God with them from the Old Testament about all the things the Old Testament said in Messiah must do including suffer and die and they didn't get all those passages together they didn't understand that Messiah had to die to enter his glory and so Jesus is bringing them through the great Bible study we know cuz later they'll say does not our hearts burn within us when he spoke to us the Word of God along the way but he's doing that and the Bible says they come to the village where the two men were going to a mass and then there's this interesting little part that says and Jesus made it look as though he was going to go farther in other words see guys now wait a minute did Jesus really want to go farther or was he going to wait for them to say hey hey hey we can we finish that Bible study over communion or you know dinner I don't know all I know is Jesus appears to be doing something he's giving them an opportunity to respond here's what I want you to know there are times God is in apparently it looks like ignoring us when he's not the question is what do you do when God seems to say no do you keep knocking at the door or you go oh I don't want to bug you anymore God on that I asked you once or twice fascinating to me I will not let you go until you bless me bible says jesus said it seek keep seeking you'll find knock don't stop until the doors open I ask and keep asking and then if you want the blessing of God in your life put this down confess who you really are verse 27 is an interesting verse when he said I won't let you go until you bless", "me here's how the Lord responds so he said to him what is your name now look the Lord knows his name Jacob knows his name he's gonna say Jacob what is going on here just this if God is going to have all of your life you're gonna have to be very honest about who you are Jacob's getting it a new name in a moment in this verse changing transformative moment in his life but to get there he's got to start with who he is and by the way this should bring back a memory for Jacob because the last time he was being asked who he was was when his own dad who was going blind said who son are you he saw remember when he tricked his father and so God uses very similar words what is your name he wants him to say it I want you to say it I am Jacob because you see he had said he was Esau that night there's a lot of people who don't want to be who they are Jake I wanna he saw his blessings I want what he I'm jealous of him I'm jealous of her I want what you know I've always said that for a Christians a lot of times the gifts are always greener on the other brother well I wish I could sing if I can just sing like that man I can I would love it maybe maybe that person is singing is looking at something with you know I wish my hair oh I wish I was kind like that or funny you don't know but they when you say you want to be somebody else something is wrong you're not accepting who God has made you and God is gonna change not only in Jacobs name he's gonna change his nature tonight what does the Bible say if any man is in Christ he's what new creation Jacob will never be Jacob again after this night he is going through a change so he's reminding him of his past and he's wanting him to be honest about his past and God is bringing him right back to an area that he has to get right if you or I want God to have all that we are to become all that he intends us to be we have to start by admitting or not that now and we have never been that then put this down become one known to be governed by God in verse 28 he said your name and you could just write into that word name nature cuz that's the", "idea your nature your name will no longer be somebody's ripping other people off but instead yes Rael literally Israel for you have contended or striven wrestled with God and with men and you have prevailed hmm it's interesting here we see Jacob he had been fighting God and now broken he's just holding on to the Lord I won't let you go shut down Psalm 63 and verse 8 Psalm 63 verse 8 David said my soul clings to you in your right hand upholds me Martin Luther's wife was Katherine Katherine's dying words were I will cling to Christ like a burr to a topcoat I am gonna hold on to him what did Jobs say though he slay me yet shall I hope in him if I'm going out I don't understand why gods allowed all the hurt suffering in my life my body but if I'm gonna die I'm gonna go out trusting holding on to him you see and so he gets a new name a name that could be translated governed by God that's what it means to be consecrated to the Lord you're no longer saying Lord would you help me with this would you help me with that I just I'm trying to do this or I'm trying to figure it out myself you're saying god I just want to discover what your will is I am now your servant I am your disciple I like to say disciples don't make decisions they make discoveries I'm not deciding what I haven't got to do why because my life is not my own I'm gonna say Lord what do you want for my life and when I get back to trying to run it myself Lord I'm gonna repent over that new name governed by God quite a name quite a claim can you imagine being an atheist and having the name Christian so there are some I'm sure parents named you Christian may they like the sound of it maybe they were believers who knows they pray it over their kid but I'm an atheist something in conflict there let me ask you who else gets a new name in the Bible Abram becomes Abraham Sarah Sarah I becomes Sarah Peter his name was formerly Simon or Cephas becomes Peter salt uses we don't have God changing his name but he changes it to Paul which means little anybody else Hosea becomes Joshua Moses gives him a new name Joseph and then book of Acts becomes Barnabas which means son of encouragement there are a lot of examples of people who God or men change", "their name and in every case when it comes to believers it's always for the no one ever get a worse name like knowing I'm calling you annoying from you know and there's none of that in Scripture and I was thinking about this because the Bible teaches that that's exactly gonna be true for us as God's people jog down by Isaiah 62 to the nation's we'll see your righteousness and all Klink kings your glory and you will be called by a new name which the mouth of the Lord will designate and there in Revelation the Church of Jesus Christ that believers are given a new name I think of jay-bez in the Old Testament you know jay-bez his name means means grief grief and sorrow and his mother named it that because with sorrow she bore him so how'd you like your name to be a pain you know hey pain come over here yeah you are that you're gonna live up your name of course you're doing that again Pigpen I was like a name like Pigpen in Charlie Brown it's pretty obvious what you are bringing into the and you bring your own environment with you jay-bez said god I want you to bless me he liked Jacobs I want you to bless me I don't want to bring I don't want to be a messenger of pain I don't want more pain I want your blessing on my life that I might bring you honor that's what it means I think to come to know Jesus Christ to say Lord in myself in my flesh I am a Jacob and I have brought a lot of hurt to other people change my nature change my name Lord I want my new name I want to be governed by God and then put this down seek to singularly know God better you want the blessing of God on your life then make this your singular request look at verse 29 and 30 then Jacob asked him he's asking the angel very interesting the angel says what's your name and so it's coming Wow we're playing the name game what's yours didn't see your name tag to the angel Jacob as him and said please tell me your name but he said why is it that you ask my name and he blessed him right there now this is interesting to why do you want to know someone's name know what to call him biblically why do you want to know someone's name let me ask you what is revealed in the names of God his attributes his character we could sit", "here in for the next 10 minutes so we don't have much more on time than that to be together we could start reciting names of Jesus and names of God it's always encouraging to discuss he is Emmanuel he is el-shaddai he is El Elyon and we go through the names and we're encouraged to remember yes his multiple attributes and assets the beauty of the Lord is revealed in his name the righteous run into the name of the Lord and they're safe you see because he's a rock he's a refuge as a fortress when Jacob is asking the name of the one who represents the Lord please massa just to you what's going on in his life is he's broken he's holding on to the Lord if you will and he's saying I want to know you I want to know you better is that not what Paul the Apostle said the desire of his life was in Philippians 3 I forget what lies behind and I press forward for the upward call of God in Jesus Christ that I may know him that I may know him and the power of the Resurrection the Fellowship of us I want to know him what did Jeremiah God said through Jeremiah don't boast about your money or your muscles or your PhD in your brains let him who boasts boast in this that he knows and understands me and I see already in Jacob there's this passion to know God better hmm by the way something I just want you to notice in passing here is you know who's never mentioned even once in this text he saw this was all about he saw this this fear and he was all about this thing it's about to happen the next day Esau's come in yesterday night sorry Esau is coming he's terrified and suddenly he's not even relevant to the story anymore by the way remember when they Elijah wanted to die remember that was right after the great victory I'm not Carmel and the victory over the prophets and all that and the fire fell and was great mountaintop experience literally but then he finds out Jezebel is upset that he killed all her prophets I can understand that but she has put out a hit on Elijah you're dead you're as dead as my prophets it's just a matter of time wiping you out and Elijah freaks out he's ready to stand up all the prophets of bale and bail himself and god it's amazing but this woman Jezebel is like reminds me a Peter at the campfire by the way I'll fight the", "soldiers but those little campfire girls he has trouble but anyway Elijah runs go south a spear she passed the border outside of Jezebel's jurisdiction sits down under a tree and says I want to go home I hate this life I've stood for you and I'd he's moping he's he wants to die he says God kill me huh God says let's talk my place Mount Horeb you know it's interesting when the logic gets there go read the text not one mention of Jezebel not one mention of the fact that she's threatened to kill he she's out there it's irrelevant what he needs is a face-to-face with God and when that happens it just isn't a tissue anymore what jessabelle was threatening by the way very similar to this the book of Job job through the whole book wants to meet with God to understand why are you allowing these things to happen to me I haven't done anything wrong you took my children you took my wealth you took my red bag took my health he idea let's go to court I want to talk to God until God shows up and it's like you know what I mean no I'm good it's amazing what you need is not a solution to that conflict to that problem and you're like what you need is a face-to-face encounter with God and when that happens those other things just but who cares about Queen Jezebel or Esau come and let him take I am not worried about it I just saw the Lord face to face I managed to come alive through that you can't see God's face and live but I just did and he is ready for whatever God has for him then walk step by step in utter dependence verse 31 now the Sun rose upon Jacob just as he crossed over Penuel and he was limping on his thigh now this is why this is important to me we told you he has years still about forty some years to live bunch of chapters still about his life but something happens to him here and he's limping away from this encounter with God he is wounded I believe he's crippled for life and he's limping on his staff jot down Hebrews 11 21 we talked about living by faith not as much about dying by faith but the Bible does what does it mean to die in faith Hebrews 11 and verse 21 we have that one guys there it is by faith Jacob as he was dying there's a guy's about to die in faith blessed each of", "the sons of Joseph and worshiped what's that next pray say he was leaning on his staff don't just picture this little ornament that he carried around with him he didn't carry a cane anymore the new wood for nothing he is leaning on his staff the day that he dies and from this day to that day every single step he had a lien on that staff why because God has taught him that in his brokenness he cannot depend on himself any more and God wants to break that in you and break that in me too to say Lord I don't trust I rather I'm gonna rely upon you very interesting especially when twenty years earlier when he met the Lord at Bethel the Hebrew text tells us Jacob got up and the Hebrew cometh it's like he's met the Lord and he's heading now for her and he was running he was worried he was tired but he wakes up after meeting Lauren and Bethel and it's kind of like Jacob wakes up with happy feet that's really the idea of the Hebrew he is energized but it it's not Happy Feet anymore the spring in his step is gone in fact he has a limp for the rest of his life listen the Bible says in Isaiah 53 Jesus Christ was wounded for our transgressions may I suggest to you God will wound us in order for us to learn our lessons there are things we can only learn through God allowing pain to come into our life and here's what basically Jacob learned if I don't trust in the Lord if I don't depend on him I'll fall flat on my face and now I know that and finally verse 32 put this down see where your life's legacy is because verse 32 suddenly we come out of the time that we're in and Moses is now writing centuries later about what happened because Jacob was wounded or crippled in his socket he tells us how the children of Israel throughout these ages have taken that truth and here's the idea what God touches becomes holy he touched Jacob in the thigh and now to honor that verse 32 therefore to this day the sons of Israel do not eat the sinew of the hip which is on the socket of the thigh because God touched through the angel the socket of Jacob's thigh and the sinew of the hip somebody sure to book with me once called halftime interesting concept I think a lot of us in this room would be able to relate to it they said", "the first half of your life you're going if your man is success you want to be successful want to provide for your family you want to get ahead in your career success but there comes a point in your life it's not always halfway through but there comes a point when you stop thinking so much about success and your goal instead is significance the question is what will my life have meant to anyone what will it have meant to my family my children my friends to the church what well here's what you want to remember whatever God touches in your life becomes holy Jacob's sons would be able to make this statement my dad limped through life let he learn to lean on the Lord he he limped the rest of his life he had shortcomings he had physical but but he trusted in God interesting Jesus touches the bread and he breaks it and only then if you read the text where he fed the 5000 does he use it to bless other people he touches it he breaks it and then he gives it as a blessing to other people what if your legacy what if what you have to leave behind you isn't the amount of money you make or your your accomplishments at work or or in life what if it's none of that what if it's the way you limp what if it's where God has touched you and by touching you you have accepted his lordship in your life and it's broken you but while you limp in that area you lean on the Lord in such a way that people will never forget that about you well yeah they weren't perfect they they had their shortcomings they had their struggles but they totally relied on the Lord step by step day by day they gave up running from the Lord to learn to walk on behalf of our pastors and staff we want to thank you for tuning into today's video if you want to stay informed about what's going on here at Calvary Chapel UC Anaheim we'd love for you to subscribe to our Channel go ahead and do so by clicking the button below", "special time Christmas day like you'd open your Bibles now to the Book of Numbers Numbers Chapter 10. Numbers chapter 10 beginning in verse 11. so 10 11. numbers 10 now in the second year he's talking about second year since they came out of Egypt in the second year in the second month on the 20th of the month the cloud was lifted from Over the Tabernacle of the testimony and the sons of Israel set out on their Journeys from the Wilderness of Sinai then the clouds settled down in the wilderness of Paran so they moved out for the first time according to the Commandment of the Lord through Moses the standard of the camp of the sons of Judah according to their army set out first with nashon the son of aminidab over its Army and Nathaniel the son of zwar over the tribal Army of the sons of issachar in the light of the son of Helen over the tribal Army of the sons of zebden then the Tabernacle was taken down sons of Gershon and the sons of murari who were carrying the Tabernacle they set out next the standard of the camp of according to their armies set out with elizur the son of shidur over its Army and shalomil the son of well you can do that one yourself zuras shoddy over the tribal Army of the sons of Simeon and eliasaf the son of duel was over the tribal Army of the sons of God then the cohathites remember they're the ones that carry the furniture the Furnishings of the Tabernacle set out carrying the holy objects and the Tabernacle was set up before their arrival next the standard of the camp of the sons of Ephraim according to their armies was set out with hila shama the son of aminahu but I can't say that one over its Army and Gamaliel the son of Perez or over the tribal Army of the sons of Manasseh and abedin the son of gideoni gideoni giddy upy over the tribal Army of the sons of Benjamin then the standard of the camp of the sons of Dan according to their armies which was formed which formed the rear guard for all the camps set out without his or the son of amishadi over its Army and pagyal the son of okran over the tribal Army of the sons of Asher and nahira the son of Enon over the tribal Army of the sons of naphtali this was the order of March of the sons of Israel by their armies as they set out verse 29 then", "Moses said to hobab the son of ruelle the midianite Moses's father-in-law we're setting out to the place which the Lord said I will give it to you come with us we will do you good for the Lord has promised good concerning Israel but he said to him I will not come but rather will go to my own land and my relatives then he said please do not leave us in as much as you know where we should camp in the wilderness and you will be eyes for us so it will be if you go with us that whatever good the Lord does for us well we will do for you thus they set out from the Mount of the Lord that's Sinai three days journey with the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord journeying in front of them for three days to seek out a resting place for them cloud of the Lord was over them by day when they set out from the camp and then it came about when the ark set out that Moses said rise up O Lord let your enemies be scattered and let those who hate you flee before you when it came to rest Moses said return O Lord to the Myriad thousands of Israel father now we just pray your spirit would take your word we know it's alive but we pray that we would be awake and alert to what you're saying to the church and that you would speak to us individually in Jesus name amen thanks for your patience and happy letting me read through that as best I could you know um going through the Old Testament going through genealogies or lists of things that are hard to read and you kind of think what's kind of monotonous and all here on Wednesday nights we have faced this many times and just a reminder to all of us as we listen the Bible says of itself that it is inspired not just it's inspiring but the Bible says of itself they're in second Corinthians 3 or a second uh Timothy 3 that all scripture is inspired by God it's it comes from and the word literally means god breathed God's word is God breathe and I think about what the scripture says concerning when God made man the Bible says in the Book of Genesis God formed Man Out of the Dust of the Earth and then he breathed into man into his nostrils the breath of life and he became a living nephesian the Hebrew a living Soul he came alive he was inanimate and God breathed in them it's", "kind of like you're just blowing up you know like I'm doing a mouth to mouth but God put something that animated what was inanimate before before God made him he was he was physically everything that he was without the Breath of God but he was dead had no life interesting picture that God in a breath brings the inanimate to life when God speaks his word the Bible says scripture is all scripture is alive the word of God is alive that's in Hebrews 4 12. the word of God is living alive not just it's moving it's got nice stuff in it no no it has a spiritual quality to it that no other nothing else you read ever has God's word is it shares the same quality what God did to Man by breathing into his nostrils and he became like God's word is the same way it that means this the Bible will be alive for all of eternity we know God's word is eternal that means that every book of the Bible every chapter of the Bible I believe really every verse and every word every jot and Tittle of the word of God is dripping with the life of God it has purpose it has power if we'll simply take the time and we're going to have the time in all of eternity we just get a few seconds to go through it here tonight and look for for some of the gems that God's given us there's so much more than we ever get but be encouraged as you read your Bible even when you struggle with it I don't really know why this is here yeah but it doesn't mean there's not a reason just means you haven't discovered it yet but you will in time and you will certainly in eternity so I'm I have a just the joy of spending some time in some of those maybe harder to study passages for many people or passages that people skip over to say Lord would you give us some truth here Living Truth for our lives so the nation of Israel has been camped out at Mount Sinai now for a year they've received the Ten Commandments they've received the law they have built the Tabernacle and they've started doing sacrifices and of course now they've come to that point where they start the move they're going that's why I've called this one on the Move they're moving out from that time with the Lord at Mount Sinai after a year to finally get on the march to go to the promised land put this down there", "is a time to move out and there is a time to move on and this is the time in the in the passage and so just look at again some of the words there in verse 11. it gives us the timing in verse 11 it was the second year so they've been there for a year and now they're going into the second year and the exact date the cloud was lifted over the Tabernacle of the testimony remember we said that the cloud the Shekinah presence of God rested on the Tabernacle it was it was his visible manifestation many would call it a christophany and the reason they do that is we believe that Jesus the second person of the Trinity is the one who is given to reveal God anytime God is being revealed in any kind of manifestation since God is Spirit he doesn't manifest himself in a physical tangible way the second person of the Trinity does that he's the fullness of the godhead dwelling bodily but Jesus reveals God he is the law loss the he if there's something to know about God Jesus is the one who's revealing him whether it's the burning bush or the cloud these are christophany so This Cloud represents the presence of God and as it moves out that was the signal there to blow the trumpets and they were to move out and so it says in verse 13 so they moved out for the very first time according to the Commandment of God so a principle for us is there are times when the Lord calls us into a time a season of being in a place but then there's a time when it's time to move and we need to be sensitive to that we talked about that before so I don't want to elaborate too much but put this down we need to embrace the journey and change accept change they've been there for a year a lot has happened a lot of good things have happened at Mount Sinai that they've discovered God's presence his holy presence they've been collecting Manna every day for a year now in the wilderness they had seed God's provision they've enjoyed his presence but now to go on why because Sinai was not their Canaan is their inheritance they've never been there before and and there are times I think that we settle we would settle for deal this isn't bad this is kind of neat I have this unique relationship with God I've seen him do some amazing things here I carved my name in the cactus you know I this is", "kind of my place and and yet I've also noticed that after people get saved many times there is this season many times not always but there's a season for a lot of people it's kind of a sweet season with the Lord where things are different things are radical and they're blessed beyond all measure and the Lord kind of withdraws some of his trials from their life gives them Victory maybe over some addiction or some problems they've had and gives them just the joy of walking with him and then there comes a point where it's time now to get on the journey that's going to be more arduous and new Trials come into their life I've watched that happen with many people the fact is all of us are the same way we prefer what's comfortable how many of you are sitting in the seat or doggone close to it the one you have sat in before tonight just raise your and some of you just lying so it's good how have you parked as pretty much in the same zip code you always kind of Park in okay now there's nothing wrong with how many of you ate at a restaurant you've eaten in before today you've been how many of you ate at your own house today see same thing no just kidding um we just by human age we prefer what's comfortable and familiar however while it's not a bad thing always Comfort can lead to complacency it just can it is the enemy many times complacency is of of character look I once lived somewhere for a relatively short amount of time I really wasn't there but I was very comfortable there and I had to move and I resisted it in fact it's embarrassing to admit that I cried when I had to move because I was from my had and so did you that was the first place I re well I don't remember but I was told I lived and I was there for only nine months and but I didn't want to go I that wasn't my idea and and you know what it starts out like that but just because we get older doesn't mean it always changes there is no growth without challenge and without change in every single new experience of your life one of two things is going to happen either you're going to trust God as you're being tested and it'll it'll bring out the best in you or you're going to disobey God and you're not going to trust God and Satan is going to bring out the worst in you", "either way it's an opportunity to grow that's just the way it is when things are different things are new and they will be all through your life but there are seasons that are a gift from God and then it's time to go well put this down the saved must become spiritual soldiers soldiers put in the word soldiers this chapter over and over again describes the nation of Israel you know not long ago a little over a year ago they were slaves and then as of Passover they became saved they were released from from slavery so they were slaves then they were saved and now the saved are becoming soldiers this chapter describes them all as an army suddenly the nation went from say sojourners to Sojourner soldiers so if that's true and it is true that those who he saves now have to take on that role on this journey which by the way the journey to the promised land let me just stick this in the back of your mind the journey to the promised land is not what a lot of people think it is typically people because of some what they used to call Negro spirituals the spirituals describe the promised land that's really not the biblical picture although many people they get that in their mind you know that that we're going to canaan's land and that's that's heaven now actually the Victorious is the promised land how do I know that because when they get to Canaan there are still enemies that have to be fought when you get to heaven there aren't going to be any no no the picture is not of dying at the Jordan and going into heaven it's talking about entering into the full Promises of God that he has for you you see the fruitfulness of the Christian Life and this journey experience a lot of us are are there struggling with being tested in the Lord but we're being called to inherit the promises of God so we must understand that as a Believer there are going to be both in the promised land and on the way there here put this down we must accept hardship and attacks hardships and attacks Jesus said in the world you will have what was it yeah five of us know that one in the world you will have I wish he said celebration well you might have some of those too but he's a tribulation don't you know what the word is for the word tribulation in the Greek it's the word flipsis you know what Ellipsis is just", "put your put your hands together right now put your hands together okay it's the space in between your hands it's it's being pressed on both sides stressed and pressure that's what Ellipsis is in the world you're going to have this going on in your life you can't avoid you're in the Fallen World and you're a Christian so you're going to have attacks more than you used to have before you're a Christian actually because you were already spoken for by the enemy but now he wants you back or if he can't get you back he just wants you backslidden so that you can't help other people second Timothy 2 verses 3 and 4 Paul uses this analogy the Christian Life is a war he said suffer hardship Timothy to this young pastor but it applies to all of us suffer hardship with me as a good soldier of Christ no soldier in active service means you know if you're been drafted no soldier in active service next slide yeah entangles himself in the Affairs of everyday life you don't go into the army and start a business so that you may please the one who enlisted you as a soldier we're told in the book of Ephesians as you know the armor of God is all listed there beginning in about verse 10 which says be strong in the Lord and the strength of his might put on the full armor of God that you might be able to stand in the evil day take up for instance the shield of faith now I go over I try to remember every day to go over each of the pieces of armor which uh I I believe talk to us about the character of Christ but I have to ever whenever I talk to the Lord about I'm going to take up the shield of faith I remind myself that a soldier picks up a shield because they're expecting incoming you know it's not the Frisbee of faith you and I are to live a life where we are expecting to be attacked and we're ready for it we shouldn't be shocked Peter says don't be surprised by this testing that comes among you with some strange thing right it'd be like a soldier boy they're shooting at us it's like hello I think you were trading for this I think you signed up for it I should be expecting it and so we now are those yes we're sojourners we're following the Lord and he's taking us someplace we've never been to receive an inheritance that he's promised us and our forefathers from the", "time of Abraham they would have said but also we realize there's some fighting that's going to have to go on and there's some hard times yet it was Spurgeon who had a publication that he put out with various thoughts from the word of God and it was called The Sword and the The Sword and the trowel that was the title of his publication taken from the book of Nehemiah because when Nehemiah was rebuilding the destroyed walls of Jerusalem and he called the nation that was living there to help them family by family all along the wall every person every family took a portion of the wall and their their kin would come out and work on it but they were stationed to both build the wall with a trowel but also carry a sword because of enemies and he's basically spiritually was saying we as Believers the same thing we have some building to do that's one of the pictures Paul says I'm a fellow worker with God you're the God's field you're God's Building he's building you but we need to do Warfare too we need to fight and we need to fight for one another so it's bull fan and as Believers we need to see we're in that there are victories and defeats in our lives and there are also casualties maybe you know a Believer who's a casualty they they're not walking with the Lord at all they've denied the Lord or maybe just somebody tonight Who's M.I.A they're just missing they're not with the lord they're not you don't know where they're at they're just they're somewhere out there or maybe even some pows and and they become really imprisoned to their sin or their deception it's a real war put this down one is destined to lead the whole nation we see this here look at verse 14 again the standard of the camp of the sons of Judah according to their armies set out first you might want to just underline that word first out of the 12 tribes it is Judah who is called To Take the Lead and we'll see this again and again by the way it'll happen again in the Book of Judges when they go into the promised land Judah takes first not only because they're the largest tribe but because of a prophecy and an intention that God has for them jot it down it's good to notice it Genesis 49 verses 10 and 11. this is a prophecy over uh the 12 sons of Jacob before he died he he said these words and they are futuristic as to what", "God's going to do with each of the tribes Genesis 49 10 says the scepter shall not depart from Judah nor the ruler staff from between his feet until Shiloh comes and to him shall be The Obedience of the peoples then this interesting prophecy that might sound Vaguely Familiar he ties his foal to the vine and his donkey's cult to the choice Vine he washes his garments and wine and robes in the blood of grapes well that's a great passage that I love teaching on that especially when it comes to this to the Palm Sunday because you have a reversal and suddenly instead of tying the donkey's cult to a Vine there's an untying of a cult but that's for another day but here what I want you to see is that God through Jacob designates Judah to be the one who is to lead the scepter staff the the Royal staff there's not even a king in Israel yet but the kings are all going to come eventually from the tribe of Judah and that's God's plan that's why David is going to be the first king chosen by God of the nation of Israel by the way does anybody know what Judah means his name means praise remember when Mom gave birth to Judah she said this time I'm just going to praise the Lord she before that was hoping each one of her sons would get her husband's attention and affection and finally she said you know this time that didn't work uh those other times I'm just going to praise the Lord and then she stopped bearing it was kind of like she finally realized I I need the right motives in my heart I'm just going to praise God for this child it's a beautiful story but it is praise that leads us as God's people we just studied this on Sunday into God's presence we just talked about that one the Samaritan who comes back and gives glory to God how praise is really the it leads us into the presence of God jot down first Chronicles 23 30. um David gives instructions that the priests certain priests Levites that they are to stand every morning it wasn't the Levites that they are to stand every morning to thank and to praise the Lord and likewise it evening very interesting God he commanded it was their job can you imagine click in okay my time to start praising the Lord but literally it's this beautiful picture this is what I want you to do constantly from the morning till the night be praising the Lord I think it's a great", "example for us Lord I want to be I want you to lead me into the day I want praise to lead me into the day and if we'll make our day start and end with praise here's what it says in the Book of Malachi from the rising of the Sun to the going down of the same the name of the Lord is to be praised got where to praise him all day but you need to start the somewhere don't start well I went Wednesday night we started praising the Lord yeah why did you wait you didn't have to wait till now well put this down number three the Lord is at the head but also in the heart why do I share that well Judah is of course the tribe from which the Messiah will come that is by the way the prophecy that we just read when it says that the scepter staff will not depart from between his feet until Shiloh comes Shiloh is an epithet a name for messiah and the Messiah must come from the tribe of Judah which of course our lord Jesus did but while we see Judah is to take the lead because it's going to be the Messianic tribe ultimately it's also interesting to me what we're told in the text concerning uh the tribe of the kohethites look at verse 21 then the kohethites verse 21 set out carrying the holy objects of the Tabernacle now we've studied this so I won't go over all the seven pieces of furniture in the in the Tabernacle you probably know them very well we have gone over in great detail how each one of them is a type or a picture of Jesus Christ everything from the Brazen altar to the especially the Ark of the Covenant but everything in between you know the the table of showbread the labor the uh Frank the altar of incense and and of course the menorah these represent Jesus or some aspect of the person in the work of Christ what's interesting is you have Judah leading but you have these Furnishings which also speak of Christ and if you look at it they're in the middle they're in the very heart of the army they're protected all around them and I love that picture so the Ark of the Covenant was actually in the very in the very beginning the cloud lifted the very first thing that happened is they would take the Ark of the Covenant which in the Bible the Ark of the Covenant is called The Throne of God so the Lord", "Jesus if you will is leading by the way remember the Ark of the Covenant what's on top of the Ark of the Covenant what's that called The Mercy Seat why what's the significance of The Mercy Seat anybody somebody raise your hand what's the significance what happened on The Mercy Seat anybody remember one day one day a year something very important happened on The Mercy Seat the high priest did something what did he do something you have your hand up I can't see you guys come here Hobo Kelly glasses yes right here on Yom Kippur the day of atonement the day of covering the blood of the goat that had the sins of the nation confessed on it was shed and the high priest after other rituals were done for forgiveness of his own sins would go in representing the nation obviously Jesus is our high priest and he would sprinkle the blood of that animal that was taking the place shed for them on The Mercy Seat on the top of the Ark of the covenants why it's called The Mercy Seat and God's Wrath was averted as he would forgive the sins of the you see this is the place where if you will it's picturing that our sins will be covered by innocent folks The Mercy Seat is a type and a picture of Christ it is in the Greek the word for Mercy Seat is elasmus it's translated propitiation in first John 2. it is where our sins are covered so God's Wrath is not upon us and here's the thing that's neat when I think about it going out leading us if you will is The Mercy Seat the ark become which is a picture of the cross it's it's what happens and that's that's that that is I'm following my crucified savior who has forgiven me but another type and picture of the Lord Jesus and all those Furnishings is also right if you will in the heart of the nation and I love this picture the Lord leads us but he also lives a lot of people receive the Lord Jesus uh doctrinally I believe he died and rose again I I agree with I believe in one God the Father Almighty maker of heaven and Earth and one and they can recite the Creeds and they say I believe it's true and that's great it's important that you believe it's true but they receive Jesus as Lord in their heads someone has said the greatest distance in the world is the 18 inches between your head and your heart and there's some maybe even some here", "and you've never actually received the Lord Jesus into your heart say where do you get that job down Ephesians 3 verses 15 through 17. Paul's praying for the church at Ephesus he says that he the Lord would Grant you according to the riches of his glory to be strengthened with power through his spirit in the Inner Man so that Christ May dwell in your head oh no it's hard that Christ May dwell in your hearts through faith and that you being rooted and grounded in love might know what is the hope of his calling it's just a great passage and I I heard the story true story of a boy it was a little boy who had a heart he was a Christian had a Christian family and after he got the heart transplant he asked Mom do I need to ask Jesus to come now into this heart that's a cute story but my question is have you ever done that have you ever asked have you ever received Christ I don't mean just mentally agreeing with the doctrine but have you given your heart to the Lord because he wants to live in your heart yes he's going to lead you he's the Lord he's out front he's the head but he's right in the middle as well I love that but put this down number four see where in the family you are assigned or you can say called to be in verses 22-28 we have the list of the families the tribes of Israel by name there was somebody named who I can hardly pronounce who's in charge and they were they were they had Authority given to them over that army of that family by the way where you marched was not an option what do you feel like being today well I feel like being upfront no that's not going to happen um it was not an option it was an obligation if Asher said I want to lead today they would have been absolutely refused that was not their place they're not on a pleasure trip to see the scenery on the way to Canaan they're an army they're an invading uh they're invading enemy territory and they have a just like our armies you know I think so often if you if you listen to modern day soldiers if you ever watch a news thing where they're talking to people that are out in different places uh representing the United States you'll hear them talk about I have a job to do you ever heard them say that we're here to do a job", "they know exactly their part that they are to do there's a huge big picture that is bigger than their responsibility they're not involved with the big picture they're involved with a part of it and they want to be good at what they do so the whole park can have just like a football team you know you have a particular job if you don't do your job well it ain't gonna work the rest of it we need everybody doing their particular part just like Paul says we're a body and and and you aren't the whole body and we're not the whole body but we are to see that we have different roles to play and we must play through all God has put us into you've been put into a family just like these tribes you've been put into God's family and you're under God's Authority and as you're walking picture yourself I like this picture and you've heard me share it before you're marching in an army well that means there's some people that are probably ahead of you and there are some people right behind had you been placed where God wants you in the particular place because those people right ahead of you some of them have actually been where you're going there are people here that think of this what are you going through right now well I'm having real trouble with my boss well guess what you're not the first one if we just got the people who have ever had trouble with their bosses and watch the Lord work at it they'd be happy to sit down there are people that are walking ahead of you been through it and then there are some people you're not even thinking about but they're coming behind you and you're going through things right now that somebody else is going to need exactly they're going to want to learn from you you're you're you have a role to play right where you are and they're different by the way some of these people were called to be leaders those first three tribes were to lead not everybody's called the lead but by the way even those that are all called to lead we're also called to follow it's the Lord who's leading everybody the Lord is leading the leaders if you want to be a good leader and I hope you do because everybody in One sense is called to be a leader of some sort not necessarily to be a leader among God's people but you're called to lead a family perhaps or a friend", "for someone who's not as far along in the Lord if you want to be a good leader and I pray you say I do then become a Paul said imitate me as I imitate follow me as I follow the lord I used to think that was wow that's pretty good that you could say that I would never say I would never say imitate me as I imitate the Lord as like like I'm doing such a good that's not what he meant I I I it helped me to get this idea to whatever degree I imitate Jesus if it's one thousandth of one percent you know right there Bob stop right there you did it imitate me to the degree I imitate the Lord that's what's true for all of us but it means you're following Jesus he's got to be your leader and if you'll follow him Jesus said ah I'll make you more like me follow me and I'll make you Fishers of Men that's what I do well I fish for fish I'm really good at that yep you would like to fish for men I guess never done that before follow me I'll help you to become something you're not but you've got to follow me so some though were called in this case three tribes with Jude at the lead to lead the nation most of them were not called into that role they were called to fight they were called to serve and some one one group of three were at the very rear of the entire group they were the rear guard those are the peoples that are no one ever notices them they're in the back row and and but they're not just sitting in the back row because they're bored or they're slow or they couldn't they're in the back row because God has a purpose for them there and they have a unique responsibility to protect others you know when I was a police officer I I was uh out on the streets so my until I became a tech detective I I worked Patrol and most cops that's where you start but there was a whole division in the each of the police departments I worked for called Support Services those were not cops out on the street those were people that were doing things inside those are the people that they weren't all sworn officers even but they were working evidence and hiring new people and they were doing record checks and they were doing the radio we couldn't do our job except Support Services did their job there's no way", "and there are many Christians who who are called by the Lord into a support role in the body of Christ and they might be like well nobody even notices me you're wrong without your help those who are called Elite can't do their job will be and will be invaded and so it's important to say Lord I want to be where you've called me to be and I want to do in a way that glorifies you well put this down invite others to join us on this Grand verse 29 Moses said to hobab the son of ruelle the midianite that is Moses's father-in-law hey we're setting out to the place of which the Lord said I'll give it to you come with us we'll do you good for the Lord has promised good Israel he said I I don't want to go I'm I'm going home to my land and my relatives and mother said well please don't leave us and as much as you know where you should where we should camp in the wilderness and you will be as eyes for us now that's an interesting passage um and there's a principle for us put this down let people know that they're needed on this journey now let me just say there are some commentators who believe that Moses made a huge mistake here um they say this is ridiculous God is going to direct them God is going to lead them he's promised his presence Moses did not need his father-in-law's eyes or wisdom about where to park okay it's just uh that's just a defense to God and Uh I that is one opinion I I don't share it um so I hope you don't either uh even if javerin and McGee says it I don't agree with him on this particular passage I in part because there's no reproof of the Lord in it so I always hate it when people find flaws with people that God's word doesn't there's I could share a few sermons I've heard it's like wow what is that in the Bible it's coming from someone's mind and I love Jay Vernon God bless you richly my beloved he's amazing on this one I'm not with him and by the way not because of Spurgeon but I I agree with Spurgeon on this Spurgeon said that um we can learn from this invitation that this is his words that while we don't lean on our own understanding we don't ignore it either he said we'll always seek the Lord's guidance through Providence yet we may find direction and guidance through our", "own Common Sense our own discretion which God has given to us God will guide us supernaturally and sometimes he will guide us supernaturally naturally now those are my words sorry I'm mixing with spursions so you think they're spurgeons but I'm just not seriously we are told uh this is me we are told to seek wise counsel and there is safety in a multitude of counselors but then we know that the Lord is the wonderful counselor so all the wise counsel should align with the direction of the single wonderful counselor I agree I believe because the text doesn't say it was wrong that we shouldn't look at it this way and now I got to share with you some words that I didn't write because uh I wouldn't have written them this way but they're from John Corson and I think they're outstanding here's what he said to those who say they're not interested in church and don't care much about heaven we need to follow the example of Moses we need you I've seen the way you can hit a softball and our church team is desperate in desperate need of a first baseman you can help us you can enrich us or I've seen the way you work with people and we could use your abilities like a plus Fest or I've seen your artwork could you paint a mural in our Sunday school wing such is the course Moses took and hobab responded for in the Book of Judges chapter 4 verses 11 hobab's family appears again thus hobab did indeed choose to travel to the promised land when he was told you're valuable you can enrich us we need you are we really to tell unbelievers he needed the woman at the well to give him water to drink he needed the owner of the cult he'd that he had tied into in Jerusalem to release it to him how long has it been since you took someone by the hand looked him into the eye and said you need to be saved we're going to heaven if you don't come with us the alternative is awful and on the way we'll do you good it will be good for you to travel with us I know you feel more comfortable in the world but we need you in the Kingdom would you pray with me right now this is what God he says this he says maybe you've invited your unsafe brother-in-law or your nephew to church five Christmases in a row perfect timing John thanks only to have them decline every time but do", "you fully comprehend that they are going to hell unless they understand that God is prepared a land for them and that God places Great Value upon them that they can be helpful to the believing community and that will be good to them we can't let go we can't give up we can't stop the stakes are too high and then he quote C.S Lewis C.S Lewis was right when he said quote If Heaven and Hell are true Nothing Else Matters If Heaven and Hell aren't true then nothing matters at all he said I have found that the most effective way to bring people to Jesus is not by discussing Doctrine endlessly debating Evolution passionately or even inviting them to church repeatedly but to share with them the way of Salvation clearly and to pray with them immediately the church is a pilgrim people heading to heaven and we are to invite people to join us and enjoy the blessings along the way how many people have you invited I think this is a great example and I do believe that is a a proper interpretation by the way there are some conjecturies to this name here because we have met um Moses's father-in-law before what was his name then Jethro now Jethro is a hard name not for everybody but for those of us who have lived since the 60s because we picture a guy who graduated the sixth grade and is living in Beverly Hills nobody thought of that before The Beverly Hillbillies but they do now but Jethro is actually a title it's not a first name it means an esteemed one he was the priest a Midian and it's not his first name but we know him and we think of him uh by that name by the way it's not uncommon for people to have more than one name in the Bible we think of Moses and Moses that he's Moses that was not his given name by the way that was his name when he was taken out of the water by Pharaoh's daughter I took him out of the water so I named him Moses but I asked the rabbis you go online and ask her out at least 10 names Moses had at least 10 names by the way Solomon had another name anybody know Solomon's Jedediah which means look it up no I'm just kidding beloved of the Lord he had another name so it was not uncomfortable I have more than um with regard to Jethro which was a title his name is also ruelle ruelle means friend of God but his name was", "also hobab and just like some of you have how many of you have a nickname raise your hand but some don't want to share it okay it's good I'll never forget this should I tell that story it was a dispatcher who uh who called when I was a police I was a detective and called to the house or Becky had called him and she thought it was me on the other end of the line and I forget what did you bun or one or do or something and uh this guy anyway it wasn't me but some of us have nicknames that were known by that you know it's kind of a family so Ruel is one of Jethro's names hobab you know what it means it means cherished and what I want to suggest to you just speculation here is that I think Moses really liked his now think about because he's his father-in-law and his he's been watching his his father-in-law sheep for 40 years now I don't know how many been working for a boss for 40 years and we just love the guy but um he did and he respected remember he had already listened to his counsel about you know appointing people I mean he's gonna oh he's going to to say hey he respected him there's no question about it and he wants him to be saved and I love that this picture here of we need to let people know that we need them and I I do believe sometimes I mentioned the Sunday our first mission after we get saved is really to those closest to us in part because those are people who we know and we feel comfortable being honest with and who know us well enough to know we're being authentic going up to a complete stranger is very hard for most of us but for a new believer going up to your relatives who you know and love and who know you shouldn't be nearly as hard um Andrew meets Jesus who's the first person he leads to the Lord Peter and who's Peter right I mean his name was Simon but yeah first person he goes he doesn't get anybody else he just gets his brother you got to meet him I we you know and I love that or Nathaniel and Phillip same thing there's this friendship and kept come you know um so I kind of want to try to just take a moment here and ask you who's your hope AB what do you mean well maybe it's your I don't know I mean definitely not my", "maybe it is even Chef a family member or maybe it's a an in-law a sister-in-law brother-in-law a cousin maybe someone who's is blood related or related because of marriage after I got saved I was concerned for my family and some of you still have this concern or did when you got saved that your family was not saved because they weren't saved or they didn't seem like they were saved and sometimes when we're new in the Lord we have a lot of zeal uh to share the Lord and also a lot of judgment because we're immature in the Lord and so I had both of those so you know I didn't know much about witnessing clearly telling people you're going to hell isn't a good lead-in you know um so I so I gave up I was praying I prayed passionately for at least a day or two before I gave up as a young Christian I was 13 and uh decided well whatever and we we because it turned into more arguments than it did to anybody perceiving the Lord I was doing more damage you know so I gave up for a number of years I just I I didn't I stopped praying but the Lord brought that back and I started praying for my preaching to my family um just just praying for him and this is a true story it was about six months and and Lord it started being in a different relationship with him in terms of prayer and one of the things I did is I prayed for them by name every day at this time I wasn't married I was living at home with my mom and dad my mom and dad attended church but I didn't believe they were saved and I think they thought they were and I felt like that was part of the problem and a number of other youngest of five my brothers and sisters you know didn't go to church one was an atheist and the others were living in so I remember just praying Lord you got to do this work in them and and uh you know what happened during that time as I'm praying for them God started and instead of being judgmental toward him I just I just loved him and I wanted him to go to heaven you know I wanted him to be in heaven I wanted to go on the journey I want him to God I didn't the alternative was not acceptable to me but they seemed very comfortable right where they were and out of out of the blue really the", "Lord put it on their heart when I say their heart it was my mom and my dad uh who came to me because I was in Bible College at the time and they said hey Bob would you like to have a a family bible study and I thought excuse me I was like this can't be my mom because this is you know usually we just didn't we didn't have discussions like that anymore and I said a family bible study can I come she said no we want you to lead it I'm going me yes yes count me in and I I said is it just me you and Dad she said oh no she said I've already talked about it with your grandma and grandpa who never stepped one foot in a church their entire life they want to come one you're kidding thing that's a pure miracle I didn't say that I just thought and and uh and she said oh and your sister and your brother-in-law who live out in Riverside about a 45 minute drive they want to they want to come to and and your niece uh uh 12 year old 13 year old little girl uh uh Michelle wants my oldest niece wants to come they're all going to come and my my friend Lydia she's coming to I go I didn't know we had you know we need a bigger house already you know as we could hardly fit in the living room already before it started and so we did this family bible study and I I took them I think through Matthew and at the end of everyone there you know my family sitting around me I would just because that's I didn't know anything better I said well now if every eye is closed and and if anybody would like to receive Jesus into their heart just raise your hand and keep your eyes closed not mine the only one who could look around so I can say God bless you if you do no not today okay and so I would just do that every time you know and and I'll never forget the very first night my own sister uh received Christ and it was like why wow she I knew she went to church but she she came back the next week in fact my niece received price that first night too both of them and it was like wow this is amazing and so they came back and they shared my sister shared I went to church on Sunday but like the hymns were all brand new like I", "never sung them before and it was like oh this is so cool and then my mom recommitted her life I thought she needed to receive Christ I found out I was wrong and and and slowly but surely God started working in my family my grandfather for a year I kept hoping you know maybe he was awake at the end but not so sure but a few years later I got a call he was dying Saint Jude I'm sorry uh yeah Saint Jude up on her and uh to come say goodbye and so I went up and he literally was I mean he couldn't open his eyes he was in a lot of pain dying of cancer and uh but he could hear me and I I said Grandpa it's it's Bob Bobby and I said um I said are are you I was I didn't know what to say I said are you ready to die and he just shook his head no and I said I said you remember the Bible study that we did a couple years ago I said Remember at the end how I'd ask people if they wanted to pray that prayer to receive Christ I'd go Grandpa did you ever do that I said Grandpa which you want to do that with me right now my last words with my grandpa was introducing him to his Savior and the next time I see him he's going to teach me some things give me a tour but it would have never happened had I not invited him repeatedly to come along on a journey he wasn't ready to go on then about a year later I got a call from my brother-in-law he was Catholic he came with my sister every week and he wanted to teach the Bible study when are you going to stop letting us let us teach I thought okay let's try that and after doing it was I thought well I'm not sure what you were saying there but uh hope you enjoyed it anyway so but he his name was Jerry and he called me and uh I could tell he wasn't all that interested in in most of what I was saying I guess but about a year later he called me on the phone he said hey he said Remember The Family Bible study I go yeah he goes remember how you'd have people pray to receive Christ I go yeah he goes well I want to do it I go really I go well great well we should get together no no", "right now I go oh okay he goes I'm more down my knees go ahead like oh okay okay and so I prayed with him to receive Christ he said he's in heaven too with with my grandpa and most everybody other than two that were in that family study are now with the Lord but my point is this God wants to use you and he wants to use your hope Babs he does I don't care how long it's been since you've been a Christian what turmoil you've had with them he he puts you in people's lives where you care about them where taking no is not an option you know the fact that they're not ready they feel more comfortable where they are that's going to happen to just about every non-Christian who you're ever going to talk to but for you to say I need you to come we need you God's going to use you and I do believe that every unbeliever God has a purpose for their life in his family and you can say that by faith so I I agree with Spurgeon on this that this was the right thing to put the Lord first and he will direct your path in verse 33 thus they set out from the Mount of the Lord three days journey with the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord journeying in front of them for three days to seek out a resting place for them we have this principle through scripture you know Proverbs 3 5 and 6 you know this one trust the Lord with all your heart lead not on your own understanding and all your ways acknowledge Him and he'll direct your paths and the idea that if I'll put the Lord first in my life that Matthew 6 33 seek first the kingdom of God and his righteousness and all these things will be added to you I need to put the Lord out first he's ahead Psalm 23 verses 1 through 3. gives us this picture of the shepherd the Lord is my shepherd I shall not want. he makes me lie down in Green Pastures in other words he's directing me where I'm going to stop he leads me besides Quiet Waters he restores my soul he guides me in the paths of righteousness for his names sake this is really what I see here is the Lord is out front and he is deciding where we're going where I need to be where I need to go through and where I need to stop and that's the picture of the Christian Life you know there are", "in the in the gospels Jesus will say to his disciples come apart by yourselves and rest for a while we're busy it's time to take a break and uh he's always asking you know people to come find rest in himself uh sometimes you know I don't know about you I can be very lazy no nobody else okay me either really but sometimes I just you know don't feel like doing anything and then sometimes it's like when I get going now I don't want to stop you know what I hate is like when I start doing dishes which is like once a year I Thanksgiving that's my day I started doing the dishes and then somebody comes and says okay stop come be with us or come let's play I don't want him I really do want to finish I like this now I thought I hated it but I actually kind of enjoy it now but I certainly don't want to stop it in the middle because like if you had asked me before I started like no problem or but not now and so we have this problem sometimes right we can go either way the Lord sometimes is like he wants us follow me okay Lord I'm I'm with you and then they'll say okay time to take a break oh not now Lord where is where is engaged right Phillips up and Samaria the Lord says we need we have some other work to do are you kidding me we got revival going on here there's America I've never been a preacher before come on Philip I got us and if if we're sensitive to the Lord it won't always feel like the right time but it will be the right time because he and I I think there are times in your life in my life where the Lord says it's time for a rest and we go I'm not now you ever have the Lord take you aside and say yeah it is that accident you were just in that's this hospital visit you didn't plan on yeah you're suddenly dropping out of the units that you signed up for in college because you're not finishing the semester that's not my plan but I I have a lot of things to do Lord that you don't have anything to do you just need to come out of the coma I'm not kidding God will take you and stop you and you'll go I didn't uh yes sir yes sir he said this of himself in John 10 he the Good Shepherd goes ahead of his", "and he leads them out and they fall he goes ahead that's his role and here it's to provide a resting place for them he the shepherd does not turn around to the sheep and say what do you think are we going to vote how many of you would like to rest here you know just say good or just say something because I'm gonna we're gonna consent no he decides that's it okay that's it put this down don't forget to remember two things and we're done don't forget to remember the first one is as God's child your journey is always in verse 34. The Cloud of the Lord was over them by day when they set out from the camp now when I speak about being undercover first of all let's be clear what I'm when I was a police officer if somebody that meant they were in Disguise we had cops that looked like bikers smelled like bikers they fit right in to the biker community and we had cops that looked like high school that were going to be on campus selling drugs or catching people that did we had gang member cops we had druggies that looked like the part all to fit in all to infiltrate now now there are way too many Christians who go through life walking through life spiritually for the exact same reason they just want to fit in not actually to nail anybody for anything they just don't want to be called on the carpet no no this cover that I'm talking about covering and it's the way God's going to direct them he used the cloud remember to direct them to protect them and as a selection of where to stop so this covering is different I used to go out uh it seemed like once a week this this brother in the church he was older than me a businessman and successful and uh Nick I love the Lord and our church probably had 150 people in it but he was always there he was one of our ushers that loved being a church and he just decided uh I guess he wanted to bless me so I was still a cop and he would come by and say can I take you to lunch I said yeah sure so we we'd go out to Fiddler's three I think it's where we used Alta Vista and here he had one of the first mobile phones I created on the planet in his car like he would make the reservation as we were drives like wow this is cool and I was impressed you know", "anyway I think he waited to show me he could do but he he's just a friend and uh but we'd go out to eat and and you know first time he paid for it was very nice to him the second time I felt pretty guilty like wow it's my turn and at the end when the check would come he would grab it he'd say no no no please let me no because it's covered and I said well you know let me um let me just uh let me pay the tip he said no it's it's completely covered no matter what I said that was always his expression it's covered and I feel like as Believers it's hard to receive like that you know I didn't want it always to be that way but he did and I feel like the Lord when we feel ashamed of ourselves Lord I've I've really blown it again the Lord says it's covered your walk with me is constantly covered Lord let can I do no it's complete your forgiveness when we're frustrated and we don't we're disappointed and we're discouraged at the way things are working out the word says it's covered it's it's Romans 8 28. it's covering it's all covered right there it's in my policy it's working out together for good to worry your your entire Journey with me is covered and then finally put this down and we'll finish the worship team can come in his Rising is our victory in his return is our rest did you notice the last thing there in verse 35 and verse 36 look at it it came about when the ark set out Moses said rise up oh Lord let your enemies be scattered let those who hate you flee before you and when it came to rest he said return O Lord to the myriads of Israel very interesting the Lord's Rising is the basis of our victory and his returning is the basis of our rest think about that Jesus rose from the dead to deal with his enemy and ours thin death and the devil defeated that's Ephesians 1 18-21 the the victory over the enemy is the resurrection of the Moses prayed regularly for the Lord's return by the way he wrote Psalm 90 verse 13 which says do return O Lord how long will it be we need to get in the habit of praying Lord I want you to return you see this is to be we say thy kingdom come I love that I I do believe the Lord is saying to us listen your", "rest your Eternal rest and your rest in this life is for me come to me and I'll give you a rest now but ultimately the Bible says he who dies in the Lord blessed is he who dies in the Lord for he is he he rests from his labor and his deeds follow him this is what we're looking forward to doing Eternal rest doesn't mean Oblivion it means the rest that you long for in your soul to be in the presence of God he is our rest you know I just gotta you guys can stand pretend you're leaving um the the I'm convinced and I hope this doesn't offend anybody if it does I'm sorry but I I gotta say this I believe form of false advertising this world has ever known all over the world is on say what do you mean one of the most common thing to put on a headstone are rip which stands for it doesn't matter what they believed about God or about Jesus they're resting in peace that is not what my Bible teaches at all putting rest and peace on someone's headstone does not make them rest in peace the rest is in Christ for those who believe there is no rest for the wicked the Bible says and so but for the believer we have every Assurance we're going to heaven we don't have to wait to heaven to be resting in the Lord that's available now but we have eternal rest waiting for amen let's sing a song and standing against the power of", "relationship with you what your intention is in creating us Lord we have studied your creation of light and the luminaries in the sky and the sea we have seen that you made plants and animals Lord and just an amazing thing but no man was there to witness it not one single human being was there the Lord as we read now about the creation of the very species that we are we recognize that you're going to teach us things about us now we pray in Jesus name you give us eyes to see and ears to her heart to receive what you're going to say to the church in Jesus name Amen all right have a seat well we finally come to the end of chapter one we're not jetting through Genesis I know but that's okay the Bible can stand you're taking time with it because every word is inspired and frankly we miss all kinds of stuff along the way that you'll receive I'm sure and another study along the way but tonight we're going to talk about God's masterpiece the ultimate creation of God and God has been going from kind of progressing up to the climax of this particular work on the sixth day of the creation of man and so I at least the book of Genesis lays it out that way and he inspired it so put this down God loves you so he made you like him but in the word like verse 26 then God said some day six he's already created animals let us make man in our image put this down you were created and I was created to reflect God's nature now immediately in reading the text you your eyes are riveted on this fact that there's God speaking and yet he says let us make man in our image and of course the question comes up who's talking here who's talking to who there have been all kinds of answers about who that is and I can tell you those answers that come from Judaism and rabbis never deal with anything from the New Testament in terms of the nature of God and there's things like the Royal we you know I'm just myself that I represent the kingdom so a king would say we have decided this it's like we were you know you and who else just all me and my kingdom kind of thing so this this is a use within literature at times and so some have suggested that God is speaking about himself or someone said always talking about him in the only problem with that is Madison", "created in the image of the angels and the angels have nothing to do with creation according to the text or anywhere else so how long kind of falls flat really just about every other answer is a problem in terms of who God is talking to when he says let us make man in our image now we do know that God is one God is one by the way this is one of the most important basic truths within Judaism and that is taught in Deuteronomy 6 here o Israel the Lord is our God it's called the Shema or Shema we hold listen up Israel yo Jehovah is one God and unlike all the ancient religions of the world that believed in polytheism by the way atheism was unknown in the ancient world did you know that that we're not a theist running around that's a modern invention by the way did you know Christians were accused of being atheists and were arrested you say well why would Christians be accused of being a theist because they only had one God it wasn't enough there's thousands out there they should be worshiping they had denied the gods but anyway in the ancient world there were many gods and the belief in many gods pantheism polytheism etc but God revealed himself to Israel and to Moses really as the singular God here o Israel the Lord is our God the Lord is one and so as you as a believer in Jesus Christ come to understand the New Testament that it teaches us the Godhead is made of three persons that seems to sum to be polytheism or seems to be a contradiction to the truth that is clearly taught in the Bible that God is one by the way it is interesting there in Deuteronomy 6 the word that is used concerning God being one the word one is the word Ahad which there's different words for what in Hebrew and it means a unit a unity it is not a word that means the the numeral one he is one thing but he has unified is what it actually says and so it's an interesting thing that this and exactly what it means people will debate but we should at least recognize this the word God in Hebrew in the singular is L you're probably very familiar with that what you may not know is that in Hebrew there is both singular and plural but there's also something known as dual which we don't really have in the English language the best of my knowledge a word can be written in the", "dual form for instance the word Jerusalem is yerushalaim and Chulainn that ending speaks of the dual Jerusalem has as part of its name that it is - natured you say well why would Jerusalem have that be part of it well probably because there is a earthly Jerusalem and there is a heavenly Jerusalem them you see it's very clear in Scripture but in any case God is not here in the dual which would be - but he's in the plural which means more than - its Elohim and that word is then a word that speaks of God having a nature of at least three aspects now I love that God is speaking himself because it's not the only place this happens in the book of Genesis it happens three times by the way in the Old Testament once also in Isaiah 6 remember when Isaiah sees the Lord High and lifted up in the temple and the angels are crying holy holy holy and in Isaiah confesses his sin what was me I'm a man of unclean I told month the people of unclean lips and the angel the Seraphim touches his lips and and and cauterizes burns his lips and he's healed and forgiven and then God says who shall go for us who us and whom shall we send we have God again speaking in the plural tower Babel let us go down and see if these things are so it's very interesting to me that we find it a number of times in the Old I somebody shared this the other day I loved it you know trying to imitate Ellis trait God by the way is always going to fail some way or another and the reason it is is it should trying to illustrate the nature of God will always fail why because God is transcendent his nature is beyond our nature not only are his ways beyond our ways and his thoughts beyond our ways but Isaiah 40 God says to what then will you liken me saith the Lord in other words there's nothing out there there's not only not another God there's nothing that's a symbol - so when people say well God is kind of like an egg no there's the yolk there's the white and there's the show there you go God's be egg yeah but no that's a ways like water you know water can consider liquid it can be a gas it could be a solid so ya know there really isn't a perfect illustration of who God is and we shouldn't expect to find one he is", "unique and so we have to allow him to be so however I suppose the one of the best illustrations of that nature of God is the triangle a picture of something on there somebody has put together a triangle where there is the father who is not the Holy Spirit who is not the son who is not the father they are distinguished as separate persons in the Bible repeatedly even in the book of Genesis we saw the Spirit hovering on the waters from the very beginning the Spirit of God there but the triangle which is one thing if you will there's one God who consists in three persons and that's why we call it the Trinity or of God and of course man is made in the image of God now people have debated and will continue to what exactly is the image of God in man and at least we need to start by thanking God what a privilege because you didn't create anything else you know it's like man and the guppy or something else nope just you and me on this whole planet out of everything God's ever created bears the image of God even angels are not created in the image of God and so it's a pretty high privilege man is body soul and spirit of three aspects and we know that but we aren't three persons and so we can't push that too far how many of you have been to the Alamo in Texas okay remember the Alamo you may or may not have seen this but this is a fascinating let's put that other slide up guys this is one of the first pictures that you see on the tour of this in a very big museum there if you've been there but it's there James Butler Bonham that's the picture of James Butler bottom no picture of him exists I'm sorry that's not him that's not him James Butler Bonham no picture of him exists this portrait of his nephew Major James Bonham who's died he greatly resembled his uncle so his place here by the family that people may know the appearance of the man who died for freedom like we'd have picked him so here's a gothic tie well he he's gambling and he's got that you know same kind of chin or whatever and I love this because we are obviously not God I mean if I take a photo of Steve right now and show you the picture you go all that Steve well that's not Steve that's a picture of Steve do you matter that was really Steve hey Steve can't talk", "anymore no it's not Steve that's an image of Steve right woke Steve up anyway I'll work up from the rest anyway my point is this the image in our case is not actually God we're not God not little gods but there's aspects of how obvious Lee God's not the father is not a body he's spirit we have a spirit but we're not only spirit so the image of God is distinct from simply being a we are little gods no but we have aspects of who we are in the creation that are like thought enough that we bear His image his resemblance in some ways that God initially created now put this down one of the truths that flows right in conjunction with him creating us in His image realize you were created to reign you were created to reign and look at verse 26 again God said let us make man in our image according to our likeness and let them man kind rule that's the first thing says over the fish and the birds the cattle and over insects creeping things that creep on the earth jot down Psalm 8 verses 3 through 8 where David is going to focus on this truth he says this when I consider he's talking to God your heavens the sky outer space the work of your fingers which is the moon and the stars which you have ordained when I look at that all of the starry hosts and the and the planet what is man that you have thought of him and the son of man that you care for him in other words I'm so small compared to these things you've created that are so glorious you know yet you have made man a little lower than God and you crowned him with glory and majesty notice now you make him what sounds like David read Genesis you make him rule over the works of your hands and so it goes on not only sure where I when I stopped you have put all things under man's feet all sheep and oxen beasts of the field the birds of the air fish of the sea whatever passes through the pass of the sea so David is focusing on this text really when he's talking about the dignity and the glory that man has now it's important you realize you were created to rule now I hope that makes you hope you like that idea but don't go too far with it right now because while we are to lead and a different capacity lead people to Christ lead people that are younger than us", "leave their families this is talking about something much more significant than that you see as believers we don't behave in order to go to heaven I would say there are a lot of people who are trying to do that that will never work Bible that wasn't getting it that because they obeyed we did not behave want to go to heaven we behave because our names are already written in heaven jot down revelation 5:10 here's what it says God has done God has made us kings and priests to our God and we shall reign on the earth God says I'm going to make man in my image and first thing is he's going to rule over everything and mention there in Revelation 1 that is exactly what our future has for us there was a family who had a portrait of George Washington it was hanging in their home and his guy's name was Oliver shandler of Jim mess I don't know how to pronounce in Geneseo New York anyway he had this portrait of George Washington that that was hanging up in his house but they couldn't figure out why it was never ever like dusted it's been there for years and years and years here's what it said the family had always supposed the portrait was a common copy appraisers declared it however an original a Gilbert Stuart portrait worth around 300 thousand dollars it eventually sold at auction for nine hundred twenty-five thousand dollars and the writer says as we treat those things of great value with more care than those things we consider common and then it makes the application can we remember that every person is an original that God has made with great worth in the Lord's eyes the concept of the of every person being created in the image of God I don't care what they're wearing I don't care how they smell I don't care anything about any of that they're created in the image God so much so in Genesis 9 verse 6 by the way you need to turn there the basis for capital punishment that God gave to Noah the reason when a man sheds a man's blood his blood must be shed is tied to Genesis 1:26 because man was created in the image of God and God says that is an offense that is an attack on me it's not interesting that's how important it is to God and that's why God says when innocent blood is shed whether it's a baby in the womb or somebody else he he takes he will take that and make sure that justice comes is", "about he demands justice for the blood of the innocent did you know that because of the in it because of the image of God now put this down number three the image of God as described here is male and female verse 27 God created man in his own image and again now it's going to tie that to something in the image of God he created him but don't just think that's Adam because Adam really refers to Adam and Eve I know that gets confusing Adam we think of Adam as that was his name but the word Adam means man in Hebrew so when God made Adam he made male and female mankind is what he's talking about here he created male and female and so when he's talking about creating man in the image of God just put that down the image of God is male and female now angels which who we obviously are more powerful than us in the physical are not created male and female you may have seen female angels and pictures or paintings or cards but the Bible does not in any way suggest there's gender associated with angels now they can appear as men in Scripture they do but that doesn't mean they're male angels are nowhere called male or female nor do they propagate their kind they don't make more angels but man was given that responsibility and so we have gender here that is nature be propagated and his race continued I like what Matthew Henry said about this concerning man compared to the Angels he said fires and candles the luminaries this lower world has grown in and go out so they have power to light other lights not so with the lights of heaven stars don't Kindle stars Lord stars don't produce stars are produced by nebula and clouds and gauss's but it's very interesting making this analogy that God has decided that we human beings who are compared to angels we seem so fragile II see you know our lives aren't very long but in reality we're eternal beings but God has given us capacities they don't have put this down in terms of kind of a conclusion or an application give yourself to God who marked you as his as his own you don't have that one will make it up you can write it then don't write it down just do it write that sentence down if you don't mind give yourself to God who marked you as his own now here are some truths about being created in God's image it raises our dignity every human being as I said", "earlier it tells us this we are not the products of some galactic accidents nor are we the occupants of the top rung of an evolutionary ladder not according to the Bible because we're created in the image of God that unlike angels or animals in the scriptures we have a unique relationship to God we have minds we have emotions and we have will but listen also here's how I can distinguish us we have an inner spiritual nature that enables us to know God and in Nobel's us to worship God listened uniquely as those who have been redeemed by God's grace angels do not have that we are unique in that regard and while the image of God in man has been marred we'll get to that in Genesis 3 because of the fall of man through faith in Jesus Christ the Bible teaches through faith and price and early submission to the work of the Holy Spirit that that image of God can be restored and is being restored in every person this room who has a relationship with the Lord I love that Paradise Lost paradise restored now give yourself to those give yourself to God who mark to assist you remember when they came trying to test Jesus that was kind of a silly thing to do but I mean they went for sadducees tried the Pharisees tried they all had all kinds of final theological questions for Jesus and usually they just walked away deciding not to talk to him anymore because he pretty bad what our questions was is it lawful to pay taxes remember that one now we know and whether you like it or not and Bible is really clear we are commanded to pay taxes everyone else we don't like taxes we want to all go away every president that runs for office every person that runs for office is no more taxes right hated watch my lips doesn't usually work out that way the things going on right now that are going to raise taxes no matter what somebody says but the fact is the Bible talks about this that it's our responsibility as citizens to pay taxes to pay to appropriate taxes but when they ask Jesus the question was a trick because they knew that the people would hate him if he supported paying taxes to the Romans they were occupied and paying taxes they considered it offensive to do so that kind of like that's not honoring the Lord so they of course said no don't pay taxes than they could accuse him as being of treason which is ultimately", "what they did accuse him before before Pilate by the way but it's interesting to me Jesus he's so wise so is it lawful to pay taxes do you remember what he said give me a coin it Denarius and he simply asked a question what was the question whose likeness image inscription different translations he was on the coin and they said Caesar and Jesus said well then give to Caesar that was the Caesars of any of his images this is obviously they minted it give to Caesar that which is Caesars but that's not the important thing that he said that's about taxes it's the next thing he said don't miss it and render that King James give to God the things that are gods Oh what has God's image you know you know Jesus was saying this is irrelevant some guy men and some coins given back to me that's what they want but far more important issues that you give to God that which has the image of God stamped on it and the only thing you own that has the image of God stamped on it is you put you love it for it saying give yourself back to the one who made you put this down let it be God calls us to reproduce and to rule to reproduce into interval verse 28 God blessed them Adam and Eve and God said to them be fruitful and multiply very similar to what he said to thee to the fish and to the fowl be fruitful and multiply fill the earth and subdue it and rule over the fish and the birds and every living thing that moves on the earth but in the words reproduce and rule if I left that one out - and then I don't know but to put this down as a principle do the math we were made to multiply we were made to multiply now Bible teaches there in Psalm 127 children are a heritage or a gift of the Lord the fruit of the womb is his reward I love that the fruit of the womb is his reward now couples today I get to be with our young married couples so I hear the discussions that they're having most of them - haven't started their family a few of them started their families you know some are just getting pregnant and you know the couple shared that a couple of weeks ago we're excited for them but couples getting married today ask questions like this - of each other do you want to have kids how many do you", "want to have how soon do you want to start can I tell you something all those questions completely foreign any ancient Jewish man and woman they would have never asked those questions because those questions everybody knew do you want to have kids absolutely how soon as soon as possible how many do you want as many as possible in fact in the mind of the Jew to not be willing to have children was considered a sin because they thought they were diminishing something they wouldn't have told we're diminishing the image of God on the earth did you know that that's the way they looked at it the scripture doesn't say that that's that was their attitude such a blessing to have children who in the right line would not want them and there are plenty of grandparents who ask that about their kids who aren't ready to have children yet I I know that but remember in our text when God was creating that God created empty spaces so that he could fill them we talked about that God filled the empty space with the Sun the moon and the stars he filled the empty sky the heavens with the birds he filled the empty sea with fish in the empty land with animals and and and so now it's kinda like this God saying you know that I have filled empty spaces it's your turn I've created you in my image Beach you're going to do that be fruitful multiply fill the earth now there might be somebody in this room who said I never got married or I got married but I'm unable to have kids I will never have that blessing or have that fulfillment let me ask a question in scripture let's talk about two men who are some men who never had children raise your hand if you can think of a man who never had a child yeah Pete in the scripture in scripture Paul never had children that we know of anyway had a nephew but yeah Daniel who else did not had some yeah Simeon Samson John the Baptist Jesus now I wanted you to you could probably go on from there I wanted you guys to hear those names Paul the Apostle never had physical children would anybody suggest he was unfulfilled because he didn't have children Jesus never had children would anybody suggest he was not completely fulfilled by it because he didn't have physical children jot down first Corinthians four in verse 15 I don't know what Paul says to the church therefore if you were to have countless tutors in Christ yet you would", "not have many fathers for in Christ Jesus I became your what I became your father through the gospel he called Timothy his true son in the faith can I tell you something every single Christian can parent every single Christian can be used of God to fulfill this command spiritually to be fruitful and multiply and so if God has not called you to having physical children only well I've lost that blessing not so Jesus I'd accept a grain of wheat fall to the earth and die it remains alone but if it die it'll bear much fruit and I think sometimes we look at the physical we think all that blessing I didn't get that blessing listen that bless that physical blessing I'm not trying to minimize it it's wonderful but let me tell you something it is a picture it is an illustration in the physical of the greater spiritual blessing that's available to every person in this room but do you believe it or not God has designed you to be fruitful and multiply it's not physically definitely spiritually how do we multiply well it's really clear in Acts chapter 6 the Word of God it says increased and the number of disciples multiplied when the word was shared that's how the Word of God as it comes into our life and through our life then God's multiplication can happen as people come to know Christ put this down God calls man to take charge over the beastly nature verse 28 he says not only fill the earth but subdue it now this is interesting to me it almost sounds like there's a war gonna go on subdue it well there's no sin in the world yet but the animals need subduing you know now James says every manner of animal has been what is the wildest most exotic animal anybody in here has ever seen came you ever seen that was it you couldn't believe it but there was one of there was obtained one of those anybody raise your hand so I know a snake like a you know when they played this what is that thing that's nothing let's say a fight just look a little well you know in India okay Python what else Otto Stan yeah I'm bear so okay maybe the circus it got to be careful on those huh especially if you're an illusionist in Las Vegas yes a platypus tame platypus you mean I didn't this was somebody's pet Wow so so James says every manner of animal has been tamed in James day and it's been two couple thousand years", "since then of taymiyah so there's no animal that can't be relatively tamed he goes on to talk about the part of the body that can't be tamed which is what they're told it's right inside your about UK control it he calls it a restless evil full of poison set on fire by Hell itself and no man contained the tongue but this idea of the taming of really the animals that God had created it's interesting to me that God would have man have this challenge you know before I sometimes Christians think you know I can't wait to go to heaven because I could don't have to work anymore what can I ask you did did Adam have a job before he sinned what was his job naming the animals tending the garden to go home now I'll never get out of gardening the rest of my eternity listen work is not evil because of sin work is vanity much work is vanity not all work your work is not what your toil is not in vain in the Lord but thorns and thistles it shall yield for you that's no gardener wants to hear that it's going to be in sweat that you're going to eat you're gonna it's going to be a lot harder than it needed to be God added an element of waste that comes with work so you feel like what's the point not getting anywhere that's the result of sin work itself is noble six days thou shalt labor by the way it always amazes to be able to share with somebody about the Sabbath they were asking me you know how come you know Christians don't honor the Sabbath we just they said Sunday I'm thinking well let's start with the fact that it's never been Sunday and it never will be Sunday biblically it's not fact that Christians worshiped outside you had to do with the resurrection had nothing to do with the Sabbath but besides that it basically how many people want to do no work on Sunday or on Saturday even who don't obey the command fully in the ten commandments which says six days you shall labor so whenever somebody's telling me why don't you rest on Saturday I asked them why don't you work the rest of week because God anyway off-target let's go back to where we were talking about I'm sure what we're talking about but I got into that okay put this down well you already did think about this God tells man I want you to rule over these three areas of the fish", "the fowl and the animals you know Jesus demonstrated that you ever thought about that Jesus demonstrated his authority over fish bhindi when he said hey throw the net on that side Peter right now I don't you fished all night but what's this right or go down and take your pole I know we need to pay the tax so go down we'll take care of it handy to have Jesus around isn't it especially at tax time it was pretty cool and how about when Peter denied the Lord what happened what Jesus had said before the crow he sends his sovereign team not just as for knowledge but his sovereign control how about the beasts did he not ride the donkey the donkey that had never been ridden before into Jerusalem does Mark one not say that when he was out in the wilderness he was also with the wild East's yet Jesus demonstrated his own authority his rule over these three spheres but we are called humanely to be engaged in this challenge of what as part of God's creation it's part of his desire that we would take charge over that but I also see in this an interesting thing man is not given sovereignty over the Sun or the moon or the Stars but over living things in the now this teaches us at least this there are some things beyond our control but there are some things within our god-given sphere of control do you remember what the Lord said to Cain it says Cain became angry and upset let me ask you why did Cain get upset why was keen to press raise your hand if you remember why he was upset who remembers over there why was he upset because God wanted to instead it was just hit but it was that jealousy thing you know and so he became despondent and angry it's very interesting when we think still go our way we can get depressed and we can get angry by the way those two sinned and those two emotions are very much tied to each other I I don't know if you've noticed that that pain emotional or physical can get tied to anger right guy it says some what does he go oh my soul oh it's bad where's anger come from pain well they're related and so King gets angry and depressed and God comes to how gracious is that Cain it's sin that's why he's in the condition he's in but God comes to him and says came why are you angry I've got or he knows sonica", "can't figure this out why are you angry and why has your countenance fallen note that means your face is droopy you've got a sad face why are you angry and why is your countenance fallen and then God even gives them the prescription of what to do to change it I love it it says if you do well well not your countenance be listed up but if you do not do well sin is crouching at the door what and its desire is for you but you must master it very interesting sin God says is like a an animal that sees you as prey that can take you down if you're not careful you don't deal with it and he did not we know Cain went down because of his sin chose to go out and kill his brother interesting God's telling man I want you to be over those animals that have that beastly nature so sin is pictured as that animal that has to be subdued of course we can't do that except by the Holy Spirit Paul says in Romans 8 but if by the spirit we put to death the deeds of the body will live Spirit of God can give you the ability over your flesh you don't have it what who contained the tongue no man but that doesn't mean no God God contain your tongue look at acts 2 Spirit of God distributed himself as tongues of fire you can have your tongue set on fire by hell or heaven who's got your tongue remember that's the big question and so Paul says there in Corinthians I buff it my body and I make it my slave lest after having preached to others i myself should be a castaway in other words I have a responsibility before the Lord yes there's nothing good that dwells in my flesh and if I allow it that fleshly nature's like a beast God says but he's selling man you've got to subdue that I think it's fascinating analogy anyway put this down or see God sustains and appraises all that he makes sustains and appraises verse 29 then God said behold I have given you every plants yielding seed that is on the surface of all the earth and every tree which has fruit yielding seed it shall be food for you and every vegan said Amen if you just want to live in Genesis beast of the earth and every bird of the sky and everything that moves on the earth which is life I have given every green plant for food food and it was so and God saw all that", "he had made now it's not just day six but day one through six now he's looking back and behold it was told in the Hebrew who is very good and there was evening there was morning the sixth day we'll put this down since God made you you need to trust he will meet your needs so God makes man but he also makes food for man in its ample but you jot down some 36 and verse 6 God your righteousness is like the mountains or rather your righteousness is like the mountains of God your judgments are like a great Depot Lord you preserve man and beast psalms talks much about this God you feed the animals you provide for the animals and you therefore will provide for me we have a bird feeder in our bag how do you have bird feeders ok I say we because my wife has one so I can claim I I don't ever fill it I'll be honest with you I'm not proud of that actually about the herald no I mean I do once in a while when she says will you feed the birds so I do it but um you know we buy bird food and she almost every morning will say oh I've gotta go feed my birdies and I'll say God feeds the birds and she'll say I know he uses me so yep she's right kid no argument there yeah least at my house God takes care of what he creates shut down Matthew 6 and verse 26 look at the birds of the air that they do not sow nor do they reap or gather into barns and yet Jesus says your heavenly Father feeds them and then the conclusion that he's tried to get you you know that already are you not worth much more than they if glad feeds the birds that you don't even give a second thought to then why would you worry about the things you need that clearly the ideas you really don't understand the nature of God when you worry about provision you don't really trust him he made you yeah but I was gonna leave me to starve no he's not he may not feed you the way you want to be saying you know Jesus said we're to pray give us this day our daily bread remember girls as they are getting filet mignon well you can pray that all you want but the prayer the word pray life was a little simpler my god shall supply all your needs not my God shall supply all your greens this is a four it that", "way but God's going to take care here so the Shepherd that becomes the sheep says the Lord is my shepherd so I don't really need anything I'm doing good I like the story written there was a Christian lady who lived next door to an atheist maybe you live next door denied a pious everyday when the lady prayed the Atheist guy could hear her he thought to himself she's nuts praying all the time like that doesn't she know there isn't a God many times while she was praying he would go to her house on her ass for saying lady why do you pray all the time don't you know there's no God she kept on praying now one day she ran out of groceries and as usual she was praying to the Lord explaining her situation thanking him for what he was going to do and as usual the atheist heard her praying and thought to himself I'm gonna fix her this time he went to the grocery store bought a whole bunch of groceries took them to her house dropped them off from the front porch rang the doorbell and hid in the bushes to see what she would do when she opened the door she saw the groceries and began to praise the Lord with all of her heart jumping and singing and shouting everywhere the atheist jumped out of the bushes and told her you all crazy lady God didn't get those groceries for you I bought those groceries then she broke out and started running down the street shouting and praising the Lord when he finally caught her he asked what her problem was she said I knew the Lord would provide me with some groceries but I didn't know he was going to make the devil pay for them or to realize that you're me my need is an invitation to trust God it's an opportunity for God to reveal to us again and again and again you know what did David say I I was young and um old but I've never seen the right just begging for bread or his seed disregarded neglected oh just hasn't happened you know Lord takes care of his own puts this book that done God gives us an example to review and to evaluate and it's his own example after each day save the second God reviews his work each day he says at the end of the day it is good it is good Tok Tok Tok it is good you can't like give himself a self-report card that was good you know", "um and then of course at the end of the the creation week the end of God's work he said it's it's very good Isaac Watts tend to him called I sing the mighty power of God and in that second verse it says I sing the goodness of the Lord who filled the earth with food who formed the creatures through his word and then pronounced them good Lord how thy wonders are displayed where ere I turned my eye if I survey the ground I tread or gaze upon the sky in other words all around us we're seeing the goodness of God the faithfulness of God that is to remind us that God is that way but notice the Lord does this at the end of every day he looks back and he evaluates his work that should teach us at the end of our day getting ready for bed whatever later should think back how'd it go now won't always be what God said I know that but we should look at it we should review and evaluate it at the end of a week God's here at the end of a six days now getting ready for the Sabbath rest the work week done take some time look back on the week evaluated and assess it and when you come to the end of your life when your work is done on this earth you want to be able to look back and evaluate it and your prayers Lord I want to be able to say it was very good but you know Lord I don't trust my own judgment remember how Paul said I don't know of anything against myself but I am NOT thereby acquitted for I do not judge myself I'm judged by the Lord and so Lord you're gonna have to search me and try my heart I can't bail out Satan Paul I'll praise the Lord build stop there say God you see it all you try the hearts in the range you try the innermost man you know the truth there's wickedness and me if I'm not aware of it what I want to see it I want to deal with it but it's good for us to look back review and assess like the Lord does and then ultimately like God does at the end you wanted you know basically what he was done with this creation it's kind of like you said to himself well done that something there that's what you and I want to hear see God is at work in you too willing to do his good you are the workmanship of God Ephesians", "2 that he made you fearfully and wonderfully in your creation in your body and now your life is God at work in you and through you that at the end you want to hear him say what he said at the end of the week well done but it's really about what he did in you and through you so four things and we're going to go back to worship put these give yourself wholly to God why because you're creating in them and put in the word consecration do you have four films at the end hallelujah put in the word consecration this passage teaches us that we must dedicate ourselves to God because we're made in His image reproduce the life that God gave put in the word multiplication here we're talking about spiritually now every one of us can fulfill that reproduce the life that God gave you as a Christian multiplication thirdly answer God's order to rule sanctification Lord I want to have victory over the peace that lies no answer gods ordered to rule sanctification and finally live for God's final approval and that's glorification that's the day when I'll stand before the Lord he'll assess my life he'll review my life and my priorities he can say well done thou good and faithful servant enter into the joy of your master so let's pray Lord get us ready now to sing praise worship to You Lord would you open our hearts that it doesn't just come from our mind Lord it has been a long day we need refreshing and so I pray that your spirit would touch us I pray that you would allow your word to kind of simmer in our hearts and that you would give us application Lord if we have an area of our life that really isn't dedicated to you it's it's being run by us and we're making a mess of it help us to give that to you or back to you Lord if there's a some animal that is making us pray and like Cain we're not listening to your word Lord we want to repent of that we are wanting father your word to change us right now so as we sing and worship and exalt you hear our worship meet us in this place in Jesus name Amen", "I will curse and in you all the families of the earth will be blessed let's pray father this covenant this hauling of Abraham really is so profound that we need to take time to consider the promises you've made and the promises you've kept not just to Abraham but Lord as Abraham is a prototype he is our Father in the faith and all who believe you say in your word Lord would you teach us about your promises and about walking by faith teach us what it means and help us to grow in it tonight in Jesus name amen you can be seated so let me just ask you at the beginning of our study tonight when you hear that phrase to walk by faith what does that mean to walk by faith help us with that I mean you know I'm a human stood I think rightly so sometimes I'm using Christianese I'm so used to it I speak to Christians from the Bible and sometimes you know my son will say dad people don't understand who come in who don't know the Lord and I'm thinking yeah they're probably you're probably right they don't and I don't want to make that mistake I want to learn to be a little clearer but let's make sure we all understand just what does that mean to you that when I use that phrase to walk by faith what does that mean to walk by faith joint okay to stand on his promises yes don't have to know all the answers you don't have to know what's gonna happen you just have to know him yes so he's trustworthy so to walk by faith actually you know when you think about it we I do this too I tend to use words that are part of the phrase in my description of it you know I always hate definitions that use the word they're defining I think that's a violation but we do that well you know it means this or that and to walk by faith you know I remember using the expression with somebody who didn't know the Lord yeah since I've been walking with the Lord and they go what do you mean by that I said what walking with the Lord it's like like they pictured me out walking hand-in-hand with Jesus somewhere or something they didn't make no sense to them at all we do i do use phrases that i need to define so to what first of all what does it mean to walk to live okay so to walk means to live let's make sure", "if you didn't know it before now you do it means really everything to do your your activity as a human being in the Bible is called our walk are our manner of life and to walk by faith involves everything we've said in more Richard you were gonna add to it so trusting more than yourself yes say again live your life in obedience Kim to believe God and trust him to know that his plans are for you Jeremiah 29:11 yeah yeah forward movement okay came out leaning on your own understanding and your natural senses so I think we we've got we've kind of got it let me ask you this since you guys are the Bible students you're the ones here on Wednesday nights you are you are the ones who are committed students to be here what's the context we walk by faith not by sight somebody's looking it up right now you're disqualified yes Hey Holies okay the leading in the Holy Spirit yeah okay moving forward context context context of we walk by faith not by sight first of all what book is that from don't say the Bible or you're in trouble with me good okay so second Corinthians and in 5/7 and the context the 2nd Corinthians 5 is okay we have these bodies Paul says they're like tents they're temporary dwelling places that in them we groan because we want to be immortal we want to be got with God we know that while we're in these bodies were absent from the Lord and to be absent from the Lord is present and body but to be absent from the body is to be present with the Lord he says for we walk by faith not by sight the context has to do with death did you know that we apply to everything but in context Paul is talking about the fact that we live this life knowing that there's more than this life listen I just came this afternoon from a local hospital essential in the hospital where I I spent a little time with an 84 year old dear friend of mine who's who loves Jesus and she's been in our church for I don't know 30 years I did her husband's funeral 20 years ago who I've known them since I was a teenager and Jane Hendricks I think I don't know maybe tonight maybe tomorrow is gonna be in heaven unless Lord chooses to do otherwise I've always felt like when I go to visit a believer at a hospital I always think this is I Drive in you know hospitals for Christians", "should have another sign kinda like when you go to LAX you know it says arrivals and departures either I think hospitals should have that arrivals and departures there there are people that are coming into this world and for their people are leaving yeah that's where she's gonna go maybe that's what gonna be her launch pad is that ICU that I just saw her in and yet when we gathered around her and some of the believers who are here tonight and my family were there just a joy as we consider the fact that we're not yeah we're gonna miss her but we're gonna see her again Christians never say goodbye for the last time she knows that when this body is done and it looks like baby it is she's going to be with Jesus she knows that she's been living we've had lots of conversations for decades about that and she can't wait and although I don't want her to go I do want her to go and that's the contest by the way we walk by faith not by sight it's not just about everything else it's about life and death it's about the most important issues of life but it involves everything you guys said as well that we don't just look at what we see as believers we live differently in light of the promises of God and the invisible things which according to second Corinthians are the eternal things right okay now we're gonna read tonight and study tonight a very important change in the book of Genesis I'm meaning this we've been studying for the first eleven chapters about 2,000 years of history but it really is the preface of the story we have now gotten very quickly by the way from Noah down to the birth of Abram and 25 percent of this book um pardon me 25 chapters of this book Korean about Abraham and his descendants now and so we're really where the holy spirit wants to go and introducing this man Abram and we've we've taken a lot of time to get there because we've gone slowly through the first 11 chapters but this woman God introduced himself to Abraham and if you think about it where we've gone so far is God has been very patient with a very rebellious people so far we've seen the fall in the garden right the first man and woman they blew it remember we said it was a test but it was Adam bombed it was the first atom bomb right he blew the test and and so would we have he was our best and he", "blew it and then Cain kills Abel that was not a good follow-up to that first story and then after that we see the wickedness of man that's growing as man's populating the earth he's like he's just filling the world with evil until God finally has to take all of mankind out again I mean it was bad enough not only was Cain killing Abel then you have Lamech who's even worse prideful then you have the wickedness of mankind God wipes out the earth and starts over with a brand-new family Noah and his family only it's right after the flood Noah's getting drunk and naked and it's like oh my well this was our best guy and oh we're in trouble again and then you have Nimrod who's just a Nimrod and his whole thing with Babel in rebellion to God and God has to come down and destroy Babel and it seems like he's just one thing after and it was George Bernard Shaw who once said if there are aliens that inhabit the other planets or if there's aliens that didn't have in other places in the universe they probably use the the earth as their insane asylum in other words uh things are weird here things are out of control here and I mean with that's true now and as you read the Bible things are bad and and yet God is not giving up on man as you would think he'd get frustrated instead we now find in starting chapter 12 how God's plan to fulfill his promise back in genesis 3:15 to redeem fallen man is gonna start working out he's gonna start with a man it's always where he starts with a man so put this down we're gonna see in the call of God that he's calling him and really us to to leave it all behind if you're gonna follow the Lord you're gonna have to leave it all put in the word all behind now the Lord said to Abram go forth from your country your relatives from your father's house to the land that I will show you we have nothing in the Bible that suggests Abram chose God nothing we only have evidence that God chose Abram and by the way that's always the case remember that's what Jesus said to his disciples you didn't choose me I chose you and I just always remind myself that there's anything in me or anyone else that's seeking Lord it's a result of God's grace in our life we wouldn't even be seeking Him so God's not the responder God is the initiator the Bible says he's", "the author and the perfecter of faith but this down salvation involves a call to separation salvation always involves a call put in the word separation and jot down Joshua 24 and verse to Joshua 24 verse 2 Joshua said to all the people thus says the Lord the God of Israel from ancient times your fathers lived beyond the river east or mouth Euphrates many names who their fathers were Tara we should recognize that name the father of Abraham and the father of the snorer neighbor and they that's what his name means and they served what other gods we are told here in joshua 24:2 very clearly abram was an idolaters before god introduced himself they worshiped their inner of the cal d's at that time the moon god named ninh r and interesting to me that God in His called Abram Abram is the father of all who believe the Bible says so he's a picture for all of us of our own walk with the Lord or at least he should be remember what God told the Israelites on the night he would save them out of Egypt we call that the Passover right the Angel of Death would pass over those homes that had taken the blood of the Lamb and put it on the doorpost the lintel of of their of their homes and as the Angel of Death would come he'd strike death into the home of every Egyptian home or anyone that didn't have the blood on the but for those Israelites who believed God's promise and obeyed God's Word there was salvation so the night of the Passover but it wasn't just this night of God judging Egypt it was also the night whereby he would change Pharaoh's heart and so God told his people on the night of their salvation how they were to eat the Passover does anybody remember what they were to wear when they ate the Passover what was the Passover we're whole line of clothing anybody remember no yes yeah had to eat it standing up did you know that you weren't supposed to sit down yeah how do you even standing up you had that you have your sandals on and you had to have your walking stick why you ate why because you're leaving I'm saving you tonight and by the way when God saves he separates he always calls to separation that's why when you read about don't be unequally yoked with unbelievers which usually means don't marry a non-christian not only says it includes that it's much bigger than that they're in 2nd Corinthians 6:14 don't be", "unequally yoked with unbelievers for what partnership is light with darkness what does a believer having come with an unbeliever for God himself had said come out from their midst and be separate want a relationship with God I do he says then you're gonna have to separate yourself and we see this right at the beginning in Abraham's life God's calling him to leave the life that he has known before that so you might say this faith always is a call to relocate spiritually always and it's interesting he's not just called to leave his country but he's called to leave his friends and his family that he has been a part of by the way this is why some people really struggle or fail in their relationship with the Lord right here they're not willing to leave something God is calling them to leave jot down Matthew 10 and verse 37 he who loves father or mother more than me Jesus said is not worthy of me he who loves son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me things and people can get in the way of our relationship in our love for the Lord and certainly in the way of following him the way we're supposed to follow remember the man who came to Jesus and said I will follow you but first let me what was it bury my dad now we should yeah go take care of the funeral Jesus didn't say that what did he say let the dead bury the dead it's like I don't even know how that would happen but I'd like to see the video I mean I just not sure when she was talking about the spiritually dead take care of that business but you come follow me his dad wasn't even dead yet that was a phrase to use someday dad my dad's gonna die I have this allegiance to my family is what he was talking about and Jesus saying you're not ready you're not you need to count the cost of following me there will be a cost and it will cost you many times relationships shut down Psalm 45 verses 10 and 11 I think this is a good verse that describes the Bride of Christ the pall on the bride just like in the Song of Solomon but here in some 45 listen o daughter give attention and incline your ear forget your people and your father's house then the King will desire your beauty because he is your Lord bow down to him it's the same idea there needs to be a willingness to separate you know", "for some people it's a boyfriend or it's a girlfriend or a best friend or a husband or a wife that can get in the way of your relationship with the Lord why did Adam eat the forbidden fruit he wasn't tricked into anything he did it willingly for Eve I guess right why was it God almost killed Moses before he even got to Pharaoh right after he gave him the Commission to go and say I love my people go and he accepted the committee why did God almost kill him while he was on the way unwilling evidently to circumcise his son it didn't appear that mrs. moe was voting for that you have made me a you know bloody bride you're a husband of the sir yeah she evidently opposed what God was telling him to do and he at least for a period of time was willing to compromise well it's easy we don't even see when we're doing it when we're compromising our relationship with the Lord put this down let her be God promises blessings beyond belief and here in our text we're gonna find out that there are actually seven in this original calling of Abraham seven promises number one God promises to lead a believer somewhere new somewhere new in our text he tells him very specifically that he will take them to a nother land that they had not seen so we know Abram is going to go from his country to a land he said that he would show them in other words I'm gonna take you someplace you've never been when you become a Christian yours you're in the same way the Lord saying I'm gonna take you somewhere you've never been I don't care if you've grown up in church I don't care how many seventy school classes you attended this is not about knowledge this is about an adventure that I'm taking you on a personal one and you know someone said it this way we aren't saved by making promises to God we're saved by believing God's promises to us I like that that's exactly right faith is is believing the promises that God has made to us and salvation while it includes moving away from sin and if need be sinners the separation it's more than just moving away from sin it's actually moving in obedience to what God has promised and what he's what he's commanded like someone said earlier I see in Jesus's ministry kind of two words he used commonly for his altar do you remember what they were two words follow me follow me how was his", "invitation follow me follow me and I I see that same thing here with the Lord but Jesus she was following me jot down Matthew 4 and verse 19 he said follow me that's the invitation but here's the promise I'll make you fishers of men I'll make you something that you're not now we're told when he said that to Peter James and John they immediately abandoned their boats they were fishermen they left their nets and their father left it all behind and they they followed Jesus you know police work is not for most police departments like it is when you watch him on TV by the way neither is working in an ER in a hospital we know that right I mean if it was exactly the way real life was the ratings won't be quite as good as they can be when it's nonstop action but growing up watching police work and cop shows on TV I thought it was till I went on ride-alongs and said where's all the robberies and the gangs with the chains and knives and you know all the action that I saw rolling code 3 everywhere and and I'll never forget one of my training officers said to me said you know he said police work for the most part is kind of routine you'd do the same things over him you drive the same streets you take reports after the fact even somebody broke into some business or some car got broken into or car got stolen or you know somebody hit somebody it's all after the fact and you're just recording it in case they can prosecute it your jobs not usually to investigate it he said so for a lot of the time for most cops it's about 95 percent routine he said it's maybe about 3% excitement and it's about 2% sheer terror and I think that's a pretty good description if a lot of the police work that I did a lot of routine just kind of ordinary kind of going you know through the same things over and over again and and it's funny when I left law enforcement to become a pastor I had a lot of people say don't you miss that like you're a pastor now and you used to be a cop you know it's like oh no no III believe me that was way more boring than my job is now wait this is way more exciting this connectivism if you think the Christian life is boring it's pretty obvious to me you're not following Jesus let me say that again if you are of the", "opinion the Christian life is boring would you please go back and read about following Jesus and the Gospels and the kind of things that happened when people follow Jesus or for that matter just think of the children of Israel in the wilderness how did God lead the children of Israel through the wilderness do you remember what it was was a pillar of cloud by - a pillar of fire so they could see right and night and here's what it says they just had to go where the pillar went and so if the pillars stopped it like okay hey wait hold on we're stopping how long I don't know right now okay it's well we Mazel gets the sun's going down we might as kids put the tents out yeah still there sometimes one day sometimes a year it says you just never knew you didn't know if we're moving quick let's go break what movin every day was like that for the children of Israel you never knew you had to be ready to go I like with the staff and yeah kinda that's the is walking by faith means you do not know how your day is gonna end not just cuz you live on planet Earth but because you're following the career of the earth and your Lord it's a different kind of a thing altogether and so Jesus says follow me you know no one says follow me to you unless they're going somewhere you can't get you unless you follow them why follow just why they beat me down it you know he knows well I don't want to get thrown the follow you but if you tell me meet me at slobo vias that I've never been there I don't have to follow you there or give me the address or something put this down God promises to grow the believer by faith he says go forth from your country your relatives your father's house to the land I'll show you I will make you a great nation but in the word grow I will make you a great nation anything about could there have been anything farther from reality at the time that God said it I mean how many people are in Abraham's family right now well I guess it'd just be the two of them just the two of us like the song says write great nation I don't think so he is 75 years old he did not have any children and did look like was good prospects for that his wife is 65 haven't had any kids they wanted kids but they're barren he's not", "a great nation he's a great nothing probably now you know I mean it's not like it's gonna here's the thing God says I'm gonna make you a great nation and yet there's no evidence a that that's true now or ever going to be that way that's what it means to walk by faith is you take the promises of God they don't make sense to you but you say hey if God said it I believe it and I'm gonna operate on the basis of that faith makes people say what maybe I don't know maybe the Dodgers are saying the Dodger fans are saying right this moment what Yogi Berra said they would over till it's over I don't know the world's early this is gonna end but Abram is being told by God here in seventy I'm gonna give you a few kids I'm gonna give you one kid I'm gonna make you a great nation now that's very interesting to me the Bible says in Romans in hope against hope he believed God's Word jot down Isaiah 51 and verse 2 God says there look to Abraham your father and to Sarah who gave you birth to you in pain when he was but one I called him that doesn't mean God called him when he was 1 year old it means he called him when he was just one man then I blessed him and I multiplied him what does that mean for you and me if you and I are to walk like Abraham walked in faith it means that you accept that your story is not over yet even if you like well it doesn't look like God will ever use me in any great way or way to honor him or I just think it looks like my life's gonna turn out this way don't say that it ain't over till it's over what if like Abraham for you your story is just beginning right now he's 75 some of you feel like I'm getting old and on in life and gods no he just he is just who knows what God might still want to do with your life now number three is missing from your outline and I'm to blame so I'll give it to you you'll have to actually write all these words in God promises to bless us personally it doesn't matter what the filling is because they're all being filled in God promises to bless us personally he says there I this is at the end of verse 2 I will bless you now let me ask what does", "it mean when God says I will bless you if you're blessed by God what is that we use that word all the time I'm so blessed may God bless you you know what does it mean yes God honors you okay what does it mean to be blessed of God yes to show favor I like that anybody else yeah he has you covered okay anything else blessed more than you ask her think oh I'm liking this let's keep going here nobody else does it mean are you blessed and you go I don't know what the definition is I hope so yeah okay receiving something you don't deserve well that's - yes it means happy it it absolutely does now in the Old Testament the term in Hebrew is Barack take that up with the Lord I didn't create the Hebrew language and it means to bow down it's about an inferior bowing before a superior but in the New Testament there in Matthew 5 we have what we call the Beatitudes where we have nine different times Jesus shares who is blessed and that word macarius air in in greek means to be happy happy are the poor in spirit for theirs is the kingdom of God we're happy are those who mourn for they shall be comforted but it's it's the word blessing and I think that's very interested times especially as preachers talk about you know happiness versus joy and I think there's even sometimes some attitudes that I'm not sure very biblical among some Christians like well I don't want to be happy I just want joy yeah need that happiness stuff I don't know the Bible says happy are the people whose God is so I'll take both if they're available you think about the Declaration of Independence guarantees you the right is an American well really says God gives it to you in alienable rights - life liberty on the yeah as American you have the right to pursue happiness but absolutely no guarantee you're ever gonna get it at all just you go pursue it maybe but here Abraham in the blessing of God is is promised that he would be blessed and in our walk with the Lord we have this confidence Lord I don't know what's gonna happen see here says the person who's walking by famous as them stressing in the world you will have tribulation but be of good cheer I've overcome the world and I'm using that trial I'm using that I'm not saying you want any trials don't think all it's just gonna be this obviously easy life", "but you have the confidence of saying I have the blessing of God on my life no matter what happens whether it's things I wanted it's better than I asked for it's completely different not at all what I wanted but I'm trusting God I think about Mary and Joseph all they wanted to do was get married what's wrong with getting married that's what they wanted just a normal Jewish wedding happy to be together honeymoon yeah that's not gonna quite work out that way and sometimes God has to destroy your dream to bring you something far better than you would ever have asked for to use you in a way that you would not even know how to ask and so when things aren't going well in our lives we say but I'm walking by faith and so I know God is in charge he's good he's governing and he's gonna work things together for what he to bless me and to bring him glory so I have the blessing of God on my life even though I don't always see it until it's in the rearview mirror and even sometimes that but this down number four God promises you a great name a great name now maybe already like yours I don't know look at what he says there he says I will make your name great okay Abraham now this Abraham we can we can gather some things about Abraham we don't know he's for sure but we do know that he came from ur of the chaldeans oh he it doesn't have children which was not a plus he was wealthy we can we can tell that he evidently had some either money that he inherited or money that he invested and was doing fine with flocks and herds and even as he's traveling and he has some political clout as a result of that we also know that while he doesn't have children he clearly married a very attractive woman how can we figure that out I call Sarah Miss Mesopotamia because it's 65 the king of the world thinks that she's a knockout and once to take her does take her into his didn't to his harem 65 I don't know what beauty cream she was using but it worked so he's married to an attractive woman and he's he's evidently got wealth by the way herb the Cal DS was not primitive it is from the archaeal archaeology that's been done very very sophisticated wealthy people large homes 20 to 30 rooms or rooms of in their home huge it's where the bathtub was invented by", "the way so they had hot tubs and way way back when so here's a guy who has kind of a lot going for him in in terms of culture but he lacks the thing that matters the most he doesn't have any legacy and that mattered so much well what am what is my life count beyond my life if you don't have children you see the feeling was it doesn't some of you remember I've talked about this that the most important famous unbeliever who affects society there are big names that we study in history you know of people who didn't know the Lord maybe Napoleon or Genghis Khan or some of these you know world rulers and and we know of them we can read and read and read about things they accomplished but from God's standpoint it's very different by the way that's why you don't read about everything that happens in history in the Bible it doesn't matter doesn't even rate to be in God's history book it's not it's not important on this in the scheme of things very interesting and I like that illustration that it's kind of like the most significant non-christian who did the most that we've all studied in history it's kind of like in terms of eternity like that big aircraft carrier or a cruise ship that goes through the harbor and you look at the wake of the ship and it's this huge wake might go out for a mile but compared to the ocean in an hour or two it's gone forever and in terms of eternity the unbeliever makes no impact for the glory of God ever God's looking at things completely different so God's taking this man who has no legacy no impact on even time much less eternity and he is going to give him make him even though he's already 75 and he's not famous yet God says I'm gonna give you a great name now interesting they tell us and I don't know how they figured this out about a hundred and seven billion people have lived and died on planet Earth but God says to Abraham I'm gonna put my spotlight on you and he did if you think about it right now about four of the seven billion people on the planet revere the name abraham about 2.2 billion Christians about 1.6 billion Muslims and numerous million Jews all revere the name Abraham over half the world's population today all these years later still no his name still respect him very interesting God fulfilled this God nailed that he did it he's given him a great name I", "mean it's just he's done that can I tell you something within your soul in my soul there is a desire for glory okay now we tend to think that's all wrong you know the kid who gets the basketball who never passes right we all have a name for that he always shoots misses when he could have given it to me and I could have missed you call that being a glory hog right and we talk about pride and it's true you know is this not Babylon the Great that I myself have yes it's the initial center but the desire for glory is not in and of itself sin in fact God has made you read Romans in a righteous way to want glory it's about who's giving it to you and who it's ultimately for that matters but God says Abram I'm gonna make your name great and it was a good thing wasn't like oh god you shouldn't do that some of you may have heard me I don't know what your earliest memory is you know our earliest memories are kind of weird because they kind of little little things that happen to us when we were little kids maybe I was probably three maybe two I don't know that I distinctly remember I'm the youngest of five my mom and my older I mean my brother might have been my sister I don't know we're in the other room and they had my mom and told me to go to my bedroom and I remember I don't know she wanted me to pick up my toys or go to take a nap but I was in there and I didn't really want to be in there but I heard them talking I couldn't understand what they were saying but I remember this thought what if I'm really the king of the world and they're pretending that I'm not and they want to keep it a secret because if I knew the truth I'd be telling them what to do this is two or three years old these thoughts are running through my mind I still wonder from time no I'm just my middle son valor very interesting that we named him valor not knowing that he was going to be very timid when he would be growing up when he was younger he was very timid he once was frightened a cat that was asleep on my neighbor's lawn it came back very afraid of the cat that was there like was a monster and so he'd have to grow into that name valor but he was rather shy but a sweet", "spirited young man I'm never very generous I remember once we came home we came home Becky and him had gone through McDonald or had some fast food I haven't eaten and he was sitting there eating hot McDonald's fries on the table in front of me which I think is not very nice anyway but any because I was really hungry and and so he could tell I wanted one so I he said dad you want one I said oh okay and so he gave me a fry and he enjoyed watching me like it so he started feeding me the fries and I was so impressed that he was because I'm thinking I probably wouldn't do that I mean he's he's giving me these french fries of his while he's still hungry and I turned to him and I said I said that's amazing I said you're so generous I said I said you're my hero he has no I'm not oh yeah you're my hero he goes I'm not I go Valerie you're my hero he goes I'm a so I read about God saying I'm gonna make your name great and I think to myself well this is not a promise that someday I'll be famous in myself here's the idea you and me were in Christ now and one day every knee will bow and every tongue will confess that Jesus Christ is Lord this is origin we are in him the one who is the most famous we have a great name already amen he put this down you are blessed to become a blessing we all want to be blessed but please notice why he said in there in verse 2 he says I'll make your name great so you shall be you know there are today in our day and age and for the last I'd say 20 years pronouncing the United States that I've seen maybe longer a fair number of Christians and some of the largest churches in America where the theology is about it's all about you the Bible is the ultimate self-help book if you want to know how to run a business here it is if you want to have good relationships here it is you want to meet the guide meet the girl and get them to love you here in other words it's all about technique and this book is is your book of how to get to where you want to be and so we read I want God's gonna bless me but here's the reality if you read this blessing that God is putting on Abraham's life God isn't blessing him to", "be a container of blessing he's blessing him to become a channel of blessing in other words I'll bless you but I'm blessing you so that other people can be blessed I think we miss this often it's just because we're look I'm the same way you know our three best friends humanly are me myself and I you know our favorite song is me me wish I don't have to work nobody I said Bob take care of yourself hello I wasn't gonna do that I'm big on that I wake up thinking about me and my comfort and you know I mean if I'm if I'm in pain I baby myself you know I try to think when my wife's her name what would I would I would I have to I love her but I literally that doesn't come as natural to me last night in the dunk tank I was done three times and I do not know what's in that tank cuz they're not supposed to be anything in there but whatever it is I hit it three times my elbow hit a three times at the time didn't bother me too much middle of the night it bothered me a whole lot I woke up in this terrible pain because of my elbow no I'm not gonna sue the church but I care about me I take care of me I look out for me so I don't want to look at scripture that it's only about me or primarily about me but it's my nature to do it jot down John 7:37 this is a verse I think we do with all this we do with a lot more than we know here's the promise on the last day of the great day of the feast Jesus stood up and cried out if anyone is thirsty let him come to me and drink now he's saying if you're thirsty it's personal spiritually you're dry come to Jesus and drink we don't have the next verse do we that's just it let them come to me and drink and you know the promise and out of his innermost being shall flow rivers or some translations say torrents of living water or this he spoke of the spirit now here's the thing we think of that oh yeah that's right if you'll come to Jesus he will heal he'll satisfy your thirst that's true but that's not all that verse says if he is gonna make you a torrent or a nice fountain of living waters what does that tell you how much water does a fountain how thirsty is a fountain not at all", "a fountain becomes a source for thirsty people what did David say you know surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life besides which my cup is filled to the rim with him no my cup what it's overflowing do you see the difference God is saying I want you to be so blessed that you become a source of blessing for other people it's the reason I'm blessing you it is to fulfill your needs but it's much more than that it's to satisfy the needs of people around you because I want to use you as a vehicle whereby I'll bless other people well put this down number 6 God ties his blessing to how people treat his own there is a very important you've heard this perhaps and I think it's fascinating historically he said I'll bless those who bless you and the ones who curses the one who curses you I will curse it seems if you look at history virtually every nation that has persecuted the Jewish people has gone into a decline think think of Egypt Egypt was a world empire in the ancient world during the time of Abram there's gonna be a famine and a few verses he's going down he's going down to Egypt always going down people you by the way you always go down to Egypt you go up to Jerusalem you go down to Egypt and it's it's almost always an expression of unbelief unless God's ordering you there then those are the rare exceptions but Egypt world Empire but where is it today not a world empire some would call it a Babylon attacked Israel the Babylonians are gone look at Iraq talk about a place that is messed up those are the descendants that's the geography of Babylon Israel remains Israel is a strong nation Rome tried to destroy Israel Jerusalem but the Roman Empire is no more after their persecution of the Jews the Greeks absolutely have fallen apart their empire after defaming the temple Spain after the Inquisition was reduced to a fifth-rate nation Germany in more recent history I mean Germany the 20th century was becoming a world empire intended to take over the world incredible power almost did it persecuted the Jews look at it today compared to where it was just 60 or 70 years ago I do believe in part the reason God has blessed prospered and even protected and preserved this nation is because we have been a nation that has been a refuge historically for the Jewish people for the persecuted Jews and if that changes I believe with God's", "protection and blessing on this nation isn't just because of our forefathers I believe it has in part to do with this commitment of God those who bless you I will bless those who curse you I will curse very very interesting to me then number seven God promises to deliver a universal source of blessing in the final promise here he says I will impart in you all the families of the earth will be blessed that's pretty radical now am I going to make you a great nation you're gonna be famous but beyond that in you every family in the entire world will be able to be blessed that's pretty cool let me ask you what was that blessing that God was promising in that verse raise your hand I heard somebody say something yes how so yes you can I believe in you walk by faith not by Bob Jesus is the descendant of Abraham Jesus is the Messiah God's redeeming mankind and he's starting with a man he's gonna create a nation and it's it is the Messiah and how by the way how do we know that it's the Messiah how do we have we verify that besides just I think it is anybody give me a Bible answer on that yeah over okay sign some wonders that he did anybody else yes Matthew one so showing that he's a descendent from Abraham okay say again Christ is all when the rose from the dead Jesus dim okay so in chapter 22 this promise gets a little bit more particular we won't turn there but here it says in you all the families of the earth shall be blessed later God will refine it and say in your seed will all the families of the earth be blessed who is the seed of Abraham David Jesus is the seed of Abraham okay so in the New Testament we are told that God didn't say though he could have the seeds of Abraham plural referring to the Jewish people some people say well this was a promise that the Jewish people would be a blessing and certainly God has used the Jewish people look God made that his people the chosen people the nation of Israel and from them we the law of God the the revelation of God we have the Bible because of Abraham and his descendants but specifically Paul tells us that the promise in your seed singular he was referring to the Messiah and so here we have this promise I'm gonna bless you and you're gonna be your ultimately you and your descendants and", "one particular person that I have in mind is gonna come from you and guess what he will become a blessing to the whole world why is Jesus a blessing to the whole world let me ask it like that and what way is Jesus a blessing to the whole world because he died for the whole world the people have never heard he died for every single human being on this planet and it's in Jesus Christ that the promises of God are fulfilled I don't care who you're talking to I don't care what language they speak on a work care what country you're in Jesus Christ is the blessing that God has for them you see in you all the families are there everybody who lives on this planet there's a blessing it is their Messiah - it is their Savior who's gonna come from in this case your loins Abraham and so that's what he's teaching Abraham but he's also teaching it to us we the blessing of God on our life is to become a vehicle of blessing not just I Love You God bless you can I help you I want you to meet my Savior I want you to meet the one who saved me I now have the privilege you have the privilege of being a source of blessing ultimate blessing to anyone who ever lives on this planet that's the idea finally let's put this down God is calling you to live life as a faith road trip we're called to walk by faith not by sight Peter Marshall I don't know how many of you some of you know his name he was a chaplain in the Senate immigrated to the United States arriving at Ellis Island 1927 only 19 years before being named Senate chaplain he pastored in Georgia and then at Washington's New York Avenue Presbyterian Church and on January 5th 1947 he was named Senate chaplain and his prayers immediately touched the nation this was a prayer offered before the United States Senate on November 24th 1947 here's what he said god of our fathers and our God give us the faith to believe in the ultimate triumph of righteousness no matter how dark and uncertain are the skies of today we pray for the bifocals of faith that see the despair and the need of the hour but also see further on the patience of our God working out his plan in the world he has made so help thy servants to interpret for our time the meaning of the motto inscribed on our coins make our faith honest by helping us this day", "to do one thing because thou has said do it or to abstain because thou has said thou shalt not how can we say we believe in thee or even want to believe in me when we do not anything that thou does tell us may our faith be seen in our works through Jesus Christ our Lord amen he says lord give us bifocals help us to see what's going on but also help us to focus on your plans your promises in the Word of God to walk by faith we need both we need to say Lord I want to be not walking simply by sight we're not gonna be blind other things on this earth by any means walking by faith doesn't mean we ignore the things that are we're not to lean on an understanding but we are to be men and women who understand the times we live in but we don't make our judgments based on that you see we see beyond them that's why I like this prayer bifocals of faith yeah God that's what I want I want to remember the promise seven promises that he's made to Abraham that I think and very much a real sense there's application for me and you Lord make me a man of faith make me a woman of faith let me be willing to leave anybody in anything what is the old song say the cross before me the world behind me no turning back no go with me still I will follow no is there somebody that's holding you somebody that you're compromising for that's calling you to leave anything that would call you back sometimes it's stuff sometimes it's not people it's stuff as Jesus said remember Lot's wife what's keeping you back let's", "we commit our time to the Lord in prayer so let's pray Lord thank you for fact that what we just saying when serving you when following you puts us in the fire you're a God that stands there with us and keeps us from being consumed heat we still have to stand in it we still have to experience it we still have to walk the road that led us to it but Lord you're with us through it all help us to focus on you as we sing this song and as we prepare our hearts to partake in communion Lord that you would be the focal point of the room that we would collectively agree to glorify Our God in heavens we love you in Jesus name creation there at the start before the time with no point of reference spoke to the dark and fleshed Out The Wonder of and as you plan if the stars were to worship so I can see your heart and everything made every burning star sign fire of GRA creation sings your Praises so will God of your promise you don't speak in vain no syllable empty your voice and once you have spoken I'll make sure and sence follow the sound of your and as you speak 100 billion creatures cat your breath alling in pursuit of what you say it all reveals your so alive I can see your heart in everything say every pain is Sky and can of your if the stars were made to worship so I the mountains bow with rence so will I if the oce are all your greatness so Li for if everything exists to lift you high so will I if the wind goes away you send it so will I if the rocks cry out in silence oh if the sun of all it will s a 100 billion Salvation you Chas on my heart through all of my failure and pride on to hear you created the light of the world abandoned in darkness to but as you speak a 100 billion failures disappear where you lost your life so I can find it here if you live the grave behind you so I can see your heart and everything done every part designed in

a man you could to your you're the one who never leaves the one", "behind uh to celebrate the fact that Jesus Christ is alive from the dead and reigning in this world he will never leave us nor forsake us the Bible says in Hebrews he ever lives to make intercession for us which means he's praying for us even now as he stands before the father so we are here to celebrate things that happened in history but we are applying them right now in the midst of our regular real life and most of us of course have heard the news and we've been rocked by these terrible attacks that have happened to Israel the numbers jump from 300 dead to 600 overnight from these rocket attacks and uh thousands injured many of whom their lives may be in danger so we've been praying we had a prayer meeting this morning some of you came um some of you couldn't make it but I just want to before we celebrate communion really ask the Lord to move on on on our behalf as a congregation to be praying for that we stand with Israel we believe that that's what God would call us to do he said those who bless you I will bless those who curse you I will curse so we're praying for our nation to come alongside as much as it can but but really for God to bring peace and protection for the nation of Israel that is under attack and we're not surprised you know if you read Psalm 83 if you read Ezekiel you know that these are ancient enemies of Israel and he predicted that they will be so in the last days so we are not shocked but we the nation of Israel 50 years ago was attacked on yam kapor almost to the day and here on another Jewish holiday um they were attacked again they're calling this their Pearl Harbor their 911 Israel by the way was one of the few Nations that really stood with us uh on 911 in 2001 they had a they have a memorial to our Americans that died on 911 I don't know if you know that but uh we want to express uh not only gratitude for the nation of Israel but um pray for them for their protection and for their salvation so I'm going to give thanks for the bread and the cup the communion will be handed out during the next song but let's let just go before the Lord together and would you agree with me in prayer father we do pray for an ending of this Bloodshed in the Middle East um it's", "easy to pray that we don't live there but Lord many of us have friends there right now I pray for Cleo tby who's there in Jerusalem I pray for her friends tomare and Maas who are soldiers Lord I pray for amir's family and many of us know people that are there now and either In Harm's Way or we haven't heard from them so we have a personal interest in our friends but Lord for this nation that you have chosen for yourself you have made promises to them even in their unbelief you have fulfilled your promises to bring them back and restore them as a nation and you have fulfilled Ezekiel 37 causing these dry bones to come together as one nation putting now your spirit in them and giving them life Lord how we pray you would bring them to Faith in their Messiah we know you will you said they will look upon me whom they have pierced and they'll mourn for him as One Mourns for an only son in Zechariah that day is coming but in until it does Lord prepare them for their need for the Messiah their recognition of who he really is and I pray many would come to Faith In The Living Lord Jesus Christ and you would protect Believers that are there Christians on both sides of this conflict but for us Lord in our circumstances in our life right now we want to be right with you we want to be clean before you we want to be forgiven and remember Jesus you died for us and rose again to handle the problems and the conflicts we're facing the emergencies that we're in you are sufficient for them because nothing catches You by surprise so thank you for the bread thank you for the cup thank you for the cross thank you for the empty tomb the celebration that we get to have every Sunday but especially this one as we take the bread and cup aresh in Jesus name I hear the Savior say thy strength indeed is small weakness Watch and Pray Finding Me by all and all Jesus Paid It all all to him I ow s had left a Crimson Stain he wash it wi as sow oh now indeed I find thy power and on alone get change the Le box and the the Heart of Jus made it all all to S the cron St he it was Throne I stand in him complete Jesus died my soul the say my lips shall still be Jesus f it all all to him", "I sin had left a crimson State he washed St sin had left a Crimson Stain he W it was a s he walk he want sow he was he oh praise the one who save my dead and raise his life up from the dead oh praise the one L my de and lay this life up from the dead oh L the one who take my dead and raise his life up from the dead oh praise the one p my dead and raise his life up from the dead Oh Praise who on her they my de and raise his power up from the dead oh water in my dead and raise his SP from the Jesus Paid It all all to him my y s had left a Crimson Stain he was it snow s had left a crimson State seated so the timing of the Lord's table we kind of pull it out of scripture and we make it as part of our service and I don't have any problem with doing that but contextually we need to remember where it happened it it happened right two failures on the part of the disciples because Jesus had just spent time in the Garden of Gethsemane calling them to pray with him as he really was embracing the cross when he said if there's a way for me to not take this cup when he referred to the cup he had previously said there is a cup I need to drink from to James and John he said are you able to drink from this cup he was talking about death remember he said he had a baptism to undergo Jesus was accepting the cross at his father's hand and he had asked for his disciples stay awake and pray um that's all I'm asking and and they didn't they completely fell asleep and then of course right after the Lord's Supper is when Jesus will you know be arrested and uh so it's like there's this failure on their part uh and so when we have communion it is celebrating what Jesus did for us but it is in the context of our sin that we come and remember what he did we don't just say thank you for dying we say thank you for dying for me and forgiving me of my failures I had I should have lived up to who I was in Christ this last week I shouldn't have lost my temper I shouldn't have whatever it sins that we've committed we want to be honest to God with a short list of honesty about", "saying Lord I I stand in need of your forgiveness I'm not going through a ritual I want to restore a relationship but also I think in light of what's going on in the world to realize that the disciples had no idea about how difficult things were about to go for them they couldn't understand that Jesus would be arrested he'd be crucified and everything felt like it was falling apart and there are times in our life where that's us we we either feel that or we don't realize it yet but it's about to and the Lord is saying you know what I want you to focus instead on what I've done for you you can take this to the bank I love you I have risen from the dead I've forgiven your sins don't ever doubt my love no matter how hard it gets because it's going to get harder at times in our life Jesus said in this world you'll have tribulation be of good cheer I've overcome the world Jesus Took the bread representing his own very sinless life the unleavened bread and he said this is my body given for you when you eat it remember me let's do Lord we don't stand before you as those who have lived out our faith any more than your disciples did after the Last Supper when they went to the garden and then failed and failed again Lord we don't expect because we've had communion or gone to church today that we're not going to fail you in our faith later today or this week but we also know that we have no excuse for why we do sin so we don't need an excuse we savior we need to be cleansed and forgiven and filled with your spirit thank you for shedding your blood on the cross for our sins that that it is sufficient that propitiation has been satisfied and God's Wrath has been taken care of and now Lord we stand as forgiven sinners now called Saints but we celebrate you as our savior that you loved us then and you love us now thank you for this cup and and all that it represents that you went through and that you now are applying to our lives Jesus Took the cup after supper he gave thanks and he said this is the New Covenant in my blood from now on when you drink it remember me we love you Lord not anywhere near as much as you love us but we do love you because you first loved us help us to love you more help us to love you", "practically today and help us to walk in love in Jesus name amen amen well I want don't you to pass your cups to the the guys and

after blessfest to Pastor a church there in in Carlinville uh Southern Illinois and many of you did hear Pastor Mike while I was gone uh", "month or two ago he preached and he mentioned that he is being called eventually to Arkansas to start what we think is going to be a Calvary Chapel there in Arkansas and so we've got two assistant pastors both of whom feel led to do that what you might not know is that things have changed for Mike's schedule we thought it was going to be next year it is going to be next month so Pastor Mike Williams is uh going to be leaving at the end of actually the

click on to let them know that you appreciate them so keep them in prayer we're excited for them obviously uh God's providing for us we know that it's the right time and we feel really good about this direction they're going in so we support him like you to open your Bibles John 2 John or 2 John as some people call it I don't call it that 2 John uh beginning in verse 4 and we're going to go to verse 6 John writes this in verse four I was very glad to find some of your children Walking In Truth just as we have received commandment to do from the father now I ask you lady which sounds kind of impersonal but remember he's writing to this chosen lady now I ask you lady not as though I were writing to you a new commandment but the one which we have had from the beginning", "that we love one another and this is love that we walk according to his Commandments this is the Commandment just as you have heard from the beginning that you should walk in it father would you teach us U today again and aesh what it means to obey you what it looks like in our life thank you that you've used this term to help us to understand how it's to affect every part of our life and not just our church life or our Christian Life Lord but that you want to have our entire lives a a reflection of the fact that we have put our faith in Jesus Christ so Lord help us to understand it to see it help us to walk in balance in Jesus name I pray amen you can be seated so I was I don't know three or4 years old living in lamada at the time and I remember there was a park across the street a hill in a park called Garden Hill Park and I was uh this is one of my earliest memories um at least living in that house was the time that I got to go over to the playground and play on the on the equipment and um so I don't know if you have a memory of your earliest days doing that but it was kind of a big deal going on the the the equipment myself and I remember going up on the big slide of course everything's big to a three-year-old you know big metal slide I couldn't wait to slide down it was a little scary you know and didn't need to be scared except I should have been more aware of how hot it was burned my leg on the it was hot day and I had little shorts on there and uh so then I went from there over to the merry gound which I had never been on before I had seen kids having a good time and I came to the conclusion marry gound only about half of the name it is is is actually correct it does it does go around but it was not merry for me or whoever had to clean up after me yeah not my thing at all um yeah I had problems with balance uh and and and getting sick motion sickness from the youngest uh ages but then there was that piece of equipment I'll never forget it was unique and different than all the others and uh it's called the seesaw you remember that I what would made that one different you couldn't", "even do that one yourself there's no way to do that you had to have somebody else that was willing to do it with you what I would quickly discover is from that day on if it usually was a kid that was bigger than me or heavier that would sucker in the kids get on it and then they'd sit down and you'd be stranded up there in the air crying to please please please let me down and of course if if and when they did let you down you never forgot that either they would just hop off you know and I think about that piece of equipment when I think about this passage you say Bob you have a strange mind I agree I do but here is why regarding truth and love both of which are mentioned in in 2 John Truth and Love here's the phrase you want to fill in it's balance or disaster kind of like the Teeter Totter balance or disaster our tendency is either to fall off the horse so focused on truth that we aren't loving but it's okay because we we know the truth some people know the truth and they're right but they're dead right and other times we can actually dishonor the truth Truth by the way we think we're loving by not truly holding to the truth and so that balance becomes very very difficult if your balance is off it is often detected in your walk we had a woman this last week had the elders pray for her she had a 12-hour brain surgery for what's known as an acoustic neuroma some of you have heard of that word some of you have never heard of it it's a tumor inside the brain in the ear area and because of it um she could not balance herself when um to walk actually seems like nothing to most of us but your brain is doing an amazing thing to balance you as you walk um when I was a police officer um I had to administer what's called a field sobriety test and I did that quite often arresting people whose driving appeared to be impaired to find out if maybe they were under the influence of alcohol drugs it's a it's a field test it's not a it's not a breath test or a urine test or a blood test but it's something to test motor skills and hopefully none of you have had the test personally and you've seen it or know of it or what drove by and saw a cop doing it but there's real basic things that you do", "that just about anybody almost anybody who's sober can do fairly easily like counting on your fingers by going one 2 3 4 5 5 4 3 2 1 and doing it accurately that's pretty relative I didn't blow it it's pretty easy or uh for instance touching your finger to your tip of your nose with your eyes closed most of us can do that no problem when you're not under the influence or reciting the alphabet which seems so basic and is offensive to people when I used to say did you get educated here in the United States oh yeah how about you I yes this is about you though it's all about you today um you know yes I have a PhD I have a masters I have a bachelor whatever yes of course I you know well can you just simply recite your alphabet are you kidding you bet and then they would recite their ABCs but quite often if they were under the influence either they couldn't do it they thought they could but they couldn't or they even if they did it they would sing it I had many people many drunk drivers sing to me the alphabet and even get to the end now I'm done my I'm not kidding you that was proof that they weren't drunk you know I had one guy who tried to do the alphabet repeatedly kept messing it up and he turned to me he goes m i SS I SS I PBI like oh wow you're so sober go here's your keys you're going with me but another part of the field sobriety test is just balancing yourself with one foot off the ground or walking Heel To Toe in a straight line because it's very difficult to do that if you're impaired I share that because In this passage we're talking about love John is the Apostle of love he says more about love than any other writer but he says more about truth than any other writer and he's talking about walking you'll use that word three times peripato in the Greek to walk which is of course speaking of physical walking many times in scripture it's used 90 times but quite often it's a metaphor for the way you live so put this down we are to walk in truth that's verse 4 I was very glad to find some of your Truth ch down Psalm 116:1 if you're inclined to write down verses the psalmist said I said in my alarm in the Hebrew I said in haste I said in my haste all men are", "liars J Vernon McGee said if he had written that verse he would have written I said in my haste all men are liars and then I thought about it and I said it again because that's what the Bible actually teaches us and you might be a very honest person but if you're really honest you're honest enough to admit you're not always honest and if you're not admitting that you're probably not honest it's kind of built within our culture we just accept this this isn't lying when somebody says to you today hey how you doing and you say fine how are you and maybe the person that asked you couldn't care less and your answer had nothing to do with reality just way we're supposed to talk to each other oh no it's just kind of a part of who we are we don't have to be completely truthful heard a story of Ronald Reay and his wife Nancy going through a cemetery looking at the headstones and Nancy was looking at one Ron was looking at another one and she said Ronnie you got to see this one this one says here lies a politician and an honest man and Ronald Reagan said they buried two people in that huh I don't remember who wrote or sent this to me but they did some years ago on this very issue of being honest about husbands and their wives what he says and what he means he says can I help with dinner he really means why isn't it already on the table he says uh-huh sure honey yes dear he really means absolutely nothing it's response he says it would take too long to explain but what he really means is I have no idea how it works he says we're going to be late really what he means is now I have a legitimate excuse to drive like a maniac he says take a break honey you're working too hard hard what he really means is I can't hear the game over the cleaner he says that's interesting dear what he really means is are you still talking well I hope this is not you he says I can't find it what he really means is it didn't fall into my outstretched hands so I'm completely clueless guilty he says you know I could never love anyone else and what he really means is I'm used to the way you yell at me and realize it could be worse he says you look terrif what he really means is please don't try on one more outfit I'm", "starving he says I'm not lost I know exactly where we are what he means is no one will ever see us alive again wow I trust that's somewhat of a joke but the fact is truthfulness the Bible says God desires truth in the innermost being and here's why God is the God of all truth whenever he speaks he's truthful he always keeps his promises and Jesus says it's the very character of who he is I am the way the heia the truth the truth not partially true not somewhat true I am the truth 100% so we are to walk in truth and I want you to see this because first of all truth is praiseworthy jot it down praiseworthy walking in the truth put in that word in our text John says I'm glad to find some of your children walking in truth and we should mention in the very next book in third John also in verse 4 he mentioned mentions this same subject look at it you can turn the page or look over 3rd John verse4 I have no Greater Joy than this than to hear of my walking in the truth now in third John he's talking about his own children second John he's talking about this woman's children and the joy that it brings Walking In Truth brings praise to God and it brings encouragement to our hearts and that's true if you're a parent uh how many of you have children first of all let just see who the parents are okay then you are Desiring your children if you are walking with the Lord you want your kids to walk in the Lord you want them to make good decisions that blesses you when that happens somebody sent me after first service during the service I closed in prayer said let's pray and they sent me this picture just a few minutes ago this is somebody at home who was watching the service and I said let's pray and their 13-month-old Collins closed her eyes to pray PR and they snapped a picture because it blessed them and it blessed their relatives who were here that blessed me and I'm trying to bless you here's why we get excited when our children are actually knowing the Lord walking with the Lord or moving in that direction and if you have children I know that's your desire No Greater Joy than my children to walk in the truth and probably no greater hurt than when they don't and maybe maybe for you today either you don't have kids or your kids aren't walking with the Lord", "and that's a hard thing someone once said that um a parent is only doing as well as their child who's doing the worst because if I have three kids and two of them are walking with the Lord and one's not of course my prayer and concern is for that one who isn't child raising is not easy I'm convinced it's one of the greatest challenges to our faith it's also one of the greatest blessings that you'll ever have but comes with it trusting God for what your kids are going to decide thinking when they're little you have control over them and you're going to make you're going to raise them in the way of the Lord because there's that promise they won't depart from it and you know you got it down because they're now obedient praying with you and doesn't always turn out that way as they get older um Charlie shed he was a p Presbyterian Minister he actually uh did a series on parenting he said before we had kids though I used to travel across the country teaching a lecture I called The Ten Commandments for raising perfect after he and his wife had their first child he changed the title to 10 hints parents after their second child the title was a few suggestions for fellow strugglers and after their third child he just quit speaking on the seven child just kind of gave up and so maybe you feel like I can relate to that I I I I want my kids to follow the lord I pray that they would I hope I wasn't the not but even if your kids or you don't have any aren't following the Lord what John is saying in second Johan is I'm praising God I was encouraged I was joyful that your kids are and he does say some and I point that out only because what he doesn't say what it appears to mean perhaps is there are some who are and some who aren't I didn't say that but it does say some I'm glad you're some you kind of he didn't say all so you kind of Wonder he could have said you know um I heard something some of your kids are really blowing it but he doesn't focus on that and I point that out because it is our nature to focus many times on what's wrong in our kids' lives in our own lives it's just natural we see the problems but I want you to jot down Philippians 4:8 because I think he's applying it Philippians 4:8 Paul says this finally Brethren whatever is true", "whatever is Honorable whatever is right whatever is pure whatever is lovely whatever is of good repute if there's any excellence and if there's anything worthy of Praise well let your mind dwell on these things so interesting to me that when somebody's walking in truth it brings Joy even not just to their parents but to other people who watch it put this down number two walk in truth because walking makes truth practical and Powerful it makes truth practical and Powerful he says I was very glad to find some of your children Walking In Truth just as we have received commandment to do now I want you to understand there's a relationship between truth and Commandments they're not the same truth is of course everything that God says Commandments are very specific applications of truth it's kind of like the relationship of water and ice cubes all ice cubes are made of water but not all water are ice cubes all of God's word is true it's the water the Commandments are the specific way we apply the truth to our lives and it's important that you see the relationship between the two you might put it this way the Commandments make God's truth usable in our lives and by the way as you obey the Lord it has power to be a witness to other people that you are a follower of Jesus Christ that you love him that you believe in him true story Alexander the great who during his time in the 4th Century BC conquered most of the known worlds was said to have wet because there were no more worlds to conquer at one point had a very small army and he was trying to take a fortress of a city that was shut up and the King within it and the Army within it kind like Jericho but it wasn't Jericho and uh the story is told that Alexander the Great himself came to the gates of this big fortress and said I want to talk to the king the king came to the to the to the wall and said what do you want he said I want you to surrender immediately said we're not going to surrender he laughed at Alexander why would I Surrender you got a small army out there I'm not worried about it you can't get in here at which point Alexander said watch Alexander commanded his men to walk in single file March out to a cliff all within the view of the city and then he ordered them to march one at a time they started marching", "right off the side of the cliff to their deaths 10 men in a row died until he said halt went back to the city and demanded they surrender the king surrendered understanding if your men are that committed to obeying you all of them I don't have a chance it is our obedience to the Lord because we love him that causes the world to stand up and say what is it about this God that you have a relationship with him that you would do things for him you would sacrifice for him the things that don't make sense when God told Abraham take thy son thy only son up to the mountain and you are to sacrifice him we know the Lord didn't have him do it because the Lord himself will be the one sacrificing the son but he said now I know actually he already knew but now you know what's in your own heart God brings us tests of obedience to reveal to us and to others the faith that we really have put this down number three we walk in truth because it's been provided Ed that is the truth that we have the Commandments it's provided by our father did you see that in the text you might want to Circle it we have received Commandments to do so from our father from our father our commander is not our just our creator he knows what we can handle I love that we are to entrust ourselves to a faithful Creator the Bible says in doing what is right he knows what I can handle see every car or vehicle that you came to church in this morning by the manufacturer has some kind of a sticker is written somewhere how much weight it can handle there's a capacity God knows your load capacity that's 1 Corinthians 10:13 no trial has overtaken you such as is common to man God's faithful he won't allow you to be tried beyond your load capacity you can trust I know he made me and he knows what I can handle remember the little boy carrying the wood in and the neighbor said that's too big of a load he said no it's not my father gave it to me and he knows what I can handle so we can rest in that even at times when we feel overwhelmed but our commander in this verse isn't just our creator he's actually our heavenly father a pastor moved to a a kind of a farm country and he caught his son out playing outside and he was unfortunately he was a little", "boy he was playing with a cowp Patty and uh the little boy thought it was interesting his father had to tell him to stop playing with it because he knew although it's seemed fun to his boy it wasn't healthy for him to even touch it much less play with it yeah or eat it you you mention that um here's what we need to realize when God gives us a commandment it's coming from our loving father in other words when God says for instance flee immorality that's 1 Corinthians 6:18 the word in the Greek immorality by the way is the word porni it's where we get our word pornography but it's not just talking about pornography it's talking about all forms of sexual sin as listed in Leviticus 18 every form adultery beastiality homos every form of sexual sin adultery all of it but he says to run from it he's not telling us to do that because he's some kind of a cosmic killjoy he's not saying if you fail to obey my commandment I'll punish you read Proverbs 5 and 6 the person who commits himself can a man take fire into his bosom and not be burned can he walk on hot coals and not be burned it's a cause and effect you do it he who would destroy himself God isn't saying I want to keep you from enjoying yourself he's saying I want to keep you from destroying yourself why because he's a loving father so we obey his Commandments because we know he knows what is best for us not just we know what we want so we're to walk in truth and then letter be we're to walk in love this is the balance in verse 5 now I ask you lady not as though I were writing to you some new commandment but the one which we have had from the beginning that we love one another in the phrase from the beginning John is always referring to the beginning of the ministry of Jesus by the way and he's talking about the command that Jesus gave that we love one another as he has loved us put this down love requests but does not demand or doesn't Force love requests but does not demand why do I say that well it's actually not doesn't come out in the English but in the Greek when he says I ask you lady it's actually a term in the original language that somebody asks of an equal John doesn't say I am the Apostle John Thou shalt no I'm just requesting it I'm asking you for you to", "make this decision it's very interesting to me Jesus the Creator the Lord the judge of the whole earth invites people to come to him talk about a condescension the one who rules the universe and has all authority to demand compliance says if anyone is come is anybody weary come if anyone is come you know we think about that verse Revelation 3:20 it's often used in gospel presentations I've used it myself I love it because it pictures Jesus knocking at the door behold I stand at the door and I knock if anyone hears my voice and opens the door I'll come into him and I'll Su with him I'll fellowship with this invitation of the Lord have you ever thought about that the Lord is asking for per permission to come into someone's life he created you and then he paid for you after he created you to redeem you from sin so he we his twice by creation and by Redemption but he still is just asking and by the way you know this Revelation 3:20 is not written to a Lost Sinner it's written to the church that's mind-blowing it's like Jesus what are you doing on the outside of your own church asking permission to come into your church how did you get there maybe there's some of you here today and that's exactly why God has you come to church today because you're a Christian you're a Believer you've given your life to the Lord but somehow the Lord is on the outside of your life again not that you need to get saved again but he's no longer the Lord of your life and he's not angry at you he's knocking he's not knocking you he's knocking at the door asking permission to come in seems seems incredible to me that he would do that praise God he doesn't just walk away or do what I used to do as a cop and kick the door in he's so patient I'll be honest with you while I'm not trying to make light of the passage it reminds me of that final scene of The Flintstones remember every time how The Flintstones end it's Fred going to bed and he puts the cat out saber-tooth tiger cat and the cat jumps back in the window while Fred outside and locks the door cuz cats can do that and okay just go with me on this and so you know here's Fred trying to get into his own house pounding on his door not as politely as Jesus I might add willma sorry I woke some up that's good", "um That's How It Ends the owner of the house the man of the house locked out and what I want to say to you about that is this this this is the love of God that is so patient even with Sinners who he has a right to have their life now listen to me the Lord does command us to love him in the scriptures that's true but we need to see how he causes us to come to him 31:3 Old Testament the Lord appeared to Israel from afar saying I have loved you with an Everlasting Love Therefore notice this I have drawn you with loving kindness that Hebrew ised uh it mean Tender Mercies or Grace or Mercy we would say I have drawn you I've loved you with an everlasting love and I'm drawn you the Bible says in the New Testament in Romans it's the kindness of God that leads us to repentance Jesus said if I be lifted up literally when I'm lifted up he's talking about the cross when I be lifted up I'll draw all men to myself it's the it's the magnet of his affection that would sacrifice his life for you that's going to draw you it's not just his ordering you I'm the king I am the god of the universe you should do it I'm the Lord no it's the way that he loves you like you've never been Loved Before that causes you to say I want to give my life to him then notice this Walking In Love is more than talking about love and verse 5 he says it's not like I'm writing a new commandment but that one which we've had from the beginning that we love one another verse six this is love that we walk according to Commandments um Ephesians 6 and verse4 talks about the armor of God many of you are familiar we've studied this before how we're to stand in the character of Christ in the armor of God and it begins with these words stand firm there for having girded your truth it's interesting the armor of God he doesn't say and Truth is the thinking cap you should have like your kindergarten said teacher said no no no truth is not pictured as something of a helment truth is pictured as a belt now they would cinch up their loins they would gird their they take a belt and they'd cinch up their garments for men would have these long flowing garments it was very difficult to work in or run in so they'd have to hike them", "up and cinch them off always in the scripture the idea of ging your loins has to do with you're about to act Peter says gir up your loins for Action God says gir up your loins like a man I'm going to ask you some questions get ready because it's time to answer it's time to act and so it is in scripture this idea of Truth is supposed to lead us to action God gave his Commandments clearly to us because he loves us and we obey his Commandments if we do because we love him at least that's the reason he wants us to Jesus said if you love me keep my Commandments he even said if you love me you will and so that is the basis upon which I obey remember Peter who had made big claims about his love for the Lord I will never you you're saying everybody's going to fail you forgot for Pete's sake I would never do that I know Peter you're you're going to how many times did Peter deny the Lord three how many times did Jesus ask him that same question after the resurrection if he loved him three times coincidental it's not coincidental at all Peter you claim to love me with a sacrificial love that you would die for me was that true do you love me more guys the word Jesus used when he said Do You Love Me is in the original the word Agape it's the verb form agapa do do you love me with a sacrificial love obviously he didn't and Peter said well I have fileo love for you I have a friendship love mutual love Jesus asked him again do you let's go over that one more time do you have aape sacrificial love for me I have I have deep affection for you Lord as a friend so then Jesus changes the word Peter do you have fileo love for me a true affection as a friend and Peter's grieved that Jesus won't leave alone and he says you know all things you know I have filo for you each time that Jesus asks Peter do you love me and Peter claims to have some love for him he says then do something with it feed my little lambs feed my sheep if you love me don't just say you love me actually demonstrate that you love me by obeying me we demonstrate a love for God by obeying his Commandments we put this down don't merely love your Bible live Bible don't merely love your Bible I hope you do love your Bible I love the", "word the psalmist said how how I love thy law we should should love the word of God you know before you're a Christian you probably weren't in love with the word of God even after you became a Christian you're not automatically in love with the Bible it's a hard book to understand how can you love what you've never read you can say I love it don't know what it says but you start reading it it's like I have no idea what I'm reading and when I do understand it uh it just makes me feel guilty cuz I'm reading it like that guy that gave that Chinese man a Bible and he gave it back the next day he said you didn't want to read it he goes no I didn't read it go why are you giving it back because every time I read it it me yeah so the Bible be a difficult book to fall in love with but if you love the Lord then you say well I love the fact that he's told me what he wants me to know how he wants me to live he's telling me what he thinks about me what I should think about him and how I can please him don't merely love your Bible live your Bible it's true the Bible is easier read than done no question about it so a lot of us just naturally we satisfy ourselves that we're Christians and it demonstrates Itself by we believe the Bible we own the Bible we have versions of the Bible many and we bring them to church and we study the Bible and I'm not putting that down that's great someone said but after all is said and done a whole lot more is said than none says we're to walk in the truth so back years ago back in when I was a teenager there was this father who had a teenage son teenage son was 15 and he wanted to get his driver's license like a lot of boys my age that was the right of passage at least in my day every boy wanted to get his license when he turned 16 and so this boy said to his dad dad can I get my license when I turned 16 dad said well I'll tell you what you need to bring your grades up because you're not doing so well in high school so you have to have at least a 3.0 if you have a 3.0 when you turn 16 yes I'll let you get your license but there's two other things one you also", "have to clean your room and keep it clean cuz you don't will you do that I can do that sure okay and the third thing is and this was kind of the hardest one for the boy he had long hair now some of you you lived when I how many of you men my age I'm in my 60 how many of you had long hair at some point in your life guys and are willing to admit it okay the rest don't are lying but anyway um most not all of them but a lot of us had long hair anyhow this kid was one who did not want to cut his hair so his dad said the third thing you got to do is you got to get your haircut he goes what goes you got to do it you're not going to get your Okay so he's about to turn 16 and he comes to his dad and says Dad can I get my license my birthday's coming up he said well did you bring up your grades he said absolutely you can ask Mom I they just came the other day 3.2 and so Dad says mom she said it's right here goes great how about your room mom says he's been keeping it clean every day it's a miracle but he's been doing it and he goes okay he goes you didn't get your haircut you got to get your haircut goes come on dad boy goes even Jesus had long hair he goes he walked everywhere he too now I share that to say this the word walk in that culture had a totally different meaning than it does in ours why because we don't walk almost anywhere well some of us walk a little bit but Jesus walked everywhere literally I mean yes he's on a donkey one time on Palm Sunday you saywell what about that time he was in his mother's womb on the Way to Bethlehem I've seen the Christmas cards yeah that's not in the Bible Bible nowhere says Mary was on a donkey anywhere or that Jesus ever rote a donkey maybe he did he definitely is not on a camel he's not in a walked he occasionally rode in a boat sometimes he even walked on the water he walked everywhere and so the term in the ancient world it is the means of transportation for everybody in Israel they didn't have horses they weren't allowed to have horses they didn't have Uber lift you walked and because everybody walked everywhere it meant to live out the Christian Life in", "every aspect of your life not just at church not just when you're with Christians but it needs to affect the way you live when you're at work when you're at school when you're by yourself self at home walking the Bible says since we're children of God we should walk in love in the book of Ephesians there are these three guys talking about their Bibles you know Christians like to argue about everything and they were arguing what's the best translation of the Bible this one guy goes it's King James for sure King James stood the test of time since 1611 still the best translation H it's good enough for Paul it was good enough me Paul had nothing to do with that okay um the second guy goes oh I like the new living trans Greg Lorie likes that one and it's really modern translation it's easy to understand third guy says none of those are the best translation the best translation in the Bible he said it with authority is my grandmother's Translation your grandma's translation Bible what what's what's that goes she translated the Bible into her life oh yeah hard to argue that one dl Moody the great evangelist of the 1800s said every Bible should be bound in shoe in other words you should be reminding yourself this is how I'm to live not just what I'm to love not just what I'm going to say I believe but it should be demonstrated remember in the Book of James James I've shared this many times but if you've never heard me say it James mentions three different kinds of Faith he mentions faith without works which he says is what there's dead Faith the person who says they believe but they don't do anything then there's demonic Faith he says the demons believe and they tremble they believe there's a God in fact the demons have the best theology in the New Testament of anybody did you know that when they see Jesus they don't question who he is we know who you are the Holy One of they know exactly who he is they're not saved so there's dead Faith there's demonic Faith but there's also in the Book of James Dynamic faith that Faith whereby you live it out and that reality of it well some of you know the name some of you don't it's just a name to you but for me he was a guy I went and actually heard in person here in Fullerton actually Keith Green who was a musician and a speaker and a kind of a Christian artist but sort of a prophet", "in his day calling the Church of the 1980s to repentance and to move away from what was then and still is easy believism easy believism is that teaching you just need to pray the prayer and you're going to go to heaven doesn't really matter how you live your life as long as you got your fire Insurance you're good to go and so he was calling the church to obey the word of God not that we're saved by works but that the reality of living faith has to be demonstrated and he sang many powerful songs before the Lord took him home in the in a in a plane crash he and his sons went home uh to be with the Lord there in Texas but here in around 1981 he he did this song and it was uh basically the words right out of Matthew 2 most of it is just right from scripture it's one of the things I loved about his some of his songs it's called the sheep goat judgment and I want to read it to you the words will be familiar he's added a few words that are to make it a little more interesting but let me read it he said and when the son of man comes and all the Holy Angels with him then he shall sit on his glorious Throne he'll divide the Nations before him as a Shepherd separates the sheep from the goats it's right out of Matthew 25 and he shall put the sheep on his right the goats on his left and he shall say to the Sheep Come Ye blessed of my father inherit the Kingdom that I have prepared for you from the foundation of the world for I was hungry you gave me something to eat I was thirsty you gave me something to drink I was naked and you clothed me a stranger and you invited me in I was sick and I was in prison and you came to me thank you enter into your rest and they shall answer him and they'll say uh Lord when when when were you hungry Lord and we gave you something to eat when were you thirsty I I can't remember and we gave you a drink when were you naked Lord and we clothed you and Lord when were you a stranger and we invited you in I mean we invited lots of people in Lord but I I would never forget that face and Lord when were you sick and we visited you or in prison and We Came To You Lord tell us in as much as you've", "done it to the least of these my brethren you've done it unto me then he shall turn to those on his left the goats depart from me you cursed ones into Everlasting fire prepared for the devil and his angels for I was hungry you gave me nothing to eat I was thirsty and you gave me nothing to drink I was naked out in the cold in exposure and you sent me away I was a stranger I knocked at your door but you didn't open you told me to go away I was sick I was racked in pain on my bed I begged and I prayed and I pleaded that you'd come but I was in prison and I rotted there I prayed that you'd come I I heard your programs on the radio I read your magazines but you never came depart from me wait Lord wait there must be some mistake when Lord I mean when were you hungry Lord and we didn't give you something to eat Lord when were you thirsty and we didn't give you a drink I mean that's not fair well would you would you like something now would one of the Angels like to go out and get the Lord a hamburger and a coke oh oh you're not hungry yeah I lost my appetite too oh Lord uh when were you naked I mean Lord that's not fair either Lord we didn't even know what size you were oh Lord when were you a stranger Lord you weren't one of those creepy people who used to come to the door were you Lord that wasn't our ministry Lord we we just didn't feel led you know or when were you sick what did you have anyway H well at least it wasn't fatal was I'm sorry Lord I would have sent you card Lord just on one last thing we want to know when were you in prison Lord I mean what were you in for anyway I mean I I had a friend in lorth enough in as much as you've not done it to the least of my brethren you've not done it to me and as much as you've not done it under the least of my brethren you've not done to me depart from me these will go away into Everlasting fire but the righteous into eternal life and then he says this and my friends the only difference between the sheep and the goats according to the scripture is what they did and didn't do it's the only difference in this passage what they did and what they didn't", "do Jesus never told his disciples to want to wash one another's feet he just told them to do it why I think it's because what you practice becomes a part of you jot down 1 Thessalonians 4: 9 and 10 here's what Paul says 1 Thessalonians 4 now as to the love of the Brethren you have no need for anyone to write to you to write to you for you yourselves are taught by God to love one another for indeed notice you practice it toward all the Brethren who are in all Macedonia but we urge you Brethren to excel still more Jennifer Aniston said while she was still taping the series that when the show Friends would end it's long run on television she will miss character and then she said in many ways Rachel has become part of her practice to sit stop waiting for some great desire to come over you to obey the Lord now I have people and I'm so grateful don't get me wrong and don't misunderstand me who come to me and will say things like since I've been coming to the church I really started learning the Bible and I'm so blessed to learn scripture and I am glad too sometimes people have never read their Old Testament and they're learning to see Jesus in the Old Testament or learning what the scriptures mean as we go verse by verse through it there's nothing wrong with being blessed to spend time in God's word Psalm 1 says how blessed is the man who who actually meditates in the law of God day and night it'll be like a tree planted by the rivers of water bring forth its fruit and its season and won't wither it is a blessing to know and learn and meditate on God's however let's remember that Jesus did not say if you know these things blessed are you he didn't say that he said if you know these things blessed are you if you you what do them the blessing comes doing them remember James talks about the person who deceives thems who hears the word of God enjoys the word of God learns things from the word of God but never actually obeys the word of God he said don't be deceived don't be a hearer of the word it's like a person who goes in front of a mirror and they see something wrong and they just don't they yeah there it is I can see it glad I saw it and they walk out they never take care of it how weird would that be you got broccoli in your", "teeth like oh I shouldn't Smile as Big I'm just going to leave deal with it be a doer of the word not a hearer who themsel I believe the walk that we're to have is to walk in truth and to walk in love and it has to be balanced now let me just encourage you some take-home stuff some stuff that can start right the we could talk about lots of stuff let's just talk about a couple number one if you are in this relationship with someone who has hurt you or you've hurt them take the initiative today this week to restore a broken relationship now some of you are going I don't really have anybody but somebody's coming to M right now so if somebody's coming to your mind yeah I'm talking about that person I'm actually talking about you take the initiative to restore a broken relationship you say Pastor you don't understand it's all their fault perfect that's even better that's exactly what the Lord did with you he restored a relationship with you by taking the initiative exactly right you want to be like Jesus not anymore not no not really not today not in that kind of way but here's what Jesus said if you remember as you're worshiping the Lord someone has ought against you someone's got a problem with you yeah is there a problem they've got got it it doesn't matter how they got it someone's bugged someone's hurt someone's offended someone's not talking to you drop your gift don't bother worshiping me God says go get restored with your brother or sister then come worship it's got to be at the top of the things to do list even more than worshiping God that's what he said maybe you need to forgive somebody who's hurt you God says I'm going to hold up on restoring our relationship till you restore the one with them what that's what he said if you won't forgive your brother from the heart neither will I forgive you that's how important so take the inititive to restore a broken relationship and then secondly may say Bob I don't have that problem you will someday so store that away but some of you do decide to Grace someone unexpectedly Grace is always unmar favor it's giving somebody something they don't expect don't deserve um you know we love to give good gifts to our children yesterday I was in Walmart looking at bicycles with my grandson you'll never guess his name anyway he's six and he wants a bike and uh I said well Christmas is", "coming he goes well okay so we went over there look at bikes they're all locked up you can't even get on them now cuz I guess thieves come in and grab them and drive through the store and run out I don't know but you got to get somebody to help you took 30 minutes till somebody had the key we were sitting there in front of the bikes also we could see which size would fit him finally we got the bike and he sat on it it was unlocked I said why don't you ride it down to the to the carpet cleaning area where I'm going next you know why don't you write oh I can't I can't cuz there you got to put it back and you know we're not buying it right now I go how do you know he looked at me he he goes for Christmas I go maybe just because I love you oh do you know he his eyes got so big but do you know my heart got so full I love giving him gifts can I tell you something grace is giving people things they don't deserve they didn't earn they're not expecting you can do that with people here or people that you know it doesn't have to be a Christian it can be anybody giving them something that they're not EXP did you notice how often Jesus did it with words he would say wonderful things about people the Bible says gracious words fell from his lips people love to listen to Jesus you would have loved him you say I already do you would have loved listening to him because of the way he treated people and the way he treated you people who didn't deserve it Jesus not only accepted Sinners who other people rejected but he'd say things about people that nobody else would say it Jesus said things for instance about John the Baptist now everybody agreed he was a prophet but Jesus goes farther he said he's the greatest of men born of women it's like wow that's quite a statement I say to myself wait a minute Jesus you were born I that's going way out there the greatest of men born of women and more prophet Jesus twice with two different Gentiles one a man a centurion one a woman a sar Phoenician woman said things about their faith I haven't seen such great faith and all of Israel that I see guy he marveled at their faith really did he was impressed with their faith when's the last time you told somebody", "I'm impressed with your faith I'm blown away at you know I I it was uh a few years ago now A friend of mine his name is Mike actually was part of this church when it started in my home um he's he's in heaven now but he was attending our church sat in the back row every Sunday and I happen to run into him at uh world best hamburgers no wood I guess they weren't world's best because they went out of business but anyway right across the way and I went in there after church on Sunday and he was in line and I was in line he had just been here and he said Bob copy it's good to see you I go hey Mike how are you we're old friends and he he said this to me he said when you preach God Smiles that's all he said and I'll never forget that he wasn't trying to flatter me and say you have five bucks can you cover my bill no he just he didn't need that but did it bless me well I guess so you share with people encourage them you know well sometimes the best way to just bless them is just listen to them you know the definition of a gossip is somebody who talks about others the definition of a bore is somebody who thems the definition of a brilliant conversationalist is somebody who talks about you just listen to them ask them questions about themselves you know the story is told of a person that stuck their head in right about now at the end of the service walked into somebody in the back row and they said is it all done the person said hardly it's just all been said now we got to go do it that's what it's about we learn things all Lord I'm gonna I want to apply this today I want to start doing it I want to live out my faith in the truth and my love for people in a balanced way to bring you glory let's pray father easier to hear a sermon than to live

really done that yourself I encourage you I challenge you do that with your family on the way home do it with a friend here just gather maybe you say well Bob my bigger heart and concern is about my children when you talk about having joy that your children are are walking in the truth and I you're you would honestly say none of my children are walking in the truth well then then if they're working on their testimony why don't you work on being a part of asking God to change them and prepare you to be a part of that change and even sharing that with some friends here that that's on your heart whatever's on your heart let people bear your burdens and fulfill the law of Christ it's a joy to be with you God bless have a great", "now but what he's done for us eternally so lord we're thankful to be here we're thankful that we get to see beautiful things happen in your name we see bonds they'll hold into addiction people on the verge of something terrible in their life and you pull us back from the brink but lord we want to focus in our reason to praise always and that's because number one you're worthy of it we can sing over and over and over and never encapsulate how glorious and powerful you are but then also because our testimony demands it that we serve a god so gracious so awesome so wonderful if we're not dead you're not done as we just say i mean we do believe greater things are are still to come but lord we know that also eternity we will have eternal life that starts now and so we want to look forward to worshiping you perfectly in heaven but we know that you've called us to today and so help us to not anything that you are do or we want to lay ourselves on the altar and we can sing hallelujah a thousand times ten thousand times a million times but until our heart actually means it um well that's what you want from us and help us to pour out our praise to you out of a heart full of abundance of gratitude and worship to you in jesus the honor and the rest lord jesus this song is who else would die for our redemption but i have eternity to try to the king of heaven we will sing forever we will see and the praise lord jesus this song is i'll carry a bird laying it down and i know that you saw my condition i can't comprehend long before my so we if there's time can you just all come close yeah come up to the front we're gonna sing is he worthy and uh we haven't done that in a while is he worthy yeah so you guys sound amazing tonight by the way and if you're here for the first you know um i love worshiping with you guys you know what i'm really glad about i don't i don't get to just do it on earth i get to do it forever and i was thinking about that yeah you guys are gonna have to get uh let these folks in the back get up so you're gonna have to kind of go into the rows probably because we don't want everybody in the back just come up as close as you can so we can hear each other", "because i wanna see your faces i wanna i wanna i wanna hear us you're saying you know what i was thinking as we were worshiping tonight i was thinking lord if it's this awesome and this is just a rehearsal what's it gonna be like when we're singing and he's right in front of us you guys face to face can you imagine that's gonna happen that's that's ahead of us guaranteed we're gonna be there worshiping our savior and it's for a lot we've spent more time on this earth than we're gonna have to again before we're with him and man it's just coming so i i want us to figure out where raymond ditched me too oh he's there he's figuring it out okay cause i i didn't where are you he's been he's been translated tell a joke i am a joke okay well i'm not going to lead an acapella because i love you too much to make you enjoy that but there's this song you know the i first heard it when we um yeah it's coming during coven when you guys weren't here when i had pictures on the chairs and our worship actually i don't remember jeremy camper who wrote it but just ministered to my heart because it just focuses on who jesus is simple song if you haven't heard it you'll catch it more suspense this way do you feel the world has broken you do you feel the shadows deepen but do you know that all the dark won't stop the light from getting do you wish that you could see it on me is new creation coming it's the glory of the lord to be the light within our minds is he worthy and there's jesus does our god he's made us is he worthy i i would have been okay if the rapture happened we sang that last note in heaven that would have been

relationship with the lord so please go on the app find out more about those a week from um this saturday we're going to invite you to go on a walk a prayer walk and for those of you that can and this particular one this first one we're going to do we'll be out in riverside at an abortion clinic and we're beginning as a church just starting this sunday to embrace a brand new ministry called love life and it is a pro-life ministry where we are going to call you to pray at times to fast as a church and then to be a part of really having your presence known and praying over the people that um are thinking about or deciding to end a life in a pregnancy but this is different than a lot of us have done protests and stuff like that before this is gonna be different uh our focus we're really going to seek to love them but to by god's work minister to their hearts um i'll just tell you about one family that went out a few weeks ago was part of a prayer walk at an abortion clinic and the group those out there were praying there were people ministering to the people that were driving in you can't go into the parking lot and it's not harassing anybody it's not calling names it's not really petitioning but just praying and they saw four different people women that had come in evidently to have a either counseling or an abortion who decided they didn't want to be there and drove away never even went in and i i'm going to tell you something there are churches all over the country that are starting to embrace this ministry we're actually the first one in orange county but we're not the first church in southern california jack hibbs church is doing some some others but we believe god's gonna do a work in california this sunday i'm gonna step out while i'm done with first peter so", "i'm gonna step in between the two books i'm gonna teach the right to life or sanctity of life and what god's word has to say about that and so i want you to be here sunday it's uh i don't typically share messages like that but it's time to do that so i'm super excited but we'll talk to you and tell you more and on sunday about that saturday uh prayer walk the next week out in riverside now one other the word um we have a homeschool ministry in our church for uh parents who are wanting to do homeschooling we have quite a few and we are doing something for the first time we've ever done um starting in a couple of weeks here we're going to have some homeschool classes um that are taught by teachers here on campus on mondays and we have i think already about 70 kids signing up to come so it's pretty exciting we weren't sure we'd have enough time to we just started this a few weeks ago it was late notice but the lord is blessing it a lot of interest so two things if you are a homeschool parent and you think you might be interested in enrolling your child in our home school teaching time you want to go on the app and get that done asap but we are in need i just found this out today one of the teachers has some emergencies in their family with their parents and will not be able to teach so we are looking for an elementary level teacher who things first through third and grades and its history and by the way you don't have to be a history major to teach elementary school history you will have to be ready yeah but it's not like most of you in this room would be capable of actually doing that so if you're interested in helping us we do have a need we have students but right now we don't have a teacher so we've got to plug the right person we believe god's gonna provide if you think you might be interested let me know and i'll i'll give you the resource afterwards the referral who you need to talk to we would love to see if that's something the lord would use you to do well not for the last time but for the last time in this study i want you to open up to leviticus chapter 27 that's the last chapter of that book so leviticus 27 and we're gonna overview the chapter but we'll jump into", "some sections so that you get the taste of the whole thing leviticus 27 moses writes this again the lord spoke to moses saying speak to the sons of say to them when a man makes the king james has a singular vow but the word power means difficult or hard when a man makes a difficult vow he shall be valued according to your evaluation of persons belonging to the lord if your valuation is of the mail from 20 years even to 60 then your evaluation shall be 50 shekels of silver after the shekel of the sanctuary or if it's a female then your valuation shall be 30 shekels if it'd be from five years of age even to 20 your valuation for the male is 20 and for the female 10 but if they are from a month even to five years old then your valuation shall be five shekels of silver for the male and for the female your valuation shall be three shekels of silver if they are from 60 years old and upward if it's a male then your valuation shall be 15 shekels for the female 10 but if he is poorer than your valuation then he shall be placed before the priest priest shall value him according to the means of the one who vowed and the priest shall value him father we don't understand everything that you put in this book but we know it's here for us to read and to be encouraged sometimes to get a warning sometimes to get educated as to how to relate to you and so tonight would you give us eyes to see what you have for this church this part of your bride here in southern open our eyes to see wonderful things from your law they're here but we need your help to see him in jesus name we pray amen you can be seated the book of leviticus was as the title is written to the tribe of levi about how to approach a holy god and most of the book deals with obligatory sacrifices how do you come before a holy god how do you honor god how do you deal with sin and so we've studied it and then this last chapter is actually completely different than all the other 26 chapters because chapter 27 is actually talking about a completely obligated something that is up to you the psalmist said what shall i give unto the lord for all he's done for me and that really becomes the natural desire of somebody who's been saved that desire to say lord i want to", "i want to bless you i want to honor you and sometimes because of that we'll make commitments to the lord that aren't required of us but really just come from our hearts and of course those are sometimes i think the purest gifts that when we say i don't have to do this i really want to do it for you and that's a gift to god but sometimes we can also make commitments to the lord in a moment of excitement or whatever and then realize well what did i say oh did i say i was going to do that and we make vows to the lord or people can make vows to the lord and i think sometimes satan really doesn't have to even convict us of some sin that we're in he just reminds us of promises we made i'll never miss another day of church and i'm golfing or whatever and i suddenly he just i'm going to read through the whole bible this year and you know you started out well in genesis one and two first few days of january when you're off work and then suddenly you hit numbers or whatever and slowed down a bit and now you've got several books of the bible to make up and i'm gonna go away for a weekend and make it up you know and you made this commitment god never demanded it of you but you did it well this chapter is about voluntary commitments but i've entitled it holy his for a reason because it's about yourself and those things that are in to the lord so i want to talk to you about that from the principles that are here in these different sections first of all put this down learn to dedicate precious people to god valuable or precious people now it's interesting to me in the text in verse two he says speak to the sons of israel and say to them when a man makes you might underline it a difficult vow a difficult vow meaning a commitment that's going to be hard to live out jot down exodus 24 3. we've already studied the book of exodus a while ago but here's what the bible says after god gave his law to his people remember the ten commandments you find in exodus chapter come on someone knows it 20 and we're in 24 here exodus 24 verse 3 after he had already given the commands then moses came recounted to the people all the words of the lord and all the ordinances and all the people with one voice", "all the words which the lord has spoken i don't really say it but like we just did we're gonna do everything god told us to do that's how they felt that day i'm sure they met it and the rest of the old testament records the fact that they utterly and completely failed that commitment to the lord it's easy to make a commitment to the lord many times it's hard to live it out jot down romans 12 you know this verse i urge you therefore brethren by the mercies of god paul says in light of everything he's done for you chapters 1 through 11 to present your body your life a living and holy what sacrifice acceptable to god which is your spiritual service of worship so as believers we don't offer up animals we don't bring a cow or a you know a goat or a sheep to a church to offer up to the lord we don't do that we our sacrifice is jesus but there are spiritual sacrifices we're to make and paul says in light of all that he's already done for you now give your entire life to the lord as a living unlike other sacra they're all dead a living sacrifice and remember that old saying about living sacrifices the problem with a living sacrifice is it tends to crawl off the altar meaning i give my life to the lord but then i can easily take it back put this down dedicate yourself to the lord he's talking in our text he in verse 2 of persons belonging to the lord please remember who's involved here these are people that are saved they got saved out of egypt right they're on they've heard from god they've seen god's presence they've seen god's provision they're going to the promised land they are they are in a sense a parallel to us we're saved we're maturing with lord he's revealing his word to us but there's a need to know about how to dedicate ourselves to may i say to you i believe there's a crossroads in every single one of our christian lives that deals with this as much as you can be surrendered to the and i pray you'd say i am i'm not perfect i didn't ask you if you're perfect because if you said you were you'd be lying you wouldn't make that you wouldn't be perfect anyway you're not in heaven yet i'm asking you if you're surrendered are you consecrated have you devoted yourself you said god i want you to have all that i am or are you struggling with stuff in your life", "that you not sure you trust god with some relationship some habit some pursuit that you know is between you and god this is an important issue for every christian i remember in the old after a battle saw this egyptian slave of an amalekite or he wasn't a malachite but a slave of an egyptian and he asked him a question he said to this man to whom do you belong to whom do you belong i think that's a good question for every one of us who claim to be christians to ask ourselves to whom really do you belong can you say with the bride and the song of solomon concerning the lord jesus i am his and he is mine i'm my beloveds i heard of a pastor that was preaching about how we are called to be soldiers in an army paul talks to timothy about that remember suffer hardship as a good soldier of jesus christ a good soldier doesn't entangle himself in the things of everyday affairs so he might please the one who entrusted it enlisted him as a soldier we're part of an army together and he gave this whole message and at the end that was one of those churches where the people file out there's only one way out by the pastor's hand you ever been to a church like that i grew up in one you have to shake his hand you're not going to get by and so you know so that these two men he had never seen them before they're visitors so he's he's talking to the people and finally these guys come up and he says to the first guy he says glad to have you here he goes i have a question for you are you guys in the lord's army they go yes we are he goes how come i never he said we're in the secret service we used to sing a song years ago called i'm yours remember that i'm yours lord everything i've got everything i am and everything i'm not i'm yours lord try me now and see see if i can be completely there was a pastor and this christian man next to him and they were out of dinner and he turned over to this pastor he said i've got a question for you do you believe that christian young people should seek to do something for the lord he said no he said you don't he said no i believe that you should do everything for the lord which describes you put this down dedicate all you will do", "to the lord all you will ever do to the lord that's what the bible says in corinthians whatever you do to the glory of god now the first thing that strikes anyone who reads this is well this is a little weird there seems to be a difference in valuation of the men and i mean why are the guys more valuable than the women please understand this has nothing to do with a person's worth the bible is very clear about that live with your wives according to knowledge this is first peter 3 and grant her honor values the word tomorrow it's over the word timothy by the way grant her honor as a fellow heir of life lest your prayers be hindered god says hey guys if you don't treat your wife like she's a spiritual equal i won't be listening to your prayers there's no question that we are all created in the image of god this has nothing to do with the person's god it has to do with a person's work capacity i don't know how many of you ever saw the movie it was about the 911 compensation fund and for the 3 000 people that were killed on 911 the government having to some basis for giving those families who had lost a loved one and the people who didn't lose loved ones but were affected by it uh compensation it's like 9.6 billion dollars that has been paid out but how do you how do you do that how do you differentiate that had a lot to do with this issue of their capacity for earning and money that would have been earned during their lifetime now it's interesting just to look at the first one it speaks of men at that age 20 to 50 or 20 to 60 i guess 50 shekels of silver by the way that would have been about four years worth of wages that's a lot of money and that's very interesting to me that the the cost of a dedicated life is very now remember what jesus said no one who's going to build a tower just starts building it that he doesn't first sit down and kind of calculate can i finish it because if you don't take time to figure out if you've got enough money coming in and you can afford the increase in labor costs and construction costs in the 21st you're gonna look like a fool because you're gonna only have a partially built tower that's stupid you're gonna count she said uh no one who's gonna go to battle if you've got ten thousand troops", "and your enemy's coming with twenty thousand hey you better sit down and figure you think you could beat them you you better get your generals together so how i can we with ten beat the guy with twenty we better go make peace with them jesus said you to count the cost he said nobody can be my disciple who does not get rid of all of his possessions now you say what i have to get rid of all my possessions you have to declare yourself and see him as the owner there's a lot of christians that have never read that verse like i don't want to read that first you know um the bible says in ephesians 2 10. if you're a christian and many of you are i don't know that all of you are that we believers were created in christ jesus unto good works that god prepared beforehand that we should walk in them there is a life that god has called us to live from the time we're saved until the time where we see him face to face to bring him glory our capacity to bring honor to him and it'll affect all of eternity and i believe this is really the picture of that we are to dedicate all we will ever do for the to the lord put this down number three see value in dedicating every age and every stage of life i don't know if you looked at the list but it didn't matter what your gender was how old you were how young you were every age and every stage of life so if you're a young person there's a few of you here maybe in you know in our high school room or junior hiring tonight you need to say lord i want my youth to be used for your glory it's too often we do well when i'm older maybe god will use me that's a big god can use you right now there's all kinds of places in the bible where god uses a young person in a unique way we'll talk about that in a couple weeks when we start into the book of numbers by the way we're going to do them somebody are you going to do the book of numbers and i've read a few of those my answer to the question am i going to do the book of numbers is you can count on it yes i am going to do the number god's going to minister to our hearts i believe by faith i know that i've read some of it but um", "god can do things right now in your life that he may not do later that's why paul says timothy let your youth be an example right now this is a young you're young you're single yes someday i'll get married and then i'll have a normal life what listen can i remind you there are two gifts there's marriage and singleness they're both gifts when when i was young we had this wrong idea that marriage was a gift singleness was called a gift but it was one of those gifts you kind of want to where it was kind of like god said like it was a curse nobody wanted it i don't want to be and the people that got blessed were the people that got the marriage gift and you got a rock and you got that's how we used to look at it you go read first corinthians 7 you will find every single person in this room listen to me has the gift of singleness what doesn't mean you're never going to i don't know some of you might not and some of you may have been married but if you're single right now it's your gift use it for the glory of god with undistracted devotion to the lord paul said that's what i want if you do not want to be single god hasn't made you to be fulfilled in that then god has a plan he may not be moving as quickly as you'd like him to go back and read genesis and how god used that time to get adam to realize i can't find her then god would have said that's because she's not there but god finally put him to sleep first god used general anesthesia thankfully because he was going to do some removal and they he got adam ready but the point is listen don't be discouraged about god's timing there's a reason for it maybe that person that you want to come into your life today if they came into your life today they'd be terribly not ready you they're not cooked enough yet they're not ready you know they're not in the right shape for you i don't mean physically skinny or fat i mean they're just not the right person yet maybe they're not walking with the lord right now or maybe they are and you're not really the right person yet for them god knows trust him if you're single it's a gift there's a unique time in your life maybe before married and after married again you're going to be single see it", "as a gift my point is every stage every you're older you're retired now great use that for the glory of god there's things that can happen now in your life you need to see that at every stage and age of life there is a value to it according to scriptures so i don't know what stage you're in right now but it also tells me that there are people in our life at different ages and stages that god wants us to dedicate that relationship to the lord one of the things i learned as a young christian that i think every christian needs to hear understand and practice is that you've given your life to christ but the lord wants you to give relationships to him as well and i think a lot of christians don't really know that this is possible the dedicating of a relationship to the lord just like you invited christ to come into your life you can ask the lord to come in and be the center of your friendship with somebody who's a christian or to be the center of your relationship obviously with your girlfriend or boyfriend or your spouse or if you have a christian boss you you could where you have a son or a grandchild or whatever we need to learn to make the lord the center of our most precious relationships remember it's hannah in the old testament that gives birth finally to sammy samuel names him samuel because his name means asked of the lord in other words answer i asked for the lord i was barren and god opened my womb and i made this decision lord if you'll give me a son i'm going to dedicate him to you remember and she literally does dedicate her son to the lord not just like in general how the lord is yours he she dropped him off at the bye he's three years old i love you i'm sure they're crying he's going to serve the lord i mean literally she dedicated him and gave him to the lord's service and god did an incredible work in his life my mom i shared the story so i won't share it all tonight but my mom didn't tell me uh that she had dedicated me uniquely to the lord when the day i was born which was a long time ago but at the time when she told me it hadn't been that long but i was in my probably 20s and she told me yeah the day you were born i i felt like i needed to she i was her fifth child and", "she had been so blessed she wasn't even thinking about this but on the sheet to be admitted to the hospital to give birth to me it asked how many live births have you had i don't know if they always still ask that but they asked her that and and so she she had already had four live births and she realized that she knew people and their women certainly still are but in the 50s who sometimes their babies are still born and the babies don't survive and so she just reported down she had four live births and and she realized wow i mean i've been blessed i don't know what's going to happen with this one and so before she she kind of made her just say thank you to god and she said you know lord if you'll give me just one last one this this one i'm just totally dedicating to you she made this commitment and then she never bothered to tell me never mentioned i thought she forgot and after the lord called me out of police work to go into be a pastor and felt the call of the lord i reported to my parents i feel called to go into the ministry my mom was i should tell you and i had no idea that god was honoring her prayer and my point is this you and i need to see we need to see the value of dedicating relationships lord i've seen friendships completely turn around because two christians who struggled with their friendship competition and literally that relationship get redeemed and used for god's glory in a way that never could happen because of the decision to say jesus will you be the center of this relationship i want to challenge some of you who've never done that in your marriage to say let's do that he said how do you do it well how did you receive christ well i pray to receive the lord you sit together hold hands if you want hopefully your friends bleed enough to do that and ask the lord to be the center of your marriage to bring glory to him to direct it to be the bond that holds you guys together that your goal is no longer to get the other person to respect you and love you and give you what they should be giving you but together your goal is to glorify god and you'll find that as you seek the lord together guess what's going to happen you're going to get closer to each other it's the old tr some of you", "have heard this this whole triangle thing you're at one end with your spouse or the other person your friends on the you seek each other you'll never really it'll never work but if you seek the lord together the distance between you on that triangle gets smaller and smaller and smaller put him at the center ask him pray with the person don't just say well i couldn't have done that to my on my own no do it you'll it'll change your life we are to dedicate our path to the lord the bible says and our plans you say what are you talking about remember proverbs three five and six you know that verse you memorize that one on the bottom of the in and out cup trust in the lord with all your heart lead not on your own understanding in all your ways know the lord literally hebrew ya acknowledge him and he will what he'll make your path a well-trodden path is what the hebrew says he'll make he'll direct your paths or he'll make your path straight but you need to bring god into your planning i need your wisdom to keep me from the wrong way and put me on the right path i can tell you what i think the right path that sees the problems a lot of times i'm telling god hey here's what we need to do and god's going yeah i'm not listening because you have no idea what's coming you just think you know what's best today was uh almost uh well he was called up for jury duty so he was down at the court and so he called me on he goes i'm on recess i go play on the monkey bars i'm anyway so we do that anyway he uh he i said how's it going he goes well i'm number 18 and and they're they're going through you know you got 12 plus four alternates or something so i go ah you're gonna fake it you're gonna get they gotta knock some of those people out it's gonna be you he goes well this this is gonna be a couple weeks this trial and i said well let's have fun you know and uh of course you know everybody's hoping that if the lord wants him to be there uh he'll submit but uh so i was thinking about it because i thought man i can share and i did i shared with them a few things that might be truthful you don't lie you know um i hate judges and defense attorneys you know you just", "they'll keep you anyway uh but i was sharing with him because i've been through a bunch of times and usually when they find out i've been a police they finally said we don't want you the d.a says i would love you to stay but the defense won't keep you and so i get kicked out every time but my son's never been a cop and saying my dad used to be a cop that ain't going to cut it so he goes you know if i have to if i have to stay i'm fine i'm not going to be dishonest i'd go good and then i started thinking lord i want to pray that he doesn't have to serve but for all i know that jury needs a christian if there's no other one on this jury and that guy or whoever the girl they need justice and i don't know a better person than my son to give a heartfelt honest you know verdict than that and he's the judge but i i thought lord i might be praying the wrong prayer about my son i know what i want i wanted to come back and come back to work and be here and be in the cafe guess what he got booted not because he said anything weird just because it wasn't the lord's will my point is i'm praying for my will and i realize oh god your will might be completely different i need your wisdom and then james talks to us about really dedicating our plans to the lord not just our path but our plans shut it down james 4 verses 13 through 16. you know this verse come now james says you who say today or tomorrow we're going to go to such and such a city spend a year there engage in business make a buck yet you don't even know what your life will be like tomorrow you're just a a vaper peers for a little while and vanishes away what you ought to say is if the lord wills we will live and we'll also do this or that but as it is you boast in your arrogance all such boasting is evil in other words bring god into your path i don't know the right way to go god you do so i'll ask you but you make the decision and how about your plans don't make plans without god you know um years ago when my my sons were all grown and gone out of the house would come to me and want me to do some dad can we do", "this or dad can we go here or dad can we get a dog or whatever it was you know they would ask me for something and i would say you know um they would put pressure on me you know we gotta go we gotta just you know i'd say look if you have to know right this second the answer's no if you'll give me some time to pray about it i don't know what the answer will be oh take your time take your time because you see i don't want to just be making decisions based on my experience and what i want king of the house i don't know what the lord wants i really don't i need to ask him and god will show us but how many of us are just leaving the lord we're christians leaving the lord completely out of our plans though we don't ask them well say lord i i want to do your will and i might not be mine we need to dedicate every age every stage of life put this down let it be dedicate all your possessions or dedicate all you possess i guess is the word that you're filling in to to god all you possess it says now if it's an animal of the kind which men can present as an that one gives to the lord shall be holy he shall not replace it or exchange it a good for a bad or a bad for good if he does exchange an animal that he's dedicated for an animal then both it and its substitute shall become holy if however it is any unclean animal of the kind which men do not present as an the animal before the priest the priest shall value it as either good or bad as you the priest value it so it shall if you should ever wish to redeem it pay money so he could have it back from the lord then he shall add 20 one-fifth of it to your evaluation put this down determine all you have belongs to him all you own now let's remember that the children of israel had animals but their animals were not pets okay those are most of us those are the animals we have you know we have dogs and cats and birds and lizards and who whatever you have that was not what they when they were talking animals we're talking they had animals that were their their their herds that they were raising so these were their possessions actually the basis of their wealth and by the way", "for most of them not just their possession but their profession they were herdsmen they were sheep shepherds that's what they did and you think about this the lord wants us to give him our stuff but i mean does he really need our stuff there's an old there's no question years ago we used to ask you to christmas you know like what are you going to give god for christmas it's like what well it's i mean what do you give to the god who i mean think about it but jesus was born in a borrowed manger he preached from a he wrote into jerusalem about a borrowed and when he died he was buried in a borrowed grave that's an interesting thing to think about why would the king of the universe need a borrowed donkey when the bible says he owns all the cattle on a thousand hills i think it's because the lord's need remember what he said the lord has need of it but i'm borrowing it the lord's need is actually greatest privilege a person could ever have would be to give god something that he would use for his glory and he wants you to have that privilege i mean think about why why should the one who created every drop of water on the face of the earth say i'm thirsty to a woman at the well or to the crowd at the cross it's so that somebody might have the opportunity the privilege why did someone need to carry that cross well because it was too heavy for him can you imagine because the day the guy the guy the day the guy carried it he was not a happy camper it wasn't like what a privilege you know everybody else just gets the little ones around their neck i get the big one no no there was no privilege there it was shame reproach i don't know this guy but i believe that man came to christ i can show you why scripturally i believe can you imagine if he did looking back on that day the privilege he had that jesus needed someone to carry his cross the cross that he died for me on and there was only one person in all of human history that got to do that it was me i didn't even want to do it wow oh god wants you to give him your possessions but it's not because he needs them but it's because you need to discover the privilege of what he'll do with them put this down taking things back from god will cost you", "i don't know if you noticed in the text in verse 10 the person who's made a vow of an animal he shall not replace it or exchange it at a good one for a bad one or a bad one for a good one for if he does exchange an animal for an animal if you try to make a deal i'm gonna take that one back then both of them are holy both of them will belong to god in other words don't play games with god mcgee talks about having a guy in his church he was a farmer and he had gone out to the man's farm and the man said let me show you this calf i've dedicated it to the lord i'm giving it to the lord and he said he's it was a young baby calf he said it looked pretty weak kind of scrawny he said oh that's well months later that same calf became extremely healthy won a blue ribbon at the fair was worth all this money and the farmer said i've decided we're going to change that one out and he gave this other calf to the lord and you know what that's that's what this is talking about this idea of kind of changing i made this commitment to god but you know as it turns out i don't really want to live that out jot down malachi 1 and verse god has a problem with the priests in the book last book of the old testament cursed be the swindler who has a male in but sacrifices a blemished uh next slide because i can't remember the next word that's my guess anyway the i guess that verse stops right in the middle anyway basically it's this idea they made a commitment of of of a a sacrificial animal but then kind of brought in one that was lame or blind in fact god says to the people that are doing that why don't you offer that blind animal to your governor see if he'd be pleased with you in other words you offer me stuff that's defective and you don't think that it would offend me he said i am a i'm a great king i deserve respect i deserve honor and you're treating me without any respect so no substitutes allowed god said live out your vow ecclesiastes 5 5 is the classic verse about living out the vows you made here's what solomon wrote there it is better that you should not vow then you should vow and not pay there's the word animal somehow that we're back in malachi anyway", "ecclesiastes five five it's probably my fault i give him the verses blame me i'm sure it's my fault but the bottom line is this here's what ecclesiastes 5 5 says it's better to make no vow to god than to vow and not pay i think that offends sometimes well i meant well in my heart it was good that i wanted to give it to god listen if you just reapply that verse to let's say wedding vows well suddenly we go yeah that makes better to not make a vow of fidelity than to make it and not live it out hey man can i get an amen on that amen don't be vowing stuff and then not living it out god says don't do that to me don't tell me you're going to give me you're going to give me whatever it is that you're not even obligated to do it you're chosen to do it and then not live it out i will hold you to it no cheats no switcheroo there's an old saying you've heard it you can fool some of the people all the time and all the people some of the time but you can't fool all the people all the time actually the original saying goes further and says and you can't fool god any of the time you'll never pull the wall over god's it's it's foolish to have a commitment a dedication and then to take it back so let's make that practical you've dedicated yourself totally to the lord i hope you've already done that and i'm talking to a room full of dedicated people but the danger is you take it classic example of a person like that there's several in the bible but the one you've got to be thinking about is samson was as dedicated as you can get what was he a nazirite what's a nazarite not there one that is separated he was god had given this way whereby a parent in this case because they did it for him before he was born god said through an angel your son is going to be separated onto me collect my mom but god sent an angel didn't send an angel to my mom and didn't give her an angel either but anyway the fact is you are going to have a son and he's going to be great in the sight of the lord and the nazarite had certain rules they were never to touch a dead body they were never to touch anything to do with grapes or wine at all not just alcohol", "but no wine nothing like that they were to be completely they were never to cut and we remember that god anointed this little boy i mean i don't know if when because i mean i just picture him as a young man already just displaying this incredible strength he's like bam bam you know this is like you know i mean i don't know picking up the donkey and sweeping under i don't know what he did but he's just strong as an ox literally he was uh unparalleled in his physical strength because the lord's the lord was anointing him lord was on him but you read about this nazarite young man growing up who god is using to go out and fight the philistines and whoop them and i mean whoop them bad and yet the compromises that he starts i mean he is he goes through a vineyard no problem touching the carcass of the lion he's just violating every rule he's supposed to be honoring the only one that he didn't for a long time was he kept his beautiful hair and uh but he's compromising having sex with women he's not married to and the philistines they're the enemy and he's just all over the map disobeying god god's very patient but he finally compromises the secret of his own personal relationship with the lord it's as though he completely consecration to god his dedication to god and finally he wakes up literally to the presence of god is gone from his life he was so used to being able to compromise it nothing happened and you know you can get to a place where i'm the lords and i'm dedicated lord and i blow it here and i do this and i do that god forgives me it's all under the blood and i just go on with the lord and he uses me again be careful when god doesn't discipline his children it's never an endorsement of their compromise or sin it's proof of his mercy and patience and grace that should lead you to repentance the bible be careful with that and he wakes up after that third time asking him what the secret of his strength is and he finally tells her he's sick of her asking she's nagging him and he finally just breaks down and tells her he's got no power at all his strength is gone the philistines gouge out his eyes he's going to be blind till the day he dies which won't be too long from then by the way and they sh after he's got his hair is gone the commitment's gone", "he now has lost his freedom and he'll never regain it this is the way his life ends yes by faith god one last time gives him strength and he does take out the enemy and he gets in the book of hebrews because of his faith at the end of his life what a tragedy he has a picture of somebody who literally was totally dedicated to the lord god did great things but what might god have wanted to do with him had he lived out his dedication we'll never know we'll never know and you don't want a life like that you don't want to be somebody i used to be dedicated but no longer and put this down dedicate your places to god put in the word places beginning in verse 14. now if a man consecrates his as holy or set apart for the lord then the priest shall value it as either good or bad as the priest values it so it shall stand yet if the one who consecrates it should wish to redeem his house then he shall add one-fifth of your valuation price to it so that it may be again if a man consecrates to the lord part of the fields of his own property then your valuation shall be proportionate to the seed needed for it a homer of barley seed at 50 shekels of silver if he consecrates his field as of the year of jubilee according to your evaluation it shall stand if he consecrates his field after the jubilee however then the priest shall calculate the price for him proportionate to the years that are left until the year of jubilee and it shall be deducted from your valuation if the one who consecrates it should ever wish to redeem the field then he shall add one-fifth of your valuation price to it so that it may pass to him yet if he will not redeem the field but has sold the field to another man it may no longer be redeemed and when it reverts in the year of jubilee the field shall be holy to the lord like a field set apart it shall be for the priest as his property verse 22 or if he consecrates it to the lord a field which he has bought which is not a part of the field of his own property then the priest shall calculate for him the amount of your valuation up to the year of jubilee and he shall on that day give your valuation as holy to the lord let's just get an idea what i'm trying to say is you dedicate", "people first yourself people are able to be redeemed because they have value but they're to be dedicated to god then your possessions now we're talking about your house and your field so put this down dedicate your home and field to the lord so what do you mean jot down deuteronomy 20 in verse 5. this is when the army was going out to battle the officers were to come to the troops and before they would send them out to fight the enemy they were to go through this procedure the officers also shall speak to the people that men saying who is the man that has built a new house and has not dedicated it let him depart and return to his house lest he die in the battle and another man dedicated very interesting you would be released from service to go fight if you had not dedicated your house very we're also he has them also to do it with their field now you don't probably have a field some of you might but most of us don't i mean you live in the land of gracious living but some of us have zero lot lives and we have no fields and we're gonna have a front yard um but maybe i could ask it this way well what field are you in because you see as a christian have a sphere of responsibility in your life the things that you own yes but also the places you go your house that you actually live in but your job is usually the field you might say you're in or maybe you're in school a sphere of a place that you go we are to dedicate first of all it says your house and of course it's good to dedicate the house that god gives you but in the bible the word house usually has reference to what says unless the lord builds the they labor in vain who builds it unless the lord guards the city the watchman stays awake in vain it's vain to rise up early and retire late god gives to his beloved even in their sleep what's psalm 127 talking about construction guys that build houses go read psalm 127 128 you'll find it's all about the family all about the family unless the lord builds your family remember when the bible speaks of the house of david it's not talking about where he lived it's talking about the people that were part of his family that's why joshua at the end of his life said to the nation of israel listen you guys got to make a decision you either", "worship the gods that you used to worship in egypt or the gods of the amorites in the land to which you're going you got to make a decision or worship the lord but as for me and my family my house well we've already made our decision i've dedicated them we're going to serve the lord so i believe that dedicating your family your physical house yes but the field that god brings you to some of you you know you're working 40 50 hours a week someplace that's a place god wants the light to shine god don't just give me a paycheck out of here lord i want you to bring people to know you remember john four i'll never stop talking about this john 4 jesus sends his disciples into town they're on mission they've left their jobs to be in the ministry he sends them into town to buy bread to be a witness they come out with jesus meets a woman who isn't even sure who he is he just knows a lot about her miraculously could this one be the messiah i don't know runs into town after he reveals enough that she thinks he might be messiah because he said he was i who speak to you and he that's what he said he reveals himself after revealing that she's living with a guy had been married so you know he revealed enough that she realized there's something about him and she runs into town he just met her she's not even sure he's the messiah but she comes back with bread to meet jesus what a contrast why aren't the disciples bringing samaritans well they don't they don't really even want to be there to be honest with you if you know anything about the culture they would not have wanted to even go through it says in the king james he must needs go through samaria actually that's not true that he had to because most jews never did they wouldn't cross the jordan river over in this summer they would to go up north which is where he was but he had to go through i believe because he had an appointment with a woman who was going to lead to the salvation of souls in the city because those men are going to get saved and jesus is going to hang out with it's an amazing story but it also tells us if you go to work to get a paycheck that might you could go bring home the you might just bring home the bread you go to school to get a degree you'll", "probably get it hopefully you'll get it but if that's all you're getting you're missing the whole point of why you're you dedicate your time in school you dedicate your job lord i'm going in to be a reflection of you if i get i'll get paid too but that's not why i'm here it's not why i'm on the earth anymore dedicate your home your family your field to the lord then number two dedic or decide god sets the true value of things not man put in the word true man look at verse 25 again every valuation of yours moreover shall be after the shekel of the sanctuary god's house the shekel shall be 20 garrus now i just want you to notice that every valuation you make is going to be based on the valuation at my house this world does not the things that you should value the world does not value the cross the bible says the word of the cross to those who are perishing is foolishness but to us who are being saved it's the power of god that's first corinthians 1 18. our value systems are totally this world and progressively as we go year after year does not value the things that god values it does not value how do i know that because of how few people are getting married and those that do they don't value marriage because they ignore what god says about marriage fornication fornicators and adulterers god will judge the marriage bed is undefiled they don't honor marriage and sometimes those are even believers living together we're going to church no problem because the culture says it's okay well you know god doesn't who's what valuation are you going to use what the world says or what god says now you need to know what the word says it's obvious what the world says watch any tv show it's obvious this world does not value the role of fathers at all watch any sitcom he's the idiot who doesn't know what he's doing sometimes that's true but that's not the way god looks at the this world does not value the unborn is that obvious but you should come sunday we'll talk more about that and clearly god does decide god will set the true value of things not this world then put this down letter d you cannot gift god what you owe him put in the word gift and oh and look verse 26 and following a firstborn among animals which as a firstborn already belongs to the lord no man may consecrate it whether ox or", "sheep it it's art of the lord's but if it's among the unclean animals then he shall redeem it according to your evaluation and add to it 20 and if it is not redeemed then it shall be sold according to your evaluation nevertheless verse 28 anything which a man sets apart to the lord out of all that he has of man or animal or of the fields or of his own property shall not be sold or redeemed anything devoted to destruction is most holy to no one who may have been set apart among men shall be ransomed he shall surely be put to death thus all the tithe of the land of the seed of the land or of the fruit of the tree is the lord's it is holy to the lord if therefore a man wishes to redeem part of his tithe he shall add 20 for in other words the full valuation for every 10th part of the herd or flock whatever passes under the rod that the 10th one shall be holy to the he is not to be concerned whether it is good or bad nor shall he exchange it or if he does exchange it then both it and its substitute shall be set apart for god it shall not be redeemed these are the commandments which the lord commanded moses for the sons of israel at mount sinai now interesting whatever is set apart for the lord could not be sold or redeemed it had to be devoted to destruction now this we see in the book of joshua when the battle of jericho happens god said you're not to take any of this you are to burn it all their silver all their gold you just you burn it i don't want you keeping and who was it that decided he'd go and aiken would wind up aiken because he would get stoned to death i remember he thought it was a secret nobody knows what i'm doing and he went and grabbed some stuff out of the battle and hid it under his tent and then the children of israel after a huge victory tried to go take on a tiny little town thought no problem we don't even have to send the whole army up there and they go and they get and uh 36 men i believe get killed in the battle and they run from the battle and everybody's what's going on where's god why isn't he with us they've turned their backs to the enemy joshua says i and the lord says there's sin in the", "in other words you're not going to go you're not going to have victory as a while there's compromise nobody knew what it was well aiken did and his and so god says let's let's deal with it because we're not going any further into this problem you're going to have nothing but defeat until you deal with sin in the camp meaning in the nation of israel and so by lot they figure out which family it is which tribe it is and finally it lands on aitkin and he's called to repent of it admit what he had done that he had coveted this stuff and and as a result then he is actually stoned to death but it's interesting the things that were devoted to destruction could not be used so he winds up being devoted to destruction is what happens but put this down it's important the tithe was a debt that you see this let's say i owed you a hundred dollars i borrowed it promised to pay you and i needed it and so you were generous enough to give it to me and then i come on friday and i have this little gift wrap box with a card with your hundred dollars in there's something about that that just doesn't feel right you don't give a gift of what you oh that's not a gift until you give you more beyond is there something underneath here bob nope just your hundred bucks back hope you appreciate it i'd always pay people back that's a gift no you know i jot down malachi 3 verses 8 and nine will a man rob god you're robbing me god says but you say oh how have we robbed you god says in tithes and offerings you are cursed with a curse for you are robbing me he says the whole nation of you all of israel he says you are robbing me in other words the tithe this is a lot of us as christians do not understand this the tithe is actually not a gift when the israelis brought their tithe was not a gift it was their obligation by the way it wasn't 10 it was 20 to 30 percent that's it it always amazes me people get freaked out when they've never given anything to god you know a nickel here and a dime here i remember years ago this man was telling me because i saw i met this guy in the church it was our church and i don't know who the guy was but he was telling i couldn't believe it he goes you know he gives", "he tithes five percent of his income i didn't have the heart to tell him the word tithe means ten percent i just couldn't tell him he was so blown away that somebody would give five percent but the fact is the tithe in the old testament was not a gift years ago there was a bumper sticker that said hunk if you love jesus during the jesus movement a lot of christians had on the car and then honk and wave give the one way sign to other people hey they're believing they're the fish sticker you know somebody came up with a new i don't know why but they changed the sticker instead of saying hunk if you love jesus it said tithe if you love jesus any idiot can now i don't really think that was the right mentality but i think what they were saying is uh just get serious about fact is it's been said and it's true let me see your bank statement and your calendar and i can tell you what you worship that's true for anybody where do you spend your money where do you spend principles from the tithe in the old testament but we do not give under obligation if you give under obligation to some law you're not giving new testament giving final verse second corinthians 9 verses 6 and 7. listen to what paul says in the new testament about giving now this i say he who so sparingly he's talking about sowing seed shall reap sparingly he said if you give little don't expect much and he who sows bountifully shall also reap bountifully plant a lot of seeds a lot will come up let each one of you joe just as he's purposed in his own heart not grudgingly or under compulsion for god loves a cheerful giver the word cheerful in greek is hilarion it's where we get our word hilarious the idea is god wants you to enjoy it and it's totally up to you it's free will billy graham who many of you know that name said something about this area i don't have the quote so i want to leave look what he said he said this we have found in our own home that god's blessing upon the nine tenths the the in other words we give the tithe but what we have left over the god's blessing on the nine tenths we tithe helps it to go farther than ten tenths without his blessing which is an interesting statement but it's not because the tithe is an obligation on christians a lot of people only get that", "far they finally realize i'm going to trust god and start giving them the 10th praise god there's nothing wrong with that but i agree with this statement if the law demands the tithe and we're not under the law how could love offer anything less if you think about it it's kind of like lord i want my life to honor you i learned some principles from the tithe but i don't want to give myself some legalistic work well i'm do it like the guy who wouldn't home justified i tithe everything i have remember that guy hey this is not about you have to give 11 to be blessed no it's about this is not an area god wants to give you a rule because he doesn't want you to give because you have to or the bare minimum that you can give and still obey him he wants it you decide it's up to you he doesn't need your i've never heard a preacher say that he doesn't need your money he wants you but where your treasure is your heart is so you make the decision about that but i want to just challenge you encourage you to say lord i want you to have me i want you to have my relationships i want you to have every possession i have every place i go to work i want you to own my home lord i want to treat it like it's yours you said to write my word on the doorpost so people know this is your house this family is yours i want to honor you in the way that i live and and i want you to use everything that you have given me because ultimately i'm going to give it back to you soon anyway i i want to honor you and the money you give me because i want to trust you to to bless me and not just be what i can earn myself and save and you know i did it i did it my way no lord i want to do it your way and i want i want to be an of how a person can be blessed to trust are you his are you holy his and if you can't say yes to that then say lord tonight come and let's pray father we thank you for this study in leviticus lord finishing up this book i thank you for the lessons that are here about about being set apart for you about being used to represent you as priests lord you have opened our eyes to seeing", "the privilege we have to being on this face of this earth the people that you have called to to own to be your possession and that our inheritance is you lord we don't need anything on this earth how could we need anything else if we satisfy us with yourself and more thereof in jesus name we pray amen let's all stand and sing together the lord bless you my prayer is that the lessons that we learn the things that we look at go far deeper than a bible study if it's only for you to maybe say lord as you're getting ready to fall asleep tonight or in your car if you're on your or maybe your family to say are we completely his i mean we know we know he saved us but these people were saved and he was challenging them to say if you want you want to it's your choice you don't have to you can go through this life and you're going to go to heaven he's not going to keep heaven back because you don't totally surrender you're just going to miss out on all god wants to do in and through you and if you're saying i think i'm missing i i know that i am there's some things i need to let go of some parts of my life some attitude then just say god help me i don't know how to let go of it help me i i've got a withered hand i can't even offer it to you god make my hand work so i can offer it to you he will he's waiting for some of you to pray that prayer tonight to start a new work in your life if you want to go to the prayer room and make it official there do it but you don't have to you just do business with god let god start a new work tonight god", "i'd like you to open your bibles now to your favorite book i'm going to tell moses you laughed beginning in verse 1 then the lord spoke to moses and to aaron saying when a man has on the skin of his body a swelling or a scab or a bright spot and it an infection of leprosy on the skin of his body he shall be brought to aaron the priest or to one of his sons the priests and the priests shall look at the mark on the skin of the body and if on the skin of the and if the hair i'm sorry in verse 3 the hair in the infection has turned white and the infection appears to be deeper than the skin of his body it's an infection of leprosy when the priest has looked at him he shall pronounce him but if the bright spot is white on the skin of his body and it does not appear to be deeper than the skin and the hair on it has not turned white then the priest shall isolate him who has the infection for seven days the priest shall look at him on the seventh day and if in his eyes the infection has not changed and the infection has not spread on the skin then the priest shall isolate him for seven more days the priest shall look at him again on the seventh day and if the infection has faded and the mark has not spread on the skin then the priest shall pronounce him clean it is only a scab and he shall wash his clothes and be clean but if the scab spreads farther on the skin after he has shown himself to the priest for his cleansing he shall appear again to the priest and the priest shall look and if the scab has spread on the skin then the priest shall pronounce him unclean it is leprosy father would you take us tonight and reveal truths to us from this chapter will help us to see how significant our own sin is the way sin works and how you are its only cure and answer i stand in a room full of redeemed who have come from all kinds of lifestyles but lord even though you have redeemed us to yourself and we aren't what we used to be our battle against sin is daily it's it's hourly and it's even now so we pray in the name of jesus that you would be with us you would give us insight you would give us victory and you would grow", "us as your bride it's in jesus name we pray amen you can be seated well lord willing we're actually going to look at the whole chapter but it is 59 verses and rather than read them all we're going to because a lot of what is in this chapter teaches principles i'm going to try to bring those out after spending time in the whole chapter myself and you're certainly encouraged to read it all as well but first principle that i want to start with is this god sees sin as spiritual sickness god sees sin as spiritual sickness which by the way i've shared this many times does give a new perspective on jesus's ministry because so much of jesus's ministry in the gospels besides teaching and some casting out of demons was healing physical healing we think of that we go man when jesus was here just everybody that was sick he could heal them and it's true there was no sickness aren't you glad nobody ever came to jesus and had jesus say oh i've just never seen anybody get better from that he healed everybody of everything i want to remind you while we can and should we our elders were just meeting to pray over someone right before this service we believe in the physical from god he is jehovah rapha he is the lord who made us and can heal us so we believe in physical healing jesus said one of the signs of believers well they will lay hands on the sick and they will that is one of the signs that will be true throughout the church age that believers will have healings going on so we teach and believe that but there are connected with the physical healings of jesus and i often remind us of that because i think sometimes we miss this and it's worth seeing when jesus heals a man who is blind to be able to see we realize that before we were saved we we couldn't really see spiritual truths we didn't live according to spiritual he heals people that were lame sometimes lame from their mother's womb we see that kind of healing in fact in the book of acts we see that unable to walk well before i was saved i wasn't walking in obedience to the lord and i certainly wasn't walking with the jesus heals a man who's mute he can't talk before i was saved i didn't praise the lord i didn't use my tongue for which god created it i had plenty to say but it wasn't what god created me to do with my mouth", "i was deaf i didn't have ears to hear you see what i'm saying every physical healing has a spiritual analogy to teach us that he's in the business of healing and may i go farther and tell you this that i'm convinced that the physical healings of jesus are to teach us that he can heal us of whatever sin does to us in fact i have a strong conviction that bothers some and i'm not saying that to but to remind you that i don't believe that jesus died on the cross to heal everybody of all their sicknesses why well because it's not working first but that's not really why it's because when the bible says by his stripes we are healed that had nothing to do with read what peter said you were continually straying like sheep but you've returned to the shepherd and the guardian of your souls in his stripes we are healed he's talking about not physical illness that was paid for in the atonement but moral which is far more significant the damage of sin is to remove people from fellowship with god too much of the time as christians we focus on this world and getting physically made well here and we don't we're not we're missing the big picture but i'll get off my soapbox i don't have a soapbox it might do good for my height god sees sin and spiritual sickness isaiah if you're taking down notes some of you a lot of you are isaiah 1 verses 4 through 6. listen to what god says through isaiah about israel sinful nation he's talking about his own people people weighed down with iniquity offspring of evil doers sons who act corruptly they have abandoned the lord they have despised the holy one of israel they have turned away from him where will you be stricken again as you continue in your rebellion the whole head is what sick and the whole heart is faint from the soul of the foot even to the head there is nothing sound in it only bruises and welts and raw wounds not pressed out or bandaged not softened this is the description god has of his own people bruised up damaged by their sin and actually first fill in put in the word flesh leprosy then becomes this picture it manifests itself in our flesh is a type and a picture of what sin is in so many ways we're only going to touch on a handful of them tonight we're going to study them here tonight it manifests itself in the flesh verse", "1 then the lord spoke to moses and to aaron saying when a man has on the skin or on the flesh of his body a swelling or a scab there's some we're going to see there's some diagnosing going on for this illness called leprosy but it's an incredible picture of the way sin works it is connected to the flesh our fallen nature put this down leprosy and sin inward disease that okay that's the nature of leprosy it's an inward disease that begins you cannot even see it and we all know that sin is that's why jesus said out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaks if you want to really know what's in somebody just listen to them their words oh they can fake you out for a while but eventually it'll come out of the the secrets of the heart the evils of the heart spew out of the and and so it is that sin is inside of us it's insidious because it's insidious and it comes sorry it's true it's like that pastor who remember some of you have heard me say this ten times but he had a clock in his church and uh it was the old-fashioned kind of clock around digital clock and it was just not running correctly and so at first they were going to throw it away because it never was the right time it wasn't you know dead it moved but it was never the right time and so instead of getting rid of it and buying a new clock he put a little sign on it that said don't blame the problem lies deeper that's exactly right it's it's not some just you know behavior is something deeper inside of us it's invisible but it manifests itself and put this down in a swelling of the flesh invariably invisibly was the first fill in there and now invariably in verse two when a man has on the skin or if you have king james in the flesh of his body a swelling or it says a rising in the very interesting to me why because the bible tells us that the flesh gets puffed up knowledge puffs up uh it exalts itself that's the nature of the flesh if you feed your fleshly desires they're never instead they just become stronger and bigger and more obvious so leprosy sin same way inward disease invisible but it will manifest itself in some way in the flesh then put this down it's a progressive disease destroys sensitivity and i want you to jot down ephesians chapter 4 verses 17", "through 20. listen to what paul says this i say therefore and affirm together with the lord that you walk no longer as the gentiles also walk in the futility of their mind being darkened in their understanding excluded from the life of god notice this because of the ignorance that is in them because of the hardness of their heart and they having become what's the they become callous having given themselves over to for the practice of every kind of impurity with greediness but you did not this way interesting thing and by the way there's a lot of even still to this day in modern times uh about leprosy like for instance some people maybe some here think leprosy is an ancient disease that no longer really exists in this world and it's not true 2003 i believe was it 2011. 200 000 people in the world still have leprosy in certain places it's still very much but how it's transmitted and how it was believed to be transmitted we're going to talk a little bit about that and how it relates actually to sin but this is an interesting one to me that leprosy actually destroys your ability to have sensation so we often think or hear pictures of or maybe the movies you know a person who's a leper uh having perhaps parts of his body that are these lost digits of his hand or sometimes face um it defaces you and that's true but the reason is not because actually the disease causes you to lose body parts the disease actually prevents you from feeling it destroys literally sensitivity your ability to feel pain and so what happens to people that have this disease is they wind up injuring just you and i don't think about it as much pain is a gift we don't like the gift but the fact is without it you've got a bunch of problems when you get injured your body tells you you're injured you need to do something without the pain you get a splinter in your hand and you just it doesn't you don't feel it it gets infected but you don't deal with it if you don't have the pain you see and so what happens with people's leprosy it affects their a particular nerve in their body depending on where it's manifested and they have no feeling or sensation there it literally is like what sin does sin makes us insensitive to god to his spirit frankly to other people and our consciences can become seared which means we just don't feel it anymore that's one of the dangers of", "practicing sin is you become less and to it even bothering you so it's a progressive disease that destroys sensitivity then it's a disease that separates people from one another and just put in the when people had leprosy and it was diagnosed by the priests or or or by the they were terribly afraid it was infectious and so these people could not first they would be quarantined and then if they had you know they had it they didn't just stay seven days and get to go home they would eventually wind up living the rest of their lives apart from everybody else who was healthy there were some requirements of what they had to do in terms of the way they had to live that's very interesting to me and that's what sin will damage relationships some of us here have no relationship with certain people who have sinned against us and some of us if we're honest may have people in our life who we wish were in our lives but because of our sin they won't have anything to do with us relationships have been damaged and you're hoping and praying even though you've been forgiven the lord's forgiven you you don't even do those kinds of things anymore you're not trying to defend what happened but there's damage there sin pushes us apart it separates us from one another someone has said if you really want to know what sin does the outcome of sin where do we where do we look to see what it does it's christ on the cross it's jesus christ who winds up being condemned abandoned by his own by not just bruised bleeding dying abandoned by everybody including god that's where sin ultimately leads the bible says god made him who knew no sin sin on our behalf in other words we in order that the righteousness of god might be manifested in him so very interesting this is what sin does it separates us from other people put this down it's a hopeless disease incurably the leprous person could not cure themselves this writer says during biblical times there was no natural remedy no exercise program or diets and there were no topical ointments that could touch the depths of this disease this lack of a cure however did not mean that people were not cleansed of the disease miriam only had the disease for a short time on her hand and god healed naaman by having him wash seven times in the jordan and this then leads us to the uh the final uh thing i want to say up", "here and that is this this is a disease that was only healed by the lord in the bible put in the word exclusively very interesting in other words people didn't naturally get better from it just like sin there's no like i don't need the lord i can handle this sin myself that doesn't work that way jot down luke 4 and verse 27 jesus said this concerning lepers in the old testament there were many lepers in israel in the time of elisha the prophet and how many of them were cleansed but only naaman the syrian only one it's very interesting to me you think about it we have a description of what the priests are supposed to do for somebody who has leprosy but actually this is not a how to heal a leper this is how to handle a leper now if they were to get healed there was some direction for them to go on which by the way think about jesus who healed ten lepers do you remember that story it's usually i tell it at thanksgiving ten lepers who stand at a distance from and and no doubt we're saying unclean because that's what this uh the bible tells them they were supposed to do and i have suspicion that they believe jesus would have mercy and compassion on them because he had already done this in the gospel of mark come out and even touch them which is amazing nobody wanted to touch a leper at all ever and jesus touched this man he said i am willing be thou cleansed and he healed this guy and jesus doesn't do that for them do you remember what he did tell them what do you tell them to go listen this is right out of leviticus show yourselves to the priests and offer what moses had commanded there's there's commands for sacrifice when you get healed which is interesting they're not healed yet but he says i want you to go uh to jerusalem and go to the goats do leviticus 13 you could have and as they went they were healed in faith right it's pretty cool because jesus heals lepers on more than one occasion but you don't have anybody else getting better from leprosy by some leprosy cream or leprosy you know acupuncture it doesn't work that way jot down matthew 11 verse 5 when john the baptist doubted that maybe jesus was even the messiah because john has been taken to prison by herod some of john's disciples come to jesus and they say hey are you the are you the", "one or like should we be waiting for somebody else john's just not a hundred you know he was when he said behold the lamb of god but things have kind of changed a little bit and he's in prison and so he's just not just wants a little word from you are you the one or is it you know what jesus did he said basically watch this and he started healing a bunch of people if you go back and read it he just starts healing all kinds of people and then he turns around and says go tell john go tell john what what isaiah said would happen when the messiah comes that's what i'm doing and in particular it said the blind receives sight the lame walk the lepers are cleansed and the deaf let my actions speak the answer to you am i the one i'm fulfilling exactly what prophecy said would happen when the comes it's the lord alone who can heal and i think the point of it is this because sin is in all of us and it's all of these things it does all of these things in our life that this answer that the lord alone can and does praise god not just forgive the damage that sin does and the tendency the habits that we have you know we can stop right now spend the rest of well wouldn't be even close to enough just to hear from each other what has god changed in your what what did you used to be into that you no longer are praise god i know the lord had several people in on my in my path today that i ran across some here uh tonight who i didn't even know their stories and they shared a little bit about their story and you would never know by looking at them that what they used to be and they didn't tell me so i could i'll just have you stand up right now i'm not gonna do that i don't wanna focus on people's past and thank god he doesn't either but you know what you you're in a room full of people who have testimonies as to what we used to be i like to say this you know i am not uh all i should be i'm the first to admit that i know that and i'm definitely not all all i'm gonna but the biggest praise i have is i'm not what i used to be and i'm never going back there ever ever right um so be encouraged if you feel like wow", "i still have this issue of sin in my life jesus didn't die just to get you to limping in the door with all not only the weight and the guilt of your sin but the habits of your sin still binding you and even if you feel like i don't know that i'll ever have victory over this or over that jesus died in order to give you that and you need to believe that first of all if you don't believe that you probably will can i tell you something if you don't start a diet now how would i know about that because i woke up for years every morning saying this is it this is the day the lord has made i'll use that verse too by the way it has no application to tonight or my diet that was the day jesus wrote into jerusalem on a donkey we can say this is the day of the lord's way because it is true but it's just not what that prophecy was about but the fact is i'd wake up every day and say this is the day baby i'm not i'm going for it i'm free i've been haven't eaten in six minutes hours and i can i'm not even hungry i'm good to go some of you go bob don't mock me because you know what that's like or something else i'm not gonna lose my and then somebody walks in the door and or tomorrow i'm not gonna lose my camera i'm today's off the and pretty soon you start to say i i i just never gonna do that i'm never gonna really have victory over that at the moment that you say i'm never gonna have victory over that talk about a self-fulfilling prophecy remember how jesus would say to people be it done unto you according to your so the question i always ask myself and others is well what do you want the lord what are you asking the lord to do nothing well then you might just get what you're asking for be it done unto you according to your faith i don't have any well okay jesus could not do many great works there in nazareth because of the littleness of we need to believe that jesus died for the stuff i'm still not having victory over not just to forgive me but to set you need to believe that it's true you say but i'm not i'm not free yet that doesn't change what he died for listen if somebody put a billion dollars in the bank with your name on it", "but you didn't know how to get it you'd figure it out first of all but i mean if you if you it doesn't mean it's just means you don't have it yet died to set you from sin and to utterly forgive you and to heal you and i do want to encourage you in that because as we study about sin and leprosy we say sometimes like yeah all these things are true it's ruined this relationship and it's my flesh is is you know in i mean anyway all of these things we're studying about are absolutely true there's no big great revelation about that but another in verses 4 through eight sin is a sickness that spreads in the body look at verse four but if the bright spot is white on the skin of the body and it does not appear to be deeper than the skin and the hair on it has not turned white then the priest shall isolate him who has the infection for seven days priest shall look at him the seventh day and if in his eyes the infection has not changed and the infection notice has not spread in the body by the way there's a lot of people who think even modern people who think leprosy is not contagious that was a misunderstanding by the way that's leprosy was absolutely contagious it just wasn't contagious by touch and don't go well i just didn't know anything back then uh can i remind us when covid came out there were people wearing masks in their cars and if you're one of them i i i'm sorry you did that to yourself or if you still do well as the vet you know might just come somebody told me when i i remember when it was first coming out i just gone to the gas station filled up they go oh didn't you hear that's one of the easiest places to get covet is the gas pump but i'm thinking oh okay i got it then and then you know you get the groceries and you're washing them down and you're taking your clothes off because everything is coveted cooties and the fact is we didn't know you know so let's not be too hard on previous generations of what people thought and didn't know because yes they thought being in close proximity touch guess what leprosy is airborne sound familiar it is contagious and so they knew enough needed to be careful they just didn't know really how to handle it but it spreads in the physical body and of course the idea of sin we can see how", "this is true in god's family jot down galatians 5 and verse 9. galatians 5 verse 9 paul says a little leaven leavens the whole lump of dough by the way he also said that to the church at corinth the church of corinth was practicing all kinds of sins they come from a very sinful world there in corinth one of the most wicked cities you think las vegas is bad oh not even close to corinth okay to be a corinthian was a byword people would if you were a corinthian that was just like they would say that about you because if you were a slime bucket you're a corinthian even if you had nothing to do with it it's like you remind me of corinth and uh that's how bad it was but in terms of sexual immorality in terms of immaturity and selfishness and paul they'd gotten saved but there was a lot of those behaviors still going on in the church and so paul knows they're struggling and he's ministering to them but he told this same principle a little eleven leavens a whole lump what's that mean well it's talking about yeast when you put yeast into a lump of dough it permeates the entire lump of dough it it moves through it and the same thing is true with sin leprosy moves through the human body and in the body of christ sin undealt with but influencing other people around it put this down number four be very careful with spiritual interesting here in the bible god requires people to be quarantined wow i should be familiar to most of us and and it's interesting this was god's idea it wasn't the cdc the lord said this is what you're going to do if somebody has these certain things then you're going to quarantine them for seven days and it's during that investigation time we're going to figure out if it's actually leprosy or not so i want to just suggest to you there need in our lives as christians to be very careful about those things that can that can offend us and i think sometimes there's a lot of questions about that we're going to talk about this now and then at the end of the message as well from this chapter you know i think in high school i remember a lot of christians would ask you know do you think it's okay to go to a party suppose it depends on what kind of party it is or you know talking birthday party and pinned the tail on the we're talking", "about some other kind of party oh that kind of party um you know is it okay for a christian to go to a bar if you don't get drunk you know somebody wants to know i remember this guy was asking the pastor if you smoke will you go to hell and the pastor said no but you'll smell like you've been there the bi the bible says make no provision for the flesh with regard to its lusts we are to not just say well where's the line of how close i can get to sin that if i don't go over that i'm i'm still okay uh that whole question of how close can is telling it's telling you something can you imagine i mean you i wouldn't that's a terrible illustration what if your spouse said well how how close can i get to infidelity that's not a question anybody wants to uh that's a terrible illustration just i didn't say that because there's a better one i just don't have it the fact is when we say how close can i get to this practice that i know the practice is saying but can i get around it because my friends are into that and i used to be into that and i won't be the full center i'm just going to go and watch in the same zip code but you know how close can i get to the line and still be saved that is that is the i think i've told you this on a confession but when i was i got saved i was in eighth grade but by ninth grade i'm i'm still saved you wouldn't have known it by the way that i acted uh i mean i went to church so but i was always going to church before that so um but i still talked the same i still reacted the same but i didn't have before were christian who would tell me that the way i was acting wasn't appropriate do you have friends like that now you might say you mean judgmental friends i don't know my my friends i wasn't embarrassed at all by the way not at all until they told me they one of them came up to me because of my language for some of us uh the way that you talk and lose your temper out on the handball and i got a little defensive my first thought was what you what yeah you start using foul words and i said you know what i my dad talks like i was raised in a family", "you know my dad was a sailor so he swears like a sailor and i'm italian that's how we italians i just had every excuse in the world and i remember i even said hey god accepted me the way i am you should accept me the way i am very defensive and then what really got me though was he said well we're just trying to figure out we don't we're not sure we're supposed to eat with such a one as you what is that i didn't know my bible at i'm going to share the passage with you first corinthians 5 verses 9 through 11 where that passage comes from i wrote to you paul says to this carnal church in my letter not to associate with immoral people i didn't mean with the immoral people of the world or with the covetous or the swindlers the idolaters because then you'd have to go out of the world in other words they're all over the place but actually i wrote to you not to associate with any so-called brother if he should be immoral or covetous or an idolater or a reviler or a drunkard or a swindler not even to eat with such a one and uh so they showed me that in the and it was convicting that um they my friends didn't want to hang out with my christian friends and actually god used after i stopped being defensive to start praying about my language and my temper no i can't tell you my language went away completely or my temper went away completely at that point but it was the beginning of god doing a new work in my because god wanted me to change the fact is when it comes to doing things that are sinful like leprosy they're trying to figure out do you have it or not and there's a process to go through to figure out is this the actual is this really sin put this down priests are called to diagnose and treat sin now i say that to you because we think of doctors doing that that's a doctor's to treat sickness but the priests are treating leprosy it's a sickness but the picture i need you to see is this you're a priest please get that in your mind when we talk about the priesthood it's not just a picture of jesus the high priest he is the only high priest but you and i according to peter we are priests and priestesses we share the same role of ministry to people who are spiritually sick put this down a priest according to this chapter discerns", "between what's clean and unclean by in other words most of this chapter is kind of almost like a medical journal a medical in book you can read and it's very very detailed if it's this then it's this if you can do that we'll check this out and do for set very specific this is instructions for the priest to figure out if it's actually leprosy or and i tell you that because you and i have a role to play that maybe we don't want to play 17 times in this chapter by the way it's in verse 6 verse 8 verse 11 verse 15 17 20 22 23 25 27 28 30 34 we have this phrase the priest after the investigation after he figures it out will either pronounce the person clean or he'll pronounce the person unclean the priest's job was to do that and in fact the last verse of the chapter skip all the way down to verse 59 this is the law for the mark of leprosy he's talking here about a garment of wool or linen whether in the warper and the woof or in any article of leather for pronouncing it clean or unclean now we had just studied in a previous chapter two chapters ago food how do you know if it's clean or unclean and god gave all these regulations now it's about leprosy or do they have it or they is it the is it the thing we need to be why do i make a big point of this because you're a priest and just as god gave to the priest the responsibility of knowing whether or not somebody was sick and how to minister to them he's calling you to be part of that ministry to those who are spiritually among his people jot down first corinthians 5 verses 12 and 13 for what paul said have i to do with judging outsiders in other words do you believers not judge those who are within the church don't go no never that's not his point those who are outside god judges hey remove the wicked man from among yourselves there a man was sleeping with his father's wife evidently not his mother was having sex with his stepmom and the church in corinth was kind of like going well we're all under the blood and it's all forgiven you know we love this guy we all kumbaya and paul says ain't going to happen next time you guys gather kick him out why because a little eleven leavens will hold up he's hurting your witness it's gonna influence other and paul says we don't judge", "non-christians in other words what happens a lot of times with christians is this i stop hanging out with those unsaved heathen because they're wicked but then you hang out with believers and you allow them who are in sin and carnal to influence you and you say well i'm just doing this because of the grace of god we're all christians at least we all understand each other and we're forgiving be careful be very careful god is calling us to a holy life and we need to be aware of those people who are believers and how they're affecting us jot down romans 15 14 here's a ministry that is sadly lacking in most churches and in most christians lives in fact even hearing that this is something god intends them to do a lot of christians don't want to ever do it or be part of it but listen to what paul said to the church at rome by the way a place he had never been he knows quite a few of them because you read the end of the book in chapter 16. he's naming them left and right but they're a group of christians he's never met before by and large but here's what he says about a church who he's never met most of them concerning you my brethren i myself am also convinced that you yourselves the whole church are full of filled with all knowledge and able also admonish one another you know what the word admonish means it means to warn it's akin to reprove it means telling somebody something they probably are not going to want to hear because they're doing something now jesus also said in matthew 18 15 if your brother sins go and reprove him private you might win your brother back now so you can show him he's always rub his nose in his sin and make him feel less spiritual than you oh no your goal is is to help him because you he's in trouble galatians it says if anyone is caught in a trespass which by itself is an amazing thing to say because a trespass by definition is but somebody's in sin but they walk right into it with full knowledge you who are spiritual restore such a one in a spirit of gentleness looking to yourself lest you be tempted hey it could have been you there but by the grace of god go i so don't be looking down on people like i could never do that no i can't believe you caught yourself a cr you say you know what i i'm gonna have", "compassion on them because that could have been me or that used to be me or pray it never is but it could still be we are to have a role in ministering truth to one another and truth frankly that isn't going to be easy to minister to so let me ask it this way because i believe this passage if we're priests and we're ministering trying to find out if something is sin or something is leprosy and it's our job to be a part of again a priest discerns between clean and unclean by god's word guess what that's the same way we do by the way when jesus said if your brother's sins go and reprove him in private do you know what the word reprove is in greek it's a word that literally means to show in other words show them from the bible what it is they're doing don't say you know you're in sin well what am i doing i don't know it's just got to be because it bugs me i've never done that before i wouldn't that don't that's not reproving biblically biblically saying here's what and here's what i have seen you do you need to show them from the word of god the word of god has authority should have authority over their lives if they claim to be a christian that's the whole point not just what you think they how they ought to be living but let me ask it this way to you as a christian who speaks truth to you well don't say pastor bo no no no i mean in your who speaks truth to you about the things that you're doing that you should not be now hopefully if you're married you've come to realize that's part of the calling of your spouse some of you are laughing somebody going am i supposed to laugh at that or is it like for real yeah you'll figure that out who speaks truth to you here's what david well let's just read psalm 141 verse 5 and you ask yourself could i pray this and mean it let the righteous smite me in kindness slap me across the face and reprove me it is oil upon my head do not let my david wrote that psalm and by the way he talks about the danger right before that about the influence of his friends i don't want to get sucked into sin because of them you know when david was in the cave hiding from king saul his men said this is your chance kill him saul's in here relieving himself his", "army's out there god's put this is the day the lord has made kill him and he didn't kill him he did cut off a piece of his robe he felt guilty about that why am i touching the lord's anointed tell us god's timing he wants him to be in power it's not for me to be judge and jury i have a big god but his friends wanted him kind of urged him they loved him but they weren't helping him to obey god or trust god at that point and david in psalm 141 seems to be talking about the influences around him and then he said let the righteous on the other hand smite me in kindness i'm i'm going to tell you about one instance in david's life where that happens and it's a fascinating story it's first samuel 25 and uh what had happened is david's men uh he's he's on the run from king saul for years saul has just died but david's been living out in the wilderness with his men and his men have been kind to some of the people that live there protecting them from people that would do them harm their shepherds and uh one of those men who was a landowner wealthy man by the name of and uh so david would like some help uh food really from nabel who's has vineyards and has a lot of wealth and since his men have been so kind and able he sends some of his guys go go to nabel's place and say hey you know we're david's men and we have cared for your shepherds out in the field and we'd be blessed if you know you could help us out his name means i've always wondered what his mom and dad when they were naming him in the what do you think i'd say dave will be a nice ringtone anyway his name means fool and he was a jerk uh everybody knew it um so when these guys from david come and say hey you know can you help us out he says oh who is this day like he acts like he doesn't know who everybody knew who david was he's the one that killed goliath led the nation to victory he knew he was lots of people are rebelling against their masters these days you know he just puts david down and so these guys come back empty hand and say hey david i don't you're barking up the wrong fool over here uh he got nothing for us and here's what he said and dave said what what do you say", "match your horses draw your swords and he he is ticked off that he would be treated that he goes from very humbly asking for some help to uh i'm going to kill him i'm going to kill him and his entire family in self-righteous rage david and 400 he takes an army with him to go kill this guy and wipe him off the planet and the bible says as he's approaching kind of you guys know what patriot naval's wife is the opposite of naval now i've seen this in in real life too sometimes but anyway she is beautiful and she is godly and she is humble her name means joy of the father she's just an amazing woman maybe they got kindergarten or something i don't know not equally yoked at all but what he said and david's coming with 400 and she quickly has a servant put together this like smorgasbord on these two donkeys i mean we're talking tons of grapes and dates and and kills all kinds of animals i mean for his army that's coming and she rushes out like a patriot missile on an incoming nuclear warhead david is coming to kill and she comes and she simply humbles herself do you know what she does she it was my fault which essentially it wasn't she she does it jesus folks it was me i didn't know that those guys had come but it was my fault and and my husband he's true to his name everybody knows she wasn't putting him really she wasn't putting him down she was saving his life you guys don't think she was like i need that jack no that's not what she was doing she was respecting a man who virtually had no right to any and she says something to david let me paraphrase it you don't want to do this when you become king in other words i know what my husband said but i want you to know i know you're going to be on and i want you to know something you will be sorry if you kill my husband and his entire i know god's calling you and he says to her i would have killed them all today he recognizes the lord is reproving him for doing something in his anger that he would regret later folks we need abigail's in our life let me ask you do you have one let me ask you are you willing to be one think about abigail versus bathsheba kind of a difference there now shiva doesn't stand in the way of anything that david did", "when he decided to kill her husband try to get her husband to think that he had got her pregnant nothing zero we don't hear a peep out of her i'm not saying you know she was not afraid of david i don't know but she says nothing abigail puts her own life on the line and is a it's not going to be easy to admonish anybody and it won't always go that way it's been said a true friend is one who stabs you in the front in other words with truth her story winds up being amazing her husband shortly after this gets drunk has a heart attack and dies david says i'll marry her anyway so she winds up being married to the king it's an amazing story sometimes women have come and said i don't know my husband's godless and i let me read you a story not saying your husband's a neighbor or he's gonna die and you're gonna but you are gonna marry the priests were in the healing business paul said to the church of corinth because of the way you're living and treating the lord's supper many among you are sick and some of you have actually fallen asleep they've died because of your sin they had a handbook on how to judge the health of god's people god's standard for what was clean and unclean that is what the bible is and the reason we need it just like they did is because some things look like they were leprosy and they were not look at verse real quickly verse 40 and 41. now if a man loses the hair of his head he is bald but he is clean if his head becomes bald at the front and the sides bald on the forehead but he is clean chuck used to love sharon about that the guy who said it i i'm not bald i just have more face to wash you what do you call a group of rabbits that are hopping backwards receding hairline okay enough on that but we need to know there could be some that looks like a celebrity no no that's you got that one wrong we need the word of god to be able to discern is that a sin or or not god's word gives us clarity about those things and it warns us psalm 19 moreover by them as my servant warned hey stay away from that be you know when the bible says bad company corrupts good morals but we're going to hang out with our non-christian friends anyway because we love them and it's it's okay here's the", "thing we all know who we can safely sin and we might feel like that's so loving they never say anything to me about anything that i'm doing wrong i love being with them yeah we're just accepting just like god is of us really is that how you think it i think jesus said go and sin no more is if i remember right and he came to die for you and he now wants you to depart from sin in your life he doesn't just he accepts you in your sin but he doesn't want to keep you that it's like that commercial i saw years ago for a gay parade and he said they have this big sign you know god loves the gays it's true he does he just doesn't want to leave them that way or leave you in your sin we need to see the heart of god is to help us be forgiven but then also to be changed so we need to see what's in in this god is willing to tell us that is something that needs to go in your life and as believers we're to be telling each other that so to say well i just like to be around people who never say anything about me at all better be careful with that well they're worse off they're such in so much compromise they would never say anything to me that's why i love being you become like the people that you respect and you become like the people you hang out with so it's not that we should never be around non-christians the bible says we can't avoid them and it's not that we should never be around any carnal christians but you've got to be careful in terms of the influence they have on life you imagine if i uh i went to a doctor for a checkup an annual checkup but my doctor he did the tests they took the blood test they did the whole thing and but he didn't really want to share it with me cause there's some stuff in there just good to have you back bob how's it going over at the church still riding the motorcycle good diver you have anything to tell me no you don't want a doctor like that we are to be in the role of the priests who are ministering to people things that need to change because it's going to hurt them put this down a not only discerns between clean and unclean by god's word but a priest directs the proper treatment of the sick", "if you read the rest of this chapter you'll see it's all about almost reads like a medical journal the priest not only does if you will the spiritual lab test to see if it's leprosy it knows how to respond if it is how to prevent it and then if it is there how to heal it disease needs to be treated short of miraculous healing with and with patience not with shame do you remember the good samaritan who finds the jew beaten up on the way from jericho uh and and he's left half dead and uh naked and beaten up and he comes and he pours wine and oil into the wounds binds him up puts him on his own beast takes him to an inn then pays the guy so he could have time to get better and he says if you paint you spend anything more i'll come back you know who the good samaritan is don't you it's jesus that's exactly right he pays the price for us to be healed he ministers to us but there's something about that story see jesus is always healing instantly so we think well that's the way it's got to be otherwise god didn't move oh we don't realize every time you ever get healed of anything that was the lord do you believe that psalm 103 he heals all my diseases listen i used to have horrible sciatica about a year ago it's gone that was jesus you and i need to just stop thinking it's only if it's miraculously and instantaneously and other than that i guess god said no well no that's not true you know the bible says god makes the well i thought it was photosynthesis god using photosynthesis but it's why do we only see god in the supernatural and struggle with seeing him in the natural well it's like well that's that's just i i understand that no you do not otherwise you'd be saying praise god shut down ephesians 4 verses 1 and 2 i therefore the prisoner of the lord did treat you to walk in a manner worthy of the calling with which you've been with all humility gentleness with patience showing forbearance to to one another in love well we're running out of time so let's fill in the blanks a priest declares if a person is clean or unclean if you go through here it's a pronouncement after pronouncement after pronouncement if it's this then it's the priest was given the capacity and the authority to declare the state of jesus would say to people your sins are forgiven really bothered them only god", "can forgive sins and he'd say yes draw the conclusion but he gave that same authority to his disciples shot it down john 20 verse 23 he breathed on them he said receive you the holy ghost and he said this if you forgive the sins of any they've been forgiven if you retain the sins of any they have been retained believers as priests have the authority and the capacity to declare somebody clean or unclean spiritually then number four the sick must accept it and must protect others that's verse 45 and verse 46 they had to wear their garments a certain way their hair a certain way on disheveled uh someone was going to qualify you know they had covered their mouth there was a masked mandate you might say they had to live alone wasn't safe for them to be in fellowship some people who are believers are a danger to others and need to be kept outside the community of the saints did you know that in the book of romans paul says keep your eye on those who cause divisions mark them and have nothing to do with them there are people who are believers or claim to be you're to stay away from the bible's very very clear and finally number five follow god's wisdom with what is questionable uh in the last few verses of the chapter which again i'll commend your own he's talking about garments and he's talking about um seeing whether or not the mark of leprosy is growing in these garments and there was this examination to see if it was spreading jot down first corinthians 6 12 because this is what the principle that i think that we come to uh it's this all things are lawful for me paul said but not all things are profitable all things are lawful but i will not be mastered by anything how can i know when something's questionable there are principles in scripture that tell us there are some things in my life that just need to be that there's no redeeming them at all there are some relationships that are not going to be redeemed there's too much damage in them there are some practices that are not going to get redeemed listen if you're an alcoholic you need to probably accept you're never going to drink responsibly you say wow that's your opinion i'm just telling you there are some things and some of our lives that are going to be gone that's not god's plan to redeem that back in in terms of our life it needs to be taken out", "um it here it talks about things that need to be torn out jesus said if you're i offend you pluck that out if your hand offends you cut up in others get serious about dealing with sin and then there was this process and i'll where he talks about somebody receiving a cleansing for the second time of being defiled with leprosy and i love that it's not even your first rodeo with leprosy but you've gone through this and now you're going through it again and god is the god of the second chance i love that you know what the bible says in john you know jonah go talk to the ninevites tell them 40 days and i destroy and jonah says okay and he goes the opposite direction right and then he you know jonah i mean he's kind of an amazing guy he's out there in this big storm and everybody else is afraid they're gonna die and he finally says you know what you guys it's me it's all about me actually this storm is because i'm not you're not obeying your god these are heathen they don't even believe in yahweh who's your god he's the one who made the sea oh great you ticked off the sea god and uh everybody's praying to their god and they get jonah out of the hole because he's asleep and says you know pray to your god there's no sense in doing that because i know why this is happening he says the only way you're going to make the seed get quiet is if you throw me now frankly i would say let me just do it god you guys move out of the way i'll the only way it's ever going to work out for you guys is if you commit murder so it's how come joe could just jump off nope i'm going to include you somehow in anyway you know the story but after he finally gets rescued by the great fish puked up on the shore the bible says the word of the lord came to jonah a second time and by the way it's the same mission it's like he takes him back to the beginning of the book of jonah like he's never done anything wrong says go to nineveh same message it's like really this is the guy who doesn't obey you doesn't he have to do like teach sunday school for years before i could work what does jesus say to the one who denied him three times i want you to feed my sheep i'm not done with you", "you're not going to be on the sidelines when i forgive you i'll put you right back in the ministry right back into the huddle you're going to be used and that good isn't our god good when he forgives when he cleanses he and has a plan for us let's all stand and sing together so we sing that song sometimes just like lord that's my story i was dead you called my name and i came alive and but you need to see yourself not just as a lazarus but as a leper an ex-leopard do you know when jesus said go show yourselves to the priest for a testimony to them do you know that they would have turned to leviticus 13 and they would have been investigating these guys who had leprosy but now we're healed to declare them clean but that didn't happen in their entire life as priests they didn't need leviticus 13 at all until jesus showed up why because nobody was getting healed of leprosy jesus said nobody got healed but one elijah they just didn't use the passage but when jesus comes suddenly this healing passage is needed and guess what whatever it is that's still a part of your life that's defiling your life hurting other people if you're a believer jesus intends to heal you of that to clean you of that and to make you a new man or a new woman now may the lord bless you may he heal you of your leprosy by the way i talked about reproving others don't walk up to an election i just want your name of leprosy i've just been thinking about you and i've been on my heart it's inside of you it's insidious and uh what was the other one oh yeah it makes you stink and you have bad breath and what were the other ones no this is for us to look into the mirror see ourselves and say yeah lord sin does all those things but the good news is you see people as sick and you have compassion on them you're not sick of them in their sin in their sickness if you will so that you could heal everybody so may the lord give you insight as to how to apply this to yourself and to minister in compassion to those around you because healing is the name of the game that's why he's come god bless you", "website and check them out all right like you to open your Bibles to Deuteronomy the 2 law is what the word Deuteronomy means Deuteronomy chapter 4 and in chapter 4 as I've said uh we are still reviewing Moses is reviewing the Salvation history of Israel from the time they came uh over the 40 years as they come out of Egypt and he's telling the new generation that is being called to go into the promised land uh some things that they need to know remember this whole book takes about a month uh in in the uh as opposed to the Book of Numbers which covers 40 years or almost there 38 to 40 years and so it's very different but it's the last words of Moses before Moses will die and the children of Israel will go into the promised land under Joshua so Deuteronomy 4 we pick our text up in 21 Moses talking and he says now the Lord was angry with me on your account and he swore that I would not cross the Jordan and that I would not enter the good land which the Lord your God is giving you as an inheritance for I will die in this land I shall not cross the Jordan but you shall cross the Jordan and take possession of this good land so watch yourselves that you do not forget the Covenant of the Lord your God which he made with you and make for yourselves a Graven image in the form of anything against which the Lord your God has commanded you for the Lord your God is a consuming fire he's a jealous God when you become the father of children and children's children and have remained long in the land and act act corruptly and make an idol in the form of anything and do that which is evil in the sight of the Lord your God uh in the sight of the Lord your God so as to provoke him to anger I call Heaven and Earth to witness against you today that you will surely perish quickly from the land where you are going over the Jordan to possess it you shall not live long on it you'll be utterly destroyed the Lord will scatter you among the peoples and you'll be left few and number among the Nations where the Lord drives you and there you'll serve Gods the work of man's hands wood Stone which neither see nor hear nor eat nor smell verse 29 but from there you will seek the Lord your God and you will find him", "if you search for him with all your heart and all your soul when you're in distress and all these things have come upon you in the latter days you will return to the the Lord your God and listen to his voice let's pray father I pray for those that might be sad tonight and discouraged those maybe even that are here that are angry and Lord I know that you have the capacity to not just know who that is but to touch us to minister to us to come alongside of us Lord a lot of the times it's just disappointment things didn't go the way we had hoped sometimes it's disappointment in our own attitudes or reaction to other things so Lord would you just come and Minister according to our need it's not everybody thank you that it's not always everybody but right now tonight you know the word that each one of us has uh from you that you want us to receive so give us ears to hear what you're saying to us individually and to us as a church in Jesus name amen you can be seated now last time we we were together we covered the verses prior to this but I do want to look back at verses 9-2 very briefly so if you look back in four Moses said this only give heed to yourself keep your soul diligently so that you do not forget the things which your eyes have seen and they do not depart from your heart all the days of your life but make them known to your sons and to your grandsons remember the day you stood before the Lord your God at Horeb when the Lord said to me assemble the people to me that I may let them hear my words so they may learn to fear me all the days they live on the earth and that they may teach their children your children verse 11 you came near you stood at the foot of the mountain the mountain burned with a fire to the very heart of the heavens Darkness cloud and thick gloom and then the Lord spoke to you from the midst of the fire you heard the sound of words but you saw no form only a voice put this down at the top of the outline if you would salvation involves a personal God it wasn't just that God delivered the law to Moses and Moses gave it to the people or just that they heard God say these are the rules whereby you should live there's something far more", "personal going on and Moses is calling this generation to remember what God has done in their lives personally I think it's really important that we point this out because there are sometimes people are considering Christianity and they're deciding if they want to believe in it based on well is this really happen is the evidence there and I'm glad for that I'm glad that you would be Skeptics would look at the evidence but Christianity isn't just something that is a belief system that you say I think it's probably true so I'm going to be be a Christian it doesn't work that way it involves a personal encounter with the Living God and my question for everybody here because you're the ones I get to talk to and if anybody's watching online is this have you had that or do you believe because somebody else believes or because somebody told you or you were raised this way or you're kind of convinced it must have be Jesus must have come back from from the dead because look at of all the effects it had I'm I'm curious tonight salvation involves a person encounter with God couple of verses 1 John 1 and verse one listen how John begins his first epistle he says what was from the beginning what we have heard what we have seen with our eyes what we beheld and our hands handled concerning the Word of Life Peter in his epistle says this we did not follow cleverly devised when we made known to you the power and the coming of the Lord Jesus Christ but eyewitnesses we saw him in his glory on the mount he's talking about one of those Peter James and John moments up on the Mount of transfiguration it it's not somebody else's story that I want you to believe CU I heard somebody else say it it's something I experienced my S faith is more than accepting certain events in history are true if involves having a lifechanging experience yourself it's so important that you get that because if you want to be effective at ministering to somebody else it can't just be I believe it's true so you should it has to be I know it's true because I've had experience myself the Bible doesn't say study and determine that the Lord is good it says taste and see that the Lord is good experience it yourself it's interesting Moses says you saw the fire burning to the midst of the heavens and you heard the voice do you remember what the two guys on the road to EMAs said after Jesus", "disappeared and they realized it was Jesus did not our hearts burn within us when he spoke the word to us it was a very real experience that changed the rest of their lives and God says I did that so that you might learn to fear God all the days of your life and that you might teach your children about not just what to believe it's more than teaching them what they should believe it's about sharing your testimony of what you've experienced you can't share a testimony you don't have but it's interesting to me God says it's that you would fear God remember to fear God means to love him so much you wouldn't want to offend him you're not afraid of him it's the fear of God that's reverence the Bible calls it the the beginning of WI wisdom the beginning of having the right way to live this life is to live it in the fear of God you know Ecclesiastes written by Solomon the wisest man who ever lived who made some big mistakes in his life but at the end of that book he's talking to a new generation how do I know that because he says these words in the beginning of chapter 12 remember your creator in the days of your youth well if you're saying that to an old man a little late so he's talking to somebody say hey while you're still young remember remember your creator Ecclesiastes 12: 13 and 14 though these are the last two verses of the book this is the bottom line of the whole book of wisdom he says this here's the conclusion when all has been heard here it is fear God fear God and keep his Commandments because this applies to every person for God will bring Every Act to judgment everything which is hidden whether it is good or evil you can't can't escape this the fear of God is something you should want if you don't know what it is you probably don't it but when you have a fear of God you'll say this is the way God intends me to live and it's the word from the Lord the encounter with God himself that'll cause you to have that experience to not only share with others but to live out the rest of your life well now let's get into our text tonight see the limits of the law and its inabilities fill in the blanks limits and inabilities on your outline if you're taking it if you didn't get a sheet there by the door there verse", "21 and verse 22 Moses says the Lord was angry with me on your account why was that do you remember yeah it's not he's not he's not uh doing an Adam you know remember when God said to Adam have you eaten of the tree that I forbidden you how did you know you were naked his answer was the woman oh yeah that thou gavest me did give it to me I I want to must my idea he played the blame game right the first effect of sin is shame they were naked and the second is blame it's always still that way you're going to blame somebody else for what you did and you're going to want to try to cover it up but uh this is not what Moses is doing it reads that way sometimes to people they think he's blaming the people no he's not he's simply saying the Lord was angry with me with regard to that time when I dealt with you the way that I did when I got when I lost my temper God said to speak to the Rock and I decided I'd smack it a couple times remember on your account and God swore that I would not cross the Jordan he's been leading him for 40 years he is their physical savior that got him out of Egypt in order to go to the promised land but he's not going to get to go in and he said and God swore that I would not enter the good land which the Lord your God is giving you as an inheritance now it's good to see that Moses is not only the one who brings the law of God he represents the Law all through the scriptures put this down God's law is perfect that's Psalm 19 by the way the law of the Lord is perfect God's law is perfect but it perfect spelled the same way two perfects God's law is perfect but it cannot perfect you is the idea so Moses a type of the law Joshua is a type of Christ Joshua's name Yeshua means the Lord saves Yahweh saves that is Jesus's actual name we call him Jesus but his name is Yeshua his name is Joshua um John 1 and verse 17 John's talking of a contrast between Jesus and Moses the law was given through Moses on the other hand great face and Truth notice are realized or experienced through Jesus Christ remember when Jesus uh was glorified on the Mount of transfiguration we know that the Bible says that Moses and Elijah appeared with", "him and we've talked about this how yes Moses didn't get to go into the promised land but wasn't the end of the story he'll get there clearly in the gospels he made it but it's not just that that I want you to see it's interesting that there are two significant people from the Old Testament appearing in glory talking with Jesus what were they talking to him about his departure the word in Greek is the word Exodus literally the departure he's talking they're talking about the cross they're talking about the way he's going to leave this earth which is going to happen shortly after that in Jerusalem and so Moses and Elijah are having this discussion about Christ's death on the cross and it's interesting that there's two of them remember in the Old Testament every fact has to be established by at least two witnesses and it's not just any two witnesses because Moses really represents the Law Elijah represents the prophets and you'll find this phrase throughout your Bible the law and the prophets that's a reference to what you call Genesis to Malachi the entire Old Testament testify bear witness to who Jesus is when Paul would go into the synagogues he would show everyone that Jesus from Nazareth is the Messiah they've been waiting for and he would prove it by the law and the prophets that is everything in the Old Testament so we have Moses representing the law and Elijah the prophets it's interesting in the Book of Revelation 11 there are two witnesses I believe they're going to be Moses and Elijah who will again in the promised land be there and bear witness to who Jesus Jesus is so law is represented in Moses and God's law we know reveals our transgressions it doesn't tell us how to get to heaven it tells us why we can't get to heaven unless something changes because we are sinners and we fail God's requirements so God's law wasn't given to make us holy God's law I've said it before was to come to make us speechless every mouth will be close the Bible says on the day of judgment because the law will make it clear we're Sinners we won't there won't be any I object you know there won't be anything like that baith bind the guy and take them out it won't be happening but God's law reveals our transgression and it condemns men for their sin Romans 3:20 is the verse by The Works of the law no flesh will ever be justified in God's sight for through the law comes the knowledge of sin so as", "James says the law the Bible but the law particularly is a mirror we see our s we see our reflection and we see the Lord and we realize I don't measure up so the priests would come and they would bathe before they would go into the sanctuary um it's interesting in the Book of Revelation John sees a a sea of glass and people have thought oh this some kind of an ocean no no it's the sea it's the sea is referring to the labor that's the Old Testament word in the King James it's it's it's of glass because you see in the Old Testament the women of Israel used their mirrors they donated their mirrors and they made the laor the sea which the priests would wash their hands in before they would go into the sanctuary but the fact is the mirror itself you see if you stand in front of a mirror and you go oh my goodness I got a big dirt thing on my face here the mirror shows you the dirt but it doesn't help you with the dirt you're not going to take the mirror off doesn't work that way you need something more and so the law reveals to you your failings but it cannot wash you and that's of course why Jesus Christ has to shed his blood he is the Lamb that takes away the sin of the world doesn't just show it to you rub your nose in it put this down unbelief robs everyone of the great blessings of God behind this multitude that's getting ready to go into the promised land I've said is the Wilderness that's the burial ground for all those who died because of their unbelief Hebrews 3 and verse 19 if you're taking notes jot that one down 3:19 they in the book of Hebrews there's much to be said about the children of Israel and why they didn't get to go into the promised land it says and so we see that they were not able to enter the promised land because of un belief Faith which is revealed in trust is the master key you might say that unlocks all the promises of God from the moment of Salvation the first experience with the promise of God to save you which comes about by faith not works and every other promise that you'll ever experience in this life and in the next it comes about by faith which is expressed through trust in God and obedience to his word but that's the master key that unlocks them unbelief you might say is the deadbolt that", "keeps those promises shut up from us that's true for me that's true for you it's true for the masses and it was definitely true for Moses that's what saying how do I know that numbers 20 and 12 but the Lord said to Moses and Aaron because you have not what believed me you have not believed me to treat me as holy in the sight of the sons of is Israel therefore you shall not bring the assembly into the land which I have given them unbelief is what keeps us from receiving the best blessings of God put this down number three it's time to cross over and possess what God has promised Moses says I can't take you in well that's because of unbelief even Moses a man who talked to God face to face I don't care how spiritual you've been in the past that doesn't mean you're being spiritual right now now every one of us needs to live by faith and if we don't we're going to miss out on all that God has for us to the degree that we don't live by faith there are consequences but here's the point he's saying I can't go in but you as a generation are going in you're trusting God for it that's for you there is a line the Jordan River and in a sense every saint must cross a line if you will to possess God's promises many of you have heard of George Mueller of Bristol if you haven't I encourage you to look him up and read about him he was a man that was greatly used of God to minister to orphans in England and to minister to a lot of hurting people through the gospel but he was a man of great faith and he was well known in his day um to somebody who asked him the secret of his service George Mueller answered with these words The Secret of my service there was a day when I died utterly died as he spoke he he bent lower and lower until he almost touched the floor I died he said to George Mueller his opinions his preferences his tastes his will I died to the world it's approval or its censure I died to the approval or blame even of my brethren and my friends and since that day I have studied only to show myself approved of God I believe there is a line of consecration that every believer has the whole congregation was saved but they didn't go into the promised land they died in the place of unbelief", "there's too many Christians who never go line by faith and experience all that God has you know I think sometimes we get this idea if we really had faith in God we'd see more miracles I hear that sometimes with Christians I find that an perspective now God can do miracles andever wants and I think he wants to do more than most of us ever get to see but let me just say something about this are you aware that more miracles were being performed during the 40 years the children of Israel came from Egypt in fact they started while they were still there to the promised land than ever before in human history every single day God's presence was visible seems to me God says we're supposed to walk by faith not by sight H interesting because God's should kind of Glory was visible pillar of cloud by day Pillar of Fire by Night bread I'm talking about the official Wonder Bread of all time was being provided every day miraculously they didn't have to go to work they didn't have to raise C they couldn't raise crops they didn't have to kill their cattle it was just bread from Heaven pretty cool their clothes never wore out that cool you don't have to you don't Amazon don't have to give people something for their birthday or Christmas it's coming you you just look great in that for 40 Years it'll fit you one size fits forever I guess I don't know but the fact is God was doing Miracles not to mention healing the water providing water out of the rock the quail God is doing Miracles and more than ever in history and and yet this is the generation that doesn't have enough Faith to go into the pro if you think you need more miracles to believe God you're wrong you don't that's why Jesus said to the people that were demanding a miracle from him remember Herod was very excited about seeing Jesus at first I'm sure he wasn't thrilled when pilate said you know what uh you're from where okay we'll send you over to the other zip code you're in herod's jurisdiction goodbye get out of here and uh Herod was like delighted good I I've been wanting to see Jesus I want to see a miracle can you do a little show for me and Jesus had nothing even to say much less do for him he was disappointed but remember when the Jews demanded that Jesus do some miracles to prove you are who you are do a sign and Jesus said an evil and", "adulterous generation seeketh after a sign no sign will be given to it except of Jonah as Jonah was in the belly of that fish three days and three nights so shall the son of men be in the heart of the earth talking about the resurrection that's it that's the only sign you need and that's the only sign you're going to get fascinating to me but we We crave sometimes Miracles I I'm not really I want to know God's Alive still he's still working works on my and I know as as a young Christian I wanted to see something that would prove it to me you know how many miracles John the zero and you know what Jesus said of him he was the greatest of men born of women now I've always been kind of Blown Away by that description because I'm thinking to myself I think that's you Jesus actually as you describe but he said the greatest of men born of women obviously Jesus was born of God but was John the Baptist never did a miracle now I'm not saying you're better if you do Miracles Jesus did Miracles but my point is if you think you need to have a word of knowledge you have to speak in tongues you need to feel the power of God I'm not saying there's anything wrong with it what I saying is be careful church at Corinth Paul said you have every spiritual gift they're all happening and you are carnal so I'm not saying if you're doing Miracles and you're seeing God work that's carnality I'm saying you don't need it to be spiritual God does Miracles many times to initiate Faith but they're not designed to to sustain faith God drove my car with no gas I was there I saw it happen you didn't you don't have to believe it I know it happened does that mean I never lose my temper I never worry I never do no that does that was a great day but that was then this is now he still drives my car with no gas I have a Tesla but anyway just happens to be the way it is right put this down beware of drifting compromise in verse 23 and verse 24 so watch yourselves you might even underline that so watch yourselves that you don't forget the Covenant of the Lord your God which he you and if you do that if you forget you're going to make yourselves a Graven image in the form of well anything against which the Lord your God has commanded you watch yourself that you", "don't do that verse 24 for the Lord your God is a consuming fire a jealous God put this down don't forget God's command to watch look back at verse 9 real quick only give heed to yourself he says in verse 9 look at verse when you become the father of children and children's children and remain long in the land and act corruptly and make an idol in the form of anything and do that which is evil in the sight of the Lord your God so as to provoke him to anger this is the concern that he has this all has to do with idolatry you know um some of you have memories like I do if you grew up in Southern California or anywhere near the beach as a as a young child um I was the youngest of five and and every it seems like in the summer my mom would put all the kids in the car we'd go down to the beach for the day down to Newport or Belo or one of the beaches hunington and I can still remember some of the great memories of my childhood is going down to the beach even as was a little boy probably six or seven years old and uh my mom would put her beach chair you know on the beach she didn't really go in the water much but uh she'd be right there by the Lifeguard stand and we put all our towels out and then we just go out in the water and just enjoy it we'd rent rafts and just kind of cruise around on the rafts out there beyond the break and it was just great and uh I'll never forget one time I had gone out past the break and I was just laying down I might have just I don't think I fell asleep but I was just relaxing seemed I don't know for a while and then I decided Well I'm getting hungry so it's time to go in and I started to to uh you know paddle in and as I'm paddling in I'm looking right next to the LIF guard thing where Mom was and my mom was gone her her her chair was gone and so we're all the towels of my my brother and my three sisters gone and I thought and I couldn't I didn't see my mom I didn't see my brother and sisters out in the water I think they left me they left me I was terrified I didn't you know I I couldn't believe it and so I'm paddling", "and pan well I I got to the shore went up to where Mom was supposed to be mom wasn't there and then I realized I was looking at the wrong lifeguard stand while I had been over the breakers my little raft had drifted and I had gotten completely disoriented in not that long of a time and she was right where she was supposed to be it was me that wasn't in the right place why do I share all that besides it's a fun memory Hebrews 2 and verse one is why listen to what the writer says Hebrews 2 and verse one for this reason we must pay much closer attention to what we have heard lest we well drift away from it our danger is that we forget God's C Covenant his word we forget his promises to us we stop living in light of the mission that we know we're on we start getting caught up with the things of this world I think of what Paul said to the Elders of Ephesus in Acts 20 after being there three and a half years planting that great church that he said I'll never see you again this is our last meeting and it was a heavy time and he was sharing about his ministry and then he said this I know after my departure Savage wolves will come in among you not sparing the flock And Men from your own midst will rise up speaking perverse things take heed to yourselves you better keep an eye on yourself you see just because you're walking with the Lord and a lot of you I know are and just because you're involved in the ministry and those Elders were just because you're a spiritual leader does not mean that you can't drift away from the work of the Lord in fact it's possible to be so focused on the work of the Lord you neglect the lord of the work let me put it this way Ministry is no substitute for intimacy don't misunderstand those two yeah intimacy is a basis for Ministry not the other way around and it's easy to think I'm close to the Lord because I'm being used because I'm I'm reading the word because I'm ministering to other people that's it's great but what you put this down see the consequences away from the Lord Hebrews 3 and: 12 take care Brethren lest there should be in any one of you an evil unbelieving heart in Falling Away From the Living idolatry comes in the form of well anything that's what it says in our text", "did you see it in verse 23 watch yourselves that you don't forget the Covenant of the Lord your God he made with you and make for yourselves a Graven image in the form of well anything it's twice that it says it uh anything in verse 25 the form of anything um I go in yearly to have uh to physical um I have blood drawn uh twice a year because of certain medications I'm on to check see how my liver's doing good see I can't see inside of myself I know how I feel and I know eggs and pains but I can't see everything inside of myself so I need someone else to help me with that just because I feel okay does not necessarily mean I am okay now that's what Paul the Apostle said about himself spiritually 1 Corinthians 4 and verse 4 Listen how he put it I'm not conscious of anything against myself yet I am not by this fact acquitted but the one who examines me is the Lord in fact the church at leoa there in the Book of Revelation Jesus writes him a letter and he says well from your own perspective you're doing pretty good you say you're rich and have become wealthy and well need of nothing but you do not even know what I know and that is you're actually spiritually wretched miserable poor blind and naked in other words many times we're a poor we do poorly to judge how we're really doing even in the spiritual realm you say well Pastor I feel like I'm fine spiritually well that's fine I'm glad for that but we need to remember that the heart of man is desperately wicked and deceitful above all else who can know it the Bible says and don't say I do no you're wrong you don't that's why we're to not go in for a just a physical we're to go to the great physician for a spiritual we need a spiritual exam remember remember what Paul says to the Church of Corinth examine yourself to see if you be in the faith or do you not recognize this about yourself that Christ is in you what's the prayer that David has us pray in Psalm 139 search me oh God know my heart try me see if there be any wicked way in me I I I don't know of anything but that doesn't mean there's not a problem here I need I need your help so keeping an eye on yourself means Lord I'm I'm doing checkups with with you and I think we should have daily accountability with", "God I I hope you're praying daily and I hope in part you're asking forgiveness of sins oh I don't need to do that every day do I well I don't know Jesus said in your daily prayer how do I know it's daily because we're asking for Daily Bread to forgive us our sins by the way don't ask forgiveness for sins without dealing with the people who have hurt you because Jesus put a little asterisk on that part of the prayer that's the only part of the prayer he actually comments on after he gives the prayer he says uh that if you don't forgive he says in the prayer forgive us as we forgive those who trespass against us so you're supposed to say Lord I need your forgiveness but I only want it to the degree I only have a right to it to the degree I'm willing to forgive others and then Jesus later comments and says because if you don't forgive from the heart your heavenly father won't forgive you now does that mean you're going to hell no it means you're breaking fellowship with God you don't lose your salvation because you sin you lose the enjoy of the presence and the power and the the joy of the Lord so when you pray God forgive me daily deal with the people that you need to forgive that's usually it's easier for me to ask God to you know why it's not hard for me to ask God to forgive me because I'm not telling him something know see sometimes it's hard for us to ask somebody to forgive us because that means I'm admitting something that I may not want you to know I'm kind of hoping you don't think I really did anything kind of hoping maybe I don't have to tell you something I did that you didn't notice cuz I don't want to be the one telling you have you ever told somebody you're sorry and they didn't know you something Maybe not maybe it's never happened to you it happens to me all the time people come up to me oh Pastor I'm so sorry I fell asleep during service I've been working graveyards or I've been you know just working night and I I'm so sorry and uh I'll say I didn't notice oh you didn't oh never mind I just too late but I'll be watching you next no I don't say that but God already knows so it's no problem not only does he already know He already forgave it it's really easy now sometimes we struggle with even asking", "God to forgive us why I don't know just Pride just stupid I'm sorry that's me I why we really think he's going to say I forgive everybody else and I forgave you every other time but not this one I've had no of course he will forgive you if you will ask and mean it so ask it's the other part for when I ask the Lord to forgive me and I realize oh wow I also have to deal with those people that I'm a little ticked off at who aren't asking me okay that's the harder one for me to deal with well anyway God checks our heart when we ask him to forgive us put this down realize God is unwilling to affections in verse 24 the Lord your God is a cons consuming now God describes himself and in the book of Hebrews it calls him that as well a a a fire consuming fire now I know that when the Bible says that God is jealous some people are stumbled by that um here here's here's where that stumbling comes in hopefully it doesn't bother you but it might or maybe you're going to meet somebody who it bothers um the Bible says that God is love that's first John 48 we know that God is love by way love is not God don't mix that up those AR the same God is good but good is not God some people spell god with two o's you know that thank goodness I don't know who that is but anyway God is love and then in 1 Corinthians 13 we're told love is not so when we read here God is jealous it's like well I don't really understand this how is God Jealous by the way if you're not aware of this this is according to her own words what stumbled Oprah Winfrey in her relationship with God is hearing a preacher say that God is jealous there's a whole story that she shared on air about how when she heard this great preacher that all these people would go here say those words she said God is jealous of me it did May it did she lost lost her faith at that point in God here's the thing the Bible says we're to put off all anger and wrath but the Bible also says God is a anger that's not when God like oh he loses his temper every once in a while sometimes people feel bad like Jesus went into the temple is like and he took the whip it's like oh man I pray for you", "Jesus don't bother that was absolutely nons sinful anger it's holy indignation of God it's different than the anger that most of us ever have although it is possible by the way to be angry and not sin how do I know because God commands it be angry but sin not the Bible says most of us have the first half of that command down really good we're angry but the not sinning part is really tough but God when he is angry he never sins so it's different than anger holy jealousy maybe that seems odd To You Paul the Apostle says to the Corinthians this is the metaphor he uses he says I betrothed you I got you engaged to Christ but I'm jealous with a Godly jealousy over you because you might be led astray from the Simplicity of Devotion to Christ and you're going to get caught up with stuff other than Godly jealousy that's of course what the Lord has we need to remember God told his people in Exodus 20 you shall have no other Gods before me and then a few verses later he says you shall have no other gods besides me in other words it's just not enough that I'm the number one God I need to be the only God just picture yourself getting married and having the person say well you'll be my one of the four or five that I still like to hang out with it's like that's a problem if it's not only and all it's not any at all it's not going to work and that's the way it is with the Lord now that God is a consuming fire it shouldn't freak you out it should actually bless you up why cuz well anything that fire touches soon becomes fire too aren't there times when you feel like I'm kind of sick of myself so tired of me we can pray God consume me Set Me Free from my fleshly inclinations make me burn bright and pure holy and hot for you touch me with your Holy Fire Lord cuz what fire touches becomes fire put this down L see see how their story that is Israel's story tells his story in verses 25-31 God is warning them about the consequences of course of falling away and uh worshiping idols and I'll be honest with you when you first think about it it's kind of like well is that really going to be a problem for them well we know it's going to be a problem but they didn't know that the fact is it seems like an odd", "command at this point here you have the children of Israel who are actually of Faith going into the promised land they haven't been worshiping Idols lately um we know that the whole story starts out with them leaving Egypt their parents and when Moses didn't come down from his 40-day quiet time and they weren't sure if he was alive that they start worshiping the golden calf right that Aaron Bill thanks Aaron assistant pastor and uh we know that the Egyptians worshiped Cavs I was like but we're going to call lord it's Yahweh but it's a Graven image I mean they were violating God's commands before they ever were delivered but they knew it was wrong so it's a little bit odd right here that God is going to say something about idolatry because they're really in a good place right now spiritually and yet God is giving them warnings in the text about about idolatry verse 25 when you become the father of children and children's children and have remained long in the land so this is not where they are now this is on the other side of the Jordan when you're in the promised land and by the way it's kind of future still CU it's those of you that aren't even married yet or those of you that have gotten married but no kids yet after you have your babies Oh No after they grow up and have babies when your parents and your grandparents and you've been living in the land that God gave you and that you didn't build the houses you didn't plant The Vineyard you're just enjoying all the blessings of God which kids are by the way the fruit of the womb is a reward blessed is the man who sees his children's children Psalm 128 in other words when you're just enjoying the blessings that God has poured on your life he says this when all that is going on and you corruptly and you make an idol in the form well of anything and you do that which is evil in the sight of the Lord your God so as to provoke him to anger I'm going to tell you what's going to happen now I find it fascinating Moses I don't know that Moses knows it sounds like he's talking about a hypothetical situation cuz why would you be telling these people who don't even worship idols here's what's going to happen cuz it's what's going to happen Moses in Deuteronomy 4 is given by the Holy Spirit a preview of exactly what's going to happen to the nation of Israel I", "don't just mean this generation for the next 40 years I'm talking about Israel's entire existence I don't know if you caught it or noticed it as we read it but I don't want you to miss this put this down prophecy is the mold into which God has poured history and that's what we have before us in the rest of our text tonight prophecy is history written in advance and he says after you are blessed and you're enjoying the blessings of God and your parents and grandparents you've lived long in the promises you know um I know this to be true maybe you do too Prosperity is often the greater test of character than adversity let me say that again Prosperity is often a harder test for people and their faith than adversity Psalm 119 verse6 119:67 I don't think we have that one but it says this before I was afflicted I went astray but now I keep thy word you say well Bob I don't I don't mind if God tests me with prosperity let me win the lottery Lord I I'll do fine you know D David was Victorious over the Philistines again and again and again on battlefield he was never defeated on the defeated by looking at yeah and by the way if you read the context he's living in a time of Peace the war of kind of behind him he's Victory he sends his troops out he do even need to go at the time when kings go out to battle not David don't need to I have people that handle that handle it joab things are going good those are blessings idolatry if we replace god anything we will wind up serving which is the same Hebrew word for worshiping the same gods that the worship even though God has blessed you God says in that time of blessing be careful because if you act corruptly you'll wind up actually serving those same gods of the people that God has ousted out of the land you know somebody has said uh our our dollar bills our 50 Bill all of our currency says in God we trust but it probably ought to say in this God We now I pray that's not true for you but Jesus said you cannot serve God in M you cannot serve God in money you can't have masters you say well I don't have any other I don't have Idols Bob are you sure it could be your spouse it could be your your house if that's what you're all about your hubby or your hobby your Pursuits or your pleasures", "the the big question is not what's in your wallet it's what do you really worship and if you're not sure it's not that hard to find out just give me your calendar give me your checkbook I'll you where do you spend your time where do you spend your money that will tell us where your heart really is interesting story I have a slide that goes with it if we could put the uh slide up there the other one you don't have the other one well then imagine a toilet this writer said this they had it earlier but this illustration is going down the tubes but this article have you noticed how important our phones have become to all of us we tend to joke that we feel naked if we don't have them on our person at all time some of us have become so dependent on them that we're willing to go to Great Lengths and fall sometimes to not be separated from them such was the case when a woman recently dropped her phone in an ouse latrine at the Olympic National Forest in state first she tried reaching in for it then she tried using her dog's leash I don't understand this to fish it out when that failed she dismantled the seat tried using the leash as a lifeline and leaned in holding onto the leash leaned into the hole to dig deeper and that's when it happened the entire rigging gave way she plunged head first into the Cesspool of waste below thankfully somehow she found her phone in all that muck and managed to call 911 for help but it took two different fire departments considerable time to retrieve her the fire department's Medics cautioned her of the health risks of her exposure and contamination she declined treatment opting to just go home in humiliation and then the writer who's a Believer says it seems that which we love we pursue but often to our Peril phones technology money even other people we must stop and ask ourself is it worth it will pursuit of this priority bring me health and happiness or danger and destruction I said life is a balancing act Lo can be good things helpful things diving into sewage to save one not so much for where your treasure is well there will your face be um I think it's easier to see other people's Idols than our own because if you don't identify something as an idol praise God I hope you don't have one but it's easy to become your own Idol Bible says in the last days difficult ult times will come", "for men will be lovers of self and that's nothing new but it is what our culture is all about and people will applaud you for it take care of number one which is you well put this down while we fail miserably God is faithful entirely in verse uh 26 he talks about what's going to happen if they fall into idolatry he said I call Heaven and Earth to witness against you today that you will surely perish quickly from the land where you were going over to the Jordan to possess it you shall not live long on it you'll be utterly destroyed in other words as a nation and the Lord will scatter you among the peoples and you'll be left few in number according to the Nations where the Lord drives you now they don't have what you have you have the whole Old Testament that tells you what happened children of Israel did go in they did settle the land and you know and some years to go after they had enjoyed the land the tribes would separate into the northern and the kingdoms after Solomon's death and rabo and jeroboam in the north and for political reasons he would set up places to worship Yahweh really in the form of bail worship CF worship up in the north and that idolatry would be reintroduced it would be accepted Believe It or Not by the people and after God had warned the northern kingdom repeatedly to repent and they refused God would use the Assyrian Empire to come down and invade the land and uh destroy the the 10 Northern tribes as as a nation of Israel would cease to exist I'm sure the southern with Jerusalem and the temple felt much more spiritual to say hey we're not like them we worship in Jerusalem they should have they've and yet God is calling Jeremiah and Isaiah and the prophets to tell the southern Kingdom don't think you're so spiritual because you're just as guilty and the southern Kingdom Falls as well into Idol idolatry hard to believe but they do and in 586 the Babylonians come in and they take the nation of Judah the southern Kingdom of Judah and Benjamin into captivity for 70 years to allow the land to be recovering because they weren't obeying God's commands to let it grow fow as they were supposed to give it the Sabbath rest and we know what happens that God takes these people that want idolatry like the Nations and he puts them in the most idolatrous nation that has ever existed the mother of all harlotry in Revelation where the Tower", "of Babel originated it's like you want Idols you want to worship these here you go it's like go for it you know and uh but the nations are literally destroyed as God displaces them and finally after 70 years God brings them back in his grace they rebuild the Temple and they're there but when Jesus comes they Messiah if you had known in this day the things that make for peace Jesus said but now they're hidden from your eyes and Jesus prophesies what will happen 40 years later as Titus the Roman will come and obliterate the city of Jerusalem he will destroy the temple a million Jews will die in Jerusalem and if you think that would break their Spirit you're wrong just a few years later in the early 130s the baroka Revolt will happen and hadrien the emperor will say enough and he will send the troops down and this time it's not just Jerusalem they wipe out what's left of the Jewish nation and they expel all Jews out of the land of Israel and they are scattered you've heard the word diaspora that means the scattering of seed they the Jews are scattered just like God said all over the world now you can show the slide that you do have that one there with the blue in the dark well it's on the back screen look over there there it is either one that's where the Jews were dispersed all over the world exactly what God Said they didn't have a nation anymore it was destroyed for 2,000 years but look at the text he says verse 28 you'll serve the gods the work of man's hands wood Stone which neither seen nor hear you know the Jews became secular do you know that in the 19th and the 20th century Judaism there are still some Orthodox Jews but for the most part most Jews don't even believe in God did you know that you're you're going to just worship the same gods that the people around you worship but notice verse 29 we're not done but from there from that place scattered around you will seek the Lord your God and you will find him if you search for him with all your heart and soul notice this verse 30 don't miss this in King James it says when you are in anybody have King James what does it say tribulation it says distress in The New American Standard but the word is actually the same word that's used in Daniel to talk about the time of Jacob's trouble that's coming upon the Jews in the end he's", "talking about the tribulation when you are in Tribulation and all these things have come upon you that's when you will seek the Lord with all your heart in the latter days those days are still yet ahead from our time you will then return to the Lord your God and you'll listen to his voice and God's going to forgive you because he's compassionate God's describing the whole history of Israel here what's happened before now into the times that we've lived in as still in the 20th century we're nearly completely wiped out in Europe God's judgment upon has been upon his people but even though they are faithless God remains faithful cuz he can't deny himself he doesn't reject them forever though they have lived in unbelief with severe consequences God says I am still going to fulfill my promises to you and when you are in so much tribulation that's going to take that for you to seek me you will find me don't you love that that's what Zechariah says God says they will they will look upon me whom they have pierced and they'll mourn for him as One Mourns for an only son and Paul says in Romans and all Israel will come to Faith In Jesus and you will hear my word yeah Moses and Elijah are going to be sent sent and 144,000 Jews for Jesus on fire Messianic Jews will be preaching the gospel to the rest of the nation in the Great Tribulation this is going to be lived out you guys God's getting them ready but he's describing it prophetically right before our eyes and I think to myself Lord what a beautiful thing that right here they don't know it I'm sure Moses didn't know as he wrote it not just something that might happen but something that we can look back on and say God so much of this has already happened and now we know we're on the verge of the rest of it being fulfilled amen it's amazing let's all stand and close with a song together let me pray for us as we're waiting father I just want to ask that you'd encourage those that are heart sick tonight those that are hurting I thank you that there is joy in the morning sometimes pain does last for the the night weeping can last for a time it feels like it's going to last forever but Lord would you turn that that morning into dancing would you bring resolve even even if it's just in their heart would you remind each of us that are discouraged that you're not dead", "you're not even sick and you've got a plan and I know it involves good for us you have you've told us your plans it's for our welfare and not for Calamity but Lord if we've forgotten our mission if we've gotten settled in on the blessings and we've gotten our eyes off of you if we've settled for Ministry rather than intimacy would you wake us up tonight would you help us to see that just because we're in faith right now doesn't mean that we always will be and we need to take these lessons and learn them well so Lord we might have our antennas up for way the ways the enemy is trying to help us be satisfied without you being our only God so help us to love you with all of our hearts in Jesus name nothing better than you Lord there's nothing nothing is better than you Lord there's nothing better than you Lord there's nothing better than you Lord there's nothing nothing is better than you you turn Graves into Gardens you turn vaults into armies you turn Seas into highways you're the only one who can you turn Graves into God hands you you turn bones into Aries you turn Seas into highways you're the only one who can you're the only one who can you're the only one who so just a final word to encourage you to consider you just sang it you turn Seas highways God says he'll make a path where there isn't a path that's what he did the Sea of Red Sea is not exactly a way to get across it's a way to get around somehow there was no way around what if you're in the middle of something that you see no way out of and God's going good I got him right there right now now will you trust me to find a way out of this that you don't see will you ask me to be that way maybe it's not an actual physical Escape out of the circumstance maybe it's about him being the way and going with you through the flood and Through the Fire didn't say he'd put the fire listen listen to me remember when Jesus gave that sermon it was probably the least popular sermon preached he said if you don't eat my flesh you have no part with me you don't drink my blood I call it the vampire sermon you know I mean I'm joking it's like people said this is weird see you have to eat his skin and drink his blood I'm out of here and people left and the", "disciples were watching Jesus give this message and letting people go and they did not understand they didn't go oh he's talking about communion he's probably talking about accepting him no they had no idea but Jesus was not concerned about the crowd leaving he was focused on his disciples believing and he said to them will you also leave this is your moment when nothing makes sense that I'm doing when it seems like I'm doing the wrong thing will you leave too others are or will you say what Peter said I don't understand why you did that I don't know what you mean by it but I'm going nowhere but following you out of here you have the words of eternal life even if I don't understand them and you've got me this moment when you're disappointed when you're discouraged when you see no way out that's your moment you don't get many of them just seize this one and tell them you have the words of eternal life take me out of here whenever you want or don't I'm with you God bless you", "maximum to the degree that I trust him you've heard me say this in Isaiah 9 it says of the increase of his government and of the increase of Peace there will be no end and I just I remind myself if I'm not feeling peace then I need to give him more government and so maybe you're here

they're 50 years praise the Lord you guys congrat congratulations we love you guys we know you're regulars here and we're happy to celebrate with you all right um oh by the way so I don't forget um if you haven't yet listened to Revelation chapter 1 I you remember if you were here on a Sunday morning one of the things that it says there is a special blessing for those who read for those who hear and for those who heed that is to obey the words of the Book of Revelation so we decided Well let's make it easier uh for those that don't have an audible version of the Bible so I recorded an audible version of Revelation 1 how many of you have already had a chance to listen to that feel free to go on our our uh uh Church app and you can listen to Revelation 1 but now we've done a video of it so you get to look at me reading Revelation one I I thought I liked it better before but anyway they said it'll be better we'll see but take advantage of that really we want to to take God at his word and if he says listening to it audibly and I do believe there's unique benefits of hearing the word of God read by somebody", "or spoken so take advantage and trust God and see what God will do uh as we go through that book together but tonight we're in Deuteronomy so uh Deuteronomy 12 Deuteronomy 12 we're going to start out with the first oh I think 10 verses then we'll get into the text these are the statutes the judgments which you shall carefully observe in the land which the Lord your the Lord the god of your fathers has given you to possess the land he's given you to possess as long as you live on the earth now you shall utterly destroy all the places where the Nations whom You Shall dispossess Serve their gods on the high mountains the hills under every Green Tree you shall tear down their altars smash their sacred pillars burn their asherim those are the Groves with fire and you shall cut down the engraved images of their gods and obliterate their name from that place you shall not act like this toward the lord your God but you shall seek the Lord at the place which the Lord your God will choose from all your tribes to establish his name there for his dwelling and there you shall come verse six there you shall bring your burnt offerings your sacrifices your tithes the contribution of your hand your vote of offerings your free will offerings and the firstborn of your herb and of your flock there also you and your household your family shall eat before the Lord your God and rejoice in all your undertakings in which the Lord your God has blessed you you shall not do at all what we are doing here today every man doing what is right in his own eyes for you have not as yet come to the resting place and the inheritance which the Lord your God has given you when you cross the Jordan and live in the land which the Lord your God has given you to inherit and he gives you rest from all your enemies around you so that you live in security let's stop right there father now we ask that once again long day for a lot of folks they're tired but they're here thank you when we just act in Faith Lord even if our bodies are tired or if we're distracted there's a blessing for us if we'll listen to your word receive it understand it and most importantly believe it and Obey it so would you help us now give us eyes to see and ears to hear what your spirit would say to us tonight in Jesus name amen here Moses giving instructions to", "the nation of Israel saying you know this is the last month before he's going to pass away and they're going to pass over into the promised land and so he's giving them instructions from the Lord uh it's the reiving of the law reminding them of the law that was given almost 40 years earlier up on Mount Si and encouraging them in wisdom of how to obey the Lord once they're in the promised land and so I've entitled the message the place of worship you can see the first 10 verses focus a lot on how to worship where to worship where not to worship so if you're taking notes worship is what we don't do and also what we do now it's a lot more than that but it does include both in our text to Worship the Lord in their case meant there's certain things that we weren't supposed to do and certain things that they were to do and the first principle for us in the first few verses is this don't copy the ways of the world around you if you're going to worship God that's going to be a principle you can't just do what the in their case the Heathen are doing around you in the land put it down don't copy the ways of the world around you in fact he gets very specific in the text when he says the God's given you the land to possess it as long as you live on the earth not until somebody else takes it over by the way you shall utterly destroy all the places where the Nations whom You Shall dispossess Serve their God so where idolatry is going on and he mentions three areas in specific he speaks of high mountains he speaks of the hills and under every Green Tree in other words idolatry was going on all over the place any place that was a high place they they would make shrines or altars to these to the Bales and to the various gods that they worship and then the asham these these were not high places these are actually Low Places but they this is where the sexual fertility rights were carried out and you got to remember when you're studying idolatry and I'll often remind you of this because I think a lot of Christians don't realize it and put the connection together idolatry in the Bible always with yeah sin but what kind immorality you'll find idolity idolity find idolity you'll find idolatry and immorality are connected and so much so when God says his people are worshiping Idols they're committing", "adultery against him spiritual adultery but there's a principle for us and we see it of course in the way idolatry was practiced in the ancient world there were these fertility rights there were these uh priests and priestesses of these temples that were actual prostitutes like in the city of Corinth even in the New Testament times and when you would worship these false gods you would be involved in sexual sin now that's foreign to most of us we don't think of any you know that being a typical church or anything but it's important that you see that those two are connected in the scripture so he says destroy every high place of idolatry that's connected with a low place of immorality you might say and I find it interesting that there's spiritual takeaways for us as Believers in the New Testament we're given a command jot it down second Corinthians 10 and verse 5 listen to what Paul says there Paul says we are destroying speculations and every well every lofty thing raised up against the knowledge of God and we are taking every thought captive to the obedience of Christ every place that we see this world's value system which isn't just sexuality or immorality but really it's just the focus of self pleasing self and acquiring stuff materialism uh we are to destroy that stronghold in our own lives you know we can't destroy somebody else's attraction to that we we're not supposed to change the world we can't change the world but we are not to get into the same things that the world worships we've talked about it many times but there in the Book of Genesis remember Abraham and lot his nephew were so blessed of God they were so blessed they couldn't stay together and too much cattle n enough grass and so you know Abram being the gentleman and trusting the Lord says you go whichever way you go and whichever way you go I'm going to go the other way and uh so of course we remember the story how lot looked and the plane was well watered and in that day not in this day by the way if you go with us down to the area of the Dead Sea you'll see there's no there's nothing growing there at all but in those days it was a beautiful paradise this plane that led down into the area of Sodom and Gomorrah and so the Bible you know Sodom and Gomorrah didn't have any of those negative connotations yet that we now know of them although it was a wicked", "place but for lot he chose what he could see he thought this is going to be a beautiful if you're giving me the choice I'm going you know we're I'm going to my cattle will do well so he chose a place that was great for raising cattle but not good for raising kids and we find out that when he first just pitches his tent toward Sodom and then after a while he's living in Sodom and he's even in the gates of Sodom somehow involved with city government I mean he got involved with the culture and of course we know what happened lot well as a result of that we'll be saved but kind of as the Bible says Through Fire literally meaning he'll get saved himself but he loses a lot doesn't he he loses he he loses his wealth he loses his wife he clearly lost his witness he's trying to minister to the two guys that are supposed to marry his two daughters and tell them that judgment is coming and they think he's making a joke they think it's a joke yeah that's never going to happen and so we see the effect of worldliness uh in his life and I think this is important when we think about what's the principle the nation of Israel is to go in and to exterminate all aspects of false worship lest it become a snare to them someone wrote this they said due to modern medicine and science we have vaccinations for many easily spread sicknesses and because of this this person wrote they said I've never suffered from polio or the Bubonic plague I hope not but there is still one disease that has reached epidemic levels and yet goes unchecked it's the disease of affluenza this sickness convinces people that money and material things are the things that will make them happy consider the following detrimental effects of affluenza one it keeps us from realizing our need for Christ humility and Desperation are the usual precursors for coming to Jesus but love of money masks that need remember the Rich Young Ruler went away sorrowful for he had great possessions secondly they affluenza can ruin the character of a generation and even ation studies reveal that children raised in wealth show many symptoms of those raised in abject poverty including depression and anxiety they experience despair sometimes attempting suicide they turn to alcohol drugs and addiction very interesting um someone said don't envy the super rich they are super miserable and I think that may be true thirdly affluenza can lead to less enjoyment of the possessions one has I", "think that's absolutely true when we have so much you know kids get spoiled and we as adults can be spoiled too in the continual pursuit of more and better uh the things you have today can't be enjoyed because they're not as good they're not good enough and you want something else contentment is not having all you want it's wanting all you have that's true Benjamin Franklin once said contentment makes a poor man Rich discontentment makes a Rich Man Poor so this person writes what can you do to help combat affluenza one writer recommends taking a family trip to a landfill or a garbage dump that's what they said the lines are shorter than at the amusement parks I guess so admission is free and little boys love it but as you and your family Meander through stop and look at all the piles of treasure that were formerly Christmas and birthday presents you see things that once cost hundreds of dollars things that children quarreled over things that friendships were lost over that Honesty was sacrificing for and that marriages were even broken up for it's a startling picture of how what the world values will one day end up in a junkyard well the bottom line is this that's one aspect of what the world worships is materialistic things but it is the way of the world there's other aspects of the world obviously we are not to copy any aspect of the world one of those is just leaving God out of our plans that's the way the world lives they don't consult God and you know what as Believers we can live like the world world when we do the same thing we say we believe or we do believe in God but we don't bring him into our thinking for instance when we don't give him thanks when we don't give gratitude to him this is where it the Bible says people who know there's a God but don't honor him in God start to go all right it's Romans 1 verse 21 things can get a lot worse in terms of sin but it begins with a very simple thing for even though Paul says they knew God meaning they knew there was a god they did not honor him as God or give give thanks but they became feudal in their speculations their foolish heart was darkened and it goes on to describe about how they walk away from the Lord into all kinds of sin and I think it's a good place for us to check ourselves hey do we give God", "thanks I'm not saying did you give him did you say grace at a meal that's one way but some of us can get into the habits of doing that we're not even grateful you know we we say thank you and then we complain about the food is this all there is and I don't even get seconds and this is my f it's like really who you fake it out there are you really grateful or are you just going through the emotions and really the Lord wants us to continuously be thankful do you know one of the evidences that you're filled with the Holy Spirit is not that you're speaking in tongues W you might speak in tongues but that's not what Ephesians 5 says I've read the list and speaking in tongues is is one of the things that will prove you're speak You're filled with the spirit no one of the evidences that you're filled with the spirit is you'll always be giving thanks for all things in the name of Jesus Christ that's evidence that someone is Spirit-filled let me ask you are you spirit filled are you thankful you're Spirit but that's one of the evidences that I have my heart in a right place the spirit of God is filling me I'm giving glory to God but also as I mentioned earlier is asking God permission not just doing by the way I find as as a pastor for many years and as a father and as a husband I have grandchildren and as I'm just kind of getting older it's easier for me me to fail in this area than it was when I was younger see when I was new at doing things whe whether it was my job or even in the ministry or in marriage or life with children I just had a lot of questions CU I had never done these things before so I would ask the Lord for help it's easier to not ask God for help when you've done stuff for a while when you're the person other people are going to well let me help you you know I got this one Lord very easy to decide and all of a sudden Proverbs 3:5 and 6 which is so basic it's on the bottom of the in and out cup I'm violating do not lean on your own understanding I can preach it but I got to live it it's harder to live than it used to be and the verses uh are in James 4: 13-16 for you notet takers James 4: 13-6 come now you who say hey", "today or tomorrow we're going to go to such and such a city and we're going to spend a year there and engage in business we're going to make a profit he says you don't even know what your life will be like tomorrow you're just a you're just a vapor you appear for a while and then you disappear that's it you vanish away instead you ought to say and mean if the Lord Wills we're going to do this and that in other words there's nothing wrong with planning don't get the idea of God doesn't it's sin to plan the Bible never says that go to the antto sluggard saves up for the in the summer for the winter that's honoring to the Lord look at what Joseph told Pharaoh man we're going to have some years of planning we better save up for the years of nothing wrong with planning it's Godless planning that's a problem it's when you're doing something and you don't even bring the Lord into it you don't ask him for permission you're not really relying on him there in lies the problem so that's the world's way though they don't ask the Lord for permission or wisdom and they certainly don't say thank you Ephesians 4:27 in the King James says something uh in the original Greek they're better than is The New American Standard here which says don't give the devil an opportunity but the word is an opportunity in the Greek it's the word is Place neither give place to the devil and I'm thinking about what God is saying to his people here you got to tear down all their altars don't just don't worship at them get rid of them they need to be gone don't give a place don't leave a place in your life where the devil has access to you now in the context there is talking about going to bed in Anger don't don't give the devil an opportunity don't don't go to let the sun go down on your anger but there's lots of ways we can give a place um to the devil when my grandchildren are at my house um we get stuff I'm not supposed to eat we get stuff I normally don't eat okay I buy it for them doesn't just show up and grow on the pantry I buy it and then they go home that's right there I got a little problem because uh it's very easy for me to get ins snared into well I'm just going to have a couple there's plenty they'll be back and maybe it's going to go bad you know", "it's going to go bad it's bad stewardship here to let this ships will taste better now than yeah so I joke around but the Bible says make no provision for the flesh right but I I kind of I excuse it I rationalize it now I'm not pretending the chips are a God to me but you know what it's the same principle it's like the Bible says clear out the old leaven you know get get rid of it well I don't I'll get rid of it you know um did you notice in the text it says you're even to get rid of their names did you see that in here in the text it says um in one of these verses that I didn't mention oh here it is in verse uh three it says cut down their engraved images of their gods obliterate their name from that place the name of these gods don't don't even don't even keep the name that they put on there well everybody knows that's not anymore we're changing the name very I mean how would you feel if your spouse wanted to name one of your children the name of somebody they used date yeah that would be like a no no no no or putting their picture up on the wall no God's saying the names got to go this this is not something that's going to be a part nothing valuable from that anything that replaces God in your life life in any way is an idol if something takes your affection attention off the Lord now God wants you to be busy at what he's called you to be it's not like well I got to go to work I hate work it's an idol I'm gonna just I'm G to fire myself today no but we all know that people can make their careers into their Idol they can bow down to it seven days a week and they can live you can do that with Ministry by the way too Ministry is very rewarding very fulfilling it's for God so you can find yourself deceiving yourself it's not like oh I don't have that problem anybody maybe more so I love my I don't call it a job it's not even a job how can it be a job when I love it so much my job isn't God be careful it's easy to deceive yourself into thinking that you're doing something that's acceptable to the Lord but actually taking your attention off if you don't eradicate it God says it'll hurt you later it will insens snare you", "we've talked all about this we talked about how God said you need to wipe out their worship you need to wipe them out get them out of the land if you don't and by the way when God says if you don't here's what's going to happen we know it happened so it's like God was right CU it happens they compromise with idolatry because they didn't obey the Lord so the principle for us is okay what are we allowing a little bit of something into our life and shouldn't be there and we we use these analogies we all agree how much if the doctor said I can get all the cancer or most of it well what that's like I does my HMO cover all cuz that's what I of course you don't of course you want it all right that that that's not even a question nobody even thinks twice about that but when it comes to sin when it comes to getting rid of things that we enjoy it's a little Well's a little someone wasn't me but I think it's worth said is not the church falling into this instead of destroying the world's way of worship is not the church falling into this when it turns Worship in into entertainment when it turns the sanctuary into a theater now I don't think there's anything wrong with plays and movies and and being creative I think those are honoring the Lord but when it's all about the audience having a good time or enjoying the congregation having fun and it's not about teaching the word of God regardless of the reaction something is not right worship is described in Romans CH 12 and verse 2 do not be conformed to this world this is the parallel to what's being taught here don't be conformed Believers to the world but be transformed by the renewing of your mind and then 1 Peter 1: 14 and 15 uh says this as obedient children don't be conformed to your former lusts which were yours in your ignorance before you were saved but like the holy one who called you be holy yourself in all your behavior so this idea of as a believer I'm to be no longer conforming myself to the world and I'm not to worship like the world worships or what the world worships put this down seek the Lord where and how he has told us to in verse six he says this uh well let's go to verse five you shall seek the Lord at the place he told them where you're not", "to go but then now here is where you are to go the place which the Lord your God will choose from all your tribes to establish his name there for his dwelling and there you shall come where was that place going to be not at first Shiloh is where the Tabernacle would be but here's the reality God gave gave his people a place and place changed a few times but there was always a place not places but a place they had to come to the Tabernacle to worship God later it'll be the temple they had to come to Shiloh wherever the that Tabernacle was and then it got moved eventually under David to Jerusalem and that was the place God chose for his name to be a physical Place God says you don't just go anywhere you go to a particular place to worship me and here's kind of the the principle for us the Old Testament Believers there had a place a specific place to worship New Testament Believers must worship around a person a particular person they had a place we have a person the location of your matter the name of your church doesn't matter what matters is that the worship is centered around Jesus Christ that is what matters remember what Jesus said wherever two or more gathered there am I midst and I think that's super important to understand it's it doesn't matter if you're here or there if it's all about him that's what matters you know um some of you grew up in the 60s some of you were already grown up in the 60s and some of you that was ancient history but there's a phrase that you've heard even if you are a newer generation because it's uh these are some of these phrases that were used a lot though back then in that era uh Live and Let Live uh to each their own do you remember that one two each their own Different Strokes for different folks that was so popular they made a TV show out of it um whatever floats your boat in other words um we're all independent we're all individual I'm not going to judge you you just do what you want what fulfills you and um that's fine now listen while worship true worship can be different very different in different places by the way one of the mistakes we make is by thinking every other church should worship the way we do or that we should worship the way they do and comparing them that's don't don't do that there's a lot of", "freedom to worship God in very different ways but while worship can be different and very different in different places listen to me it's never to be freelance it's an important principle to learn from this text the person who says I don't have to go to church to worship God I can do it wherever I want however I choose that's Wilderness mentality when you say I'll just do it my own way that's what God saying no no no you don't get to do that don't do that um in the Book of Judges the Book of Judges records the failure of God's people who fall deeper and deeper into depravity if I was to summarize the Book Judges it really is God's people falling away from the the Lord repeatedly God raising up judges to save them from the Captivity that they're brought into because of their depravity that they fell into and their immorality or their idolatry or whatever it was they worshiped the idols and and God brought them into judgment and then he raises up a judge over and over and over again but by the end of the Book of Judges I'll sneak peek to the end and tell you what happens you find the nation of Israel committing sins that were committed basically in Sodom and Gomorrah world was committing the these gross sins and now Israel is doing it and it's clear from the way the book is written God saying look how deep into sin my own people have gone with the Tribe of Benjamin and what happens at the end of the Book of Judges but what's interesting is the statement that's made about how that happens judges 21 and verse 25 it's kind of well it's the last verse of the book in those days there was no king in Israel notice what it says everyone did what was right in his eyes now the Book of Judges is preparing us for the monarchy and that there will be a king even though the desire for a king was not honoring to God the Book of Judges was saying things were a mess in our culture when there was no King there was no law and order it was a big it was problem and when people just do their own thing they're going to always be at odds with god um maybe you're familiar with the song and the philosophy I Did Way some people just love that song because I did it I didn't do it any other way I did it my no look you're supposed to be you that's fine and if", "it's just individualism praise God but there's something about that say saying that says you know I I'm I don't care what anybody says you know that that song belongs to Mr sin atra so don't try to steal it um biblical worship the place is the person of Jesus Christ but briefly talking about Place worship that honors God is not about a geographical place and by the way it used to be but it isn't do you remember the discussion Jesus had with the woman at the well about this very issue okay John 4 veres 20- 24 she says to him by the way she's subjects fathers worshiped in this mountain Mount gazim and you people say that it's in Jerusalem is the place we ought to worship uh Jesus said to her woman believe me an hour is coming when neither in this mountain nor in Jerusalem shall you worship the father you the Samaritans worship what you don't know we worship that which we know but Salvation is from the Jews but an hour is coming and now is when the true worshippers shall worship the father in spirit and in truth for such people the father seeks to be his worshippers God of spirit those who worship Him must worship Him in spirit and Truth very interesting it's not about a place it's now it was for Israel it was about to be in in Jerusalem in a while and God was saying there's a particular place but eventually even that would give way to the reality that worship true worship isn't about a particular place it's about a particular person Jesus is the living temple of God and God wants you to become the temple where he comes to live inside of you but it's very interesting it's about a personal orientation toward the lord spirit and Truth worshiping the Lord passionately and affectionately some people have never grown into that some people are afraid of their emotions why are you afraid of your emotions you say well you never know if that's really of the Lord and I don't like emotional things and I feel embarrassed listen to me God Made You with emotions worship god with your emotions don't trust your judge your emotions control your emotions but don't hesitate to worship god with your emotions David worshiped the Lord with all of his might and God has commanded us to love him with all of our heart soul mind and strength that's a physical attribute passionate affectionate worship and by the way that has to involve surrender and that's what Romans 121 says I urge you therefore Brethren", "by the mercies of God to present your bodies a living and holy sacrifice acceptable to God which is your spiritual service of worship affectionate passionate surrender not just emotions surrender if you're not surrendering anything to God that's just singing that's just feelings surrender but it also is spirit and truth and truth is always com straight out of the word of God what does God's word say about it what is it you're doing worship is a way of life it's not a song service at a church service it's the way you live it includes how you sing but really your worship isn't measured when you're singing a song it's measured by how you live your life that's the worship God wants put this down letter B entering God's promises brings rest and Security in verse 9 and 10 he says you have not yet come to the resting place that they weren't in the promised land yet and The Inheritance which the Lord your God has given you they're still on that other side of the Jordan then he says when you cross the Jordan and you live in the land which the Lord your God is giv you to inherit and he will give you rest from all your enemies around you so that you live in security so entering God's promises the result is it brings rest and security put this down little faith possesses but knows not that it possesses Proverbs 16 and verse 7 when a man's ways are pleasing to the Lord he makes even his enemies to be at peace with him now now that's a principle it's not 100% of the uh true all the time you say well you're saying the Bible's not true I'm saying take that verse and realize they killed Jesus okay when a man if when you're right with the Lord many times your enemies will be at peace with you that doesn't mean they won't hate you because you stand up for righteousness but there's a principle there King ASA in the Old Testament later on in the Bible's history fails to trust the Lord to defend him and the prophet comes to him and says from now on you're going to your sin your failure to trust God is you it's going to result in there won't be peace the Bible teaches that we enter if you will the promises of God like they were entering the Promised Land by faith why couldn't they enter the promised land they didn't believe God the only way they can go in in spite of the Giants in spite of the strongholds", "was to trust that God was going to keep his word and take care of them okay and that principle then is taught in the book of Hebrews that we as believers who TR Jesus for our Salvation we actually spiritually do what the first generation didn't do we get to enter the rest of God we don't have to work for our Salvation we don't have to worry about our Salvation Hebrews 4 and: three for we who have believed enter that rest so you need to see the application of what they failed and now we're being called to do you get rest and security when you trust the Lord but little faith possesses security but doesn't know that it does I've mentioned this many times but remember the the disciples on the uh Sea of Galilee there's a storm Jesus is asleep it's the only time we read of Jesus sleeping um I'm sure he slept other times but it's it's the only time it mentions that it's very interesting to me I I I I have all kinds of questions for him about that Lord did were you really were you peeking were you know I'm I'm sure he was asleep it says he was asleep but there's a storm I mean you know and and it's not just oh a little bit of rain a little bit of wind oh no this is a bad one I mean these fishermen who are used to the Sea of gal are saying we're going down I mean this is sub city they're going they're going to die they're can they're that's scary if the people who live on this sea and have been on the sea for years and years say we're not making it out alive and they come to Jesus they wake him up and they really kind of accuse him don't you care that we're all going to die and we remember what Jesus does of rebukes he rebukes the wind becomes perfectly calm I just I want to see it I to I just can picture you know then he rebukes the guys for not believing why did you you why did you fear and I think to myself what an interesting picture here Jesus is perfectly at peace in the storm he's not not thinking I'm about to die he's a we say he was asleep well I don't think he was troubled even after he woke up he didn't go why didn't you wake me up earlier this is terrible no he he knows he knows they're not going down listen to me the disciples were in", "no danger at all you say but there was a big storm I know but we know they weren't in any danger that's after the yes here's the point little faith he says oh ye of little faith little faith possesses is listen to me security but does not know that it security many believers who are afraid that they're going to lose their salvation is because they have little faith they are saved but they can't it because of little faith are you with me do you see the analogy between these disciples they were fine but they couldn't enter into the security that Christ had had and wanted to give them because of little faith it'll rob you of the blessings that are yours I'll put this down letter C know what God requires for true worship what God requires for true worship and then underneath that choose to worship how God chooses to be worshiped in verses 11-8 and then it'll come about that the place in which the Lord your God will choose for his name to dwell there you shall bring all that I command you your burnt offerings your sacrifices Tides contribution in your hand your choice vote of offerings which you will vow to the Lord and you shall rejoice before the God you and your family your sons and your daughters your male and female servants the priests the levite who is within your Gates since he has no portion or inheritance with you here invite invite the pastor over then verse 13 be careful that you do not offer your burnt offerings in every cultic place you see but in the place which the Lord chooses in one of your tribes there you shall offer your burnt offerings there you shall do all that I command you of course this is going to be Jerusalem however you may notice this verse 15 you may Slaughter and eat meat within any of your Gates whatever you desire according to the blessing of the Lord your God which he has given you the unclean and the clean may eat of it as of the gazelle and the deer Only You shall not eat the blood well I was thank you Lord I was really tempted I would I'm I'm glad that he said you can't cuz I wouldn't have anyway Only You shall not eat the blood you are to pour it out on the ground like water you are not allowed to eat within your Gates the tithe of your grain or new wine or oil or the firstborn of your herd or flock or any of your vot of offerings which", "you vow on your free will offerings or the contribution of your hand but you shall eat them before the Lord your God in the place which the Lord your God will choose so he says you can't just eat your your offerings that you're sacrificing to me in your backyard you got to go to the place that I'm designated to be worth there's one place okay you can't just do whatever you want however with regard to food he says you can eat meat but there is this provision you can't just uh do whatever you want wherever you want to so this idea of choose to worship how God chooses to be worshiped he specifies where and how he is to be worshiped and with whom they worship sometimes people say things like well why do I have to do this or why do I have to do that why do I have to give to the Lord you know why do I have to um gather with other Christians and go to church um why do I have to be whatever did you fill in the blank uh there was a guy talking to his friend and he said uh they he found out his this new guy know friend man he aaint he had met at work uh was a Christian and he goes oh that's neat he goes where do you where do you Fellowship he goes no I don't he goes what do you mean he goes I don't go to church he goes why not he goes well I mean I don't know thief on the cross uh Jesus said he went to heaven and he he never went to church he goes oh well he didn't have much of a chance but okay he said um well he said um where do you where do you give your contributions he goes but I don't do that either he goes you don't give to the Lord no goes well why not he goes Thief fall the cross never gave a Shuckle to the Lord and he he went to heaven goes well didn't where did did where did you get baptized he go thief on the cross never got baptized finally the guy said you know what um there's a difference between you and the thief on the cross he goes what's that he goes well the thief on the cross was dying in his faith but I think you're dead in yours when we're making excuses how we don't need to do the things the Lord has called us to do invited us to do to grow", "in our faith usually there's something wrong in our faith um here it talks about giving to God and we're to Rejoice give sacrificially and and rejoice now the Bible says God loves a Giver um the word cheerful in the Greek in the New Testament when Paul used it is the word hilarion guess what word we get we get the word hilarious in other words we're to really get to kick out of giving it should be a blessing to us worship is to be a get to not a got to and if it is a a got to I have to do it then be careful God God doesn't want you to be giving out of an obligation it's celebration I saw a bumper sticker years ago that said God loves a cheerful giver but he'll accept it from any Grump as well um but that's really the heart of the Lord is saying I'm not wanting you to be forced what blessing would it be to you to get somebody to give you a gift who didn't want to give you a gift you know I mean I suppose we teach our children okay we're going to give out names and you're going to give you know and sometimes we're trying to teach our kids say thank you thank you no no say it again but mean it thank you you know okay got to work on that you know I get it we got to teach our children some principles but but do you think the Lord wants you to go through the motions of doing something but your heart is nowhere near that Jesus said these people worship me with their lips but their heart is far from me how offensive would it be for you to have a relationship with somebody a spouse and and and to have them be do I have to say I love you okay I love you it's like wow that just oh man it just ministers in my heart that keep that no well God's wanting your heart he wants you to really this to be from you so interesting that heart that says do I have to I don't want to do cuz I have to something's not right there um here's a principle you're free to eat meat according to the text but you need to pour out the blood you're free to eat meat but you are to pour out the blood now basically what the Lord is saying is if you want to have a barbecue go for it it's fine fight your friends kill the gazelle kill the deer", "know I've had deer a few times they call him Bambi burgers this Lieutenant that prepared him for us absolutely terrible but um very gy but anyway um but you're know and uh if you're a mediate and I know there are people that make a big deal about uh the diets of Americans and eating meat too much red meat we do we eat a lot the Israelites did not eat a lot of red meat by the way they just didn't they didn't have it and the the they had cattle but they didn't go eating their cows that would be a big mistake because their cows were being used for other purposes particularly milk so they didn't eat meat and they offered them to the Lord they did wind up eating a lot it was it was a very smaller part of their diet so just the fact that God gives permission you know moderation in all things because we can kill ourselves doing too much of some things that are even good for us um but they were allowed to eat meat but they were never allowed to eat blood and we're told in the text why not because the life is in the blood isn't it interesting how God is pointing out something that Medical Science would discover for hundreds of years and then they'd realize wow the blood is the life you know they used to not that many well I mean a few decades ago but they used to blood let people you're sick what we need to do is let some blood out you got too much blood to imbalance in your uh they had these weird ideas about about medical science before they knew it's like we too much blood wrong balance get rid of some of that stuff GE it's not maybe we need more you're getting sicker okay we just drain it out of you it's like God saying don't you understand the life is in the blood you're not to be eating that now it's interesting he specifically says the blood has to be poured out and it should be obvious to us why because the sacrifices uh and and the blood of the animals becomes a picture of Christ's blood which was going to be shed and poured out on the ground when Jesus bled for us on the uh when he was whipped for us Zechariah 13 and 1 is a prophecy of the future cleansing of the nation of Israel in that day and I believe that day happens to be talking about the Great Tribulation if you were with us on", "Sunday we talked about they will look upon Him whom they have pierced and they'll mourn for him talking about Israel mourning for killing the Messiah but in that day a fountain will be opened for the House of David and for the inhabitants of Jerusalem for sin and for impurity and this is the text that was used as the basis of the hymn written in the 1700s there is a fountain filled with blood drawn from Emmanuel's veins and sinners plunged beneath that flood lose all their guilty stains I love that picture um we are not saved by The Life of now when I say that please understand I thank God for the Life of Christ I think too many times we neglect talking about the Life of Christ if Jesus Christ had not fulfilled the law he could not have us if he had not been sinless he could have not died for us so I am very grateful that Christ lived out the law made himself the perfect sacrifice but we're not saved because Jesus was sinless we're not saved because he lived out the perfect life and by the way we're not saved by his example either you know I find that most politicians when they're ask what's your favorite verse what's your favorite passage of scripture they almost all go to The Sermon on the Mount do unto others as you would have them do un you first of all that's about all the me Bible they know and they they it's like they the morals of Jesus the teaching je Thomas Jefferson loved the teaching of Jesus did not believe he died and rose again he actually they actually published a Bible the Jefferson Bible where there is no miracles no healing no Resurrection he just dies but man what a teacher we are not saved by The Life of Christ we are not saved by the example Christ I mean that's like somebody's drowning in a pool and the Lifeguard says just do this no it's not going to work you need someone to pull you out we are saved by the shed blood of Jesus Christ the giving of his life that it's so important that we we realize how important that is to God that he wants to underscore this now drinking blood was prohibited you weren't to take it in um what's interesting to me in the New Testament is Christ makes drinking his blood a salvation yeah you didn't know that oh let me let me share it with you John 6: 51-56 I am the living bread that came", "down out of Heaven if anyone eats of this bread he shall live forever and the bread also which I shall give for the life of the world is my flesh the Jews therefore began to argue with one another saying how can this be how can this man give his flesh Jesus therefore said to them truly truly I I say to you unless you eat the Flesh of the son of man and drink his blood you have no life in yourselves he who eats my flesh and drinks my blood has eternal life and I will raise him up on the last day for my flesh is True Food and my blood is true drink he who eats my flesh and drinks my blood abides in me and I in him if you go I don't understand that you're in good company cuz the crowd didn't understand it when Jesus said it either I call it his sermon that was the least checked out sermon in the tap Ling Library a bunch of the people said this guy's talking weird stuff I'm out of here remember a lot of them started to leave and I I've told you before I'm convinced Jesus Jesus said it up like I don't think he went oh second service I won't share that no he didn't take it out of his notes he purposed to say it he wanted that reaction why because he wanted he really wasn't concerned with the crowd he wasn't most of us are very concerned about what are the numbers but Jesus he was focused on the 11 you say don't you mean the 12 no he knew which one was going to betray him from the beginning he was focused on those 11 and he in some circumstances where people were walking away so he could ask him that question will you also leave are you going to take off too and you remember what Peter said see because it's something you're going to have to say too there's going to be times when what the Lord is saying what the Lord is doing don't make sense and he's going to ask you are you also going to go or maybe you're going to know somebody who's going to walk away from the Lord because of the circumstances in their life they don't understand God they don't like what God's doing there's no God or if there is I don't like them will you also leave it was all about that moment there's just a lot of different moments how that comes up in our lives maybe you're in one right now", "or maybe you're going to be in one soon what are you going to do now will you what are you going to do the lon is given to you by Peter just read it off the teleprompter where else could I go I'm not following them do you think Peter goes oh I understand you're communion uh blood and the about got it no he didn't get it I don't have anywhere else to go I don't have to understand the Lord or what the Lord's doing to trust him in fact my my faith is better measured when don't than when I do Jesus says these things about eating his flesh and drinking his blood it's not about eating his physical flesh or blood it's about internalizing the work cross that he died for me it's about personally internalizing the Forgiveness of God that comes through his blood alone I need to not just believe he died for Humanity I need to take it into me personally I love what Paul says in Galatians 2:20 what a beautiful corresponding verse to John 3:16 we all know John 3:16 for God so love the everybody what does Paul say in Galatians 2:20 I am crucified with Christ even though I am Cru meaning he died what he's saying there is he wasn't saying I was crucified physically but when he died he it was for me it was me cross I'm crucified with Christ nevertheless I live yet not I Christ lives in me the life which I now live in the flesh I live by faith in the Son of God who loved me not just the world you got to personalize it remember when Jesus said if anyone's thirsty spiritually come to me and believe no he he does want you to believe but you what's the analogy drink why would he say drink see I sometimes joke around with my grandkids or when I'm with people were let me playing rck of ball we've been playing a little rck of ball lately very little definitely not in shape but anyway when I get thirsty or something like that or they want to take a break you want to drink water no you go head there's a water fountain over there and I'll joke around you know get a sip for me too no I'm joking I'm not going to let them spit water into my mouth nobody can drink for you Jesus when he said if you if you're thirsty you've got to come to me yourself no it's not about joining a church this is about me and you you have", "to internalize by faith that's what it what I've done otherwise it's just head knowledge won't save you very interesting so I'm not surprised at the emphasis on understanding that the blood cannot be taken in the blood of animals blood of bulls and goats will never do you any real good as far as getting forgiveness the blood of Christ well that's different we talked about the other day but since we're on the text we have this understanding that blood the life is in the blood that's why God said when you kill a when a person kills a person you must take their life now I don't know what you believe about capital punishment and this is not speech about that but capital punishment was instituted by God because Man was created in the image of God and God takes it very personal when somebody attacks His Image by somebody and so he said if somebody does that their life must be taken the shed blood of the innocent the life is in the blood stands as a testimony even after the person has died as though the blood is still alive and and it's communicates remember when Cain killed Abel remember this Cain buries him God comes to him Genesis 4 and says where's your brother and he says beats me that's in the Hebrew am I My Brother's Keeper and God says oh do you think I know I see him right over there then he said it this way the blood of your brother cries to me from the ground now what was it crying well we know it's crying remember the in the Book of Revelation we see the under the altar those who were beheaded for their faith in Jesus Christ and their crying out to the Lord how long holy and true does thou fail to avenge our blood on them that dwell on the earth in other words this is unjust they killed us they took our lives you need to judge them you're a just God you've commanded this it's got to happen and he says be patient it's going to happen the blood of the righteous Christ for God to act even if nobody else is crying out on the on behalf of The Unborn their blood is crying out to God but the writer in the book of Hebrews picks up this concept you know it's interesting that that blood should cry out about someone's guilt if you think about modern science now with DNA literally these murder cases of my goodness I mean you can watch 2020 and just all these shows on Forensic Files", "and the DNA literally is crying out guilty guilty right over there right it's do I mean it happens but in Hebrews 12 and verse 24 there's an interesting statement about Jesus it says we've come to Jesus the mediator of a New Covenant and to the sprinkled blood which speaks better or louder than the blood of Abel why because the blood of Abel says guilty the blood of Christ for us guilty Justified it's an amazing forgiven that's what the blood of Christ does put this down number three no imitation worship is acceptable to the Lord in verse 26 only your holy things which you may have and your vode of offerings you shall take and go to the place it's all about the place which the Lord your God chooses and you shall offer your burnt offerings the Flesh and the blood on the altar of the Lord your God and the blood of your sacrifices shall be poured out on the altar of the Lord your God and you shall eat the flesh but be careful to listen to all these words which I am commanding you so that it may be well with you and your sons after you forever for you will be doing what is good and right in the sight of the Lord your God and when you're when the Lord your God cuts off before you the Nations which you are going in to dispossess and you dispossess them and dwell in their land beware that you are not ens snared to follow them after they are destroyed before you and that you don't inquire after their God saying how do these nations serve their gods that I may also likewise you shall not behave thus toward the lord your God for every abominable act which the Lord hates they've done for their gods for they even burn their sons and their daughters fire to their gods don't copy the worship of the Nations who God says destroyed it's kind of like God saying you know would you would you follow somebody that walked off a cliff I mean I know our mother said that to us with our friends well my friends would you you know Matthew 15 and verse1 14 Jesus talked about the Pharisees who were respected by the culture he said let them alone they're blind Guides of the blind if a blind man guides a blind man blind uh another blind man they're both going to fall into a pit um so our worship is different than the worship of the world when the children of Israel were in Egypt Pharaoh tried to", "compromise with Moses who was saying let let us go we need to worship Our God and sacrifice to our God he goes well just go just stay in the land and go go worship your God and Moses we can't do that no we can't do that because if we do the Egyptians will Stone us to death why well because we're going to offer up an animal that they worship that will not go over well with the Egyptians it's very we we can't we we don't worship the way the world worships so we we aren't going to get sucked into caring about valuing and going after the things the world gives uh gives so much value to such as wealth uh 1 Timothy 6:10 1 Timothy 6 and verse 10 the love of money is a root of all sorts of evil and some by longing for it have wandered away from the faith and pierced themselves with many a pain letter D on your outline neither add to nor subtract from God's word it's interesting in a passage all about worshiping how the the chapter ends look at verse 32 whatever I command you you shall be careful to do and you shall not add to nor take away from it adding to and subtracting from the word of God is the problem of people who believe in the Bible let me say that again adding to or subtracting from the Bible is the problem of people who claim to believe in the Bible um put this down by adding to What God Says you become legalistic and then by subtracting from what God says you can become licentious lenti you say how do you spell that doesn't matter no one's checking this is Illustrated so well this problem of adding and subtracting to God's word in the New Testament by two groups of people who are theyes the Pharisees sades and the Sadducees who we tend to just know they both hate Jesus and they did for different reasons by the way they hated each other they were the exact opposite sides of the aisle in terms of conservative and liberals who was were you can deduct who is liberal I have to ask the question the Pharisees are the ones who added to the word of God they believed the whole Old Testament and then some the writings of rabbis and um the Sadducees on the other hand they were the subtractors they accepted the five books of Moses but they did not accept miracul miraculous experience they didn't believe in healing they didn't believe in angels or demons and they didn't", "believe in Resurrection after the dead so it's very interesting we see these kinds of behaviors lived out the Pharisees became extremely judgmental of other people they're the sin sniffers of their day very much so but not just based on what God Said but based on what they thought God meant and what happens is when you are adding to the word of God you you you deduct things you come up with principles maybe the Lord calls you to do something and you you're blessed in it and as a result you start looking at other people going well why aren't they doing it I have no problem when the Lord ministers to someone says I've decided I'm not going to do this anymore great honor the Lord I don't watch TV anymore good right on I remember I've I've been there you don't praise the Lord that's a lot of junk on that TV you probably you know just DVR of the good stuff or don't so I get it the problem isn't when the Lord shows you to do something that helps your walk the problem is the way you start to look at other people who haven't had that conviction yet well I'm praying for them or looking for a church of no TV I think there are better Thrones in heaven for those that didn't watch t yeah it's becoming holier than thou is the problem when all of a sudden what was good for you becomes a negative thing and Satan has found a way in he couldn't tempt you into sins so he tempt you into pride and there were these kids they were teenagers and they were talking to their and they were saying you know when we're old enough we'd like to try champagne she goes no never never never never well Mom you know I'm not talking about getting drunk I'm just talking about trying you know having a glass of wine never he said well you know Mom I know you love the Lord but you know even even Jesus changed water into wine yes and he shouldn't have done it either okay that's a little too far um but this attitude of the Sadducees they were the Liberals they were the ones involved with politics by the way it's very interesting I'm not saying everybody who's political is a liberal I'm just saying that they were politically motivated and materially Wealthy they're the ones who ran the temple they had power and authority um they're the ones who had trouble with Jesus turning over the money changers t in what we're known as the bizar of Anis", "cuz they were making Buu bucks on that Hustle but when a person says I know what God says about not having sex before marriage but I feel it's okay cuz love so I have a piece about it so I'm going to I'm going to do it well I know what God says about how he hates divorce but I'm not happy and God wants happy are the people who's God as the Lord so I'm I feel led or I know I'm not supposed to marry a non-Christian but I really do feel uh that God's leading me to do it and I say you're probably listening to your hormones and not the Spirit I know God says I should be in the habit of fellowship with other believers but it's boring I'd rather home no offense I'm glad you're watching I'm trusting you're watching if you're not watching no offense taken because you didn't hear me I know Jesus said to forgive people people when they sin against you but that person's a jerk and it's not going to happen they started it I know that Jesus says when someone sins against you you're supposed to take the initiative and go talk to them and seek a healing in the relationship I just don't want there's no end of saying I know what God says I'm just not going to live under that I'm not going to obey that um adding to the word of God is usually the temptation of people who really love the word as it was for the Pharisees and that's why they weren't see the Sadducees who didn't believe it all that's why they were sadu they didn't believe in miracles they didn't believe in healing they didn't believe in Resurrection so hey that'll get you so this chapter is about worship it's very interesting to me we as Christians tend to think of worship as what we do before a church service or the music we listen to on the way to work and there's nothing wrong with that I'm not going to say that we're not going to change the culture and say don't call that worship call it singing no it's fine but keep in mind the Lord has a whole different perspective of worship worship worship is about surrendering to the Lord I'll be honest when I sing I it helps me to surrender to the Lord it helps me to get ready do you know why we sing before I teach well I don't know we always do no there's something spiritual about worship when you enter into it in the", "Old Testament one of the prophets who's trying to hear from the Lord you know what he says I want to hear from the Lord bring me a minstral bring me somebody to play some music do you remember when Saul had a demon and he said man I need someone to play some get David over here to play some that some of those psalms you know Psalms alive give me some of the music Mir not the music here and he he was worship does something for us emotionally and spiritually that kind of prepares us it should for the word of God and that's why we spend time in worship it's why I spend time in worship before I teach I just want to be focused on the Lord I don't want to be thinking about what I'm gonna say I should have already done that so so going I no this you don't really know what you're going to say sometimes okay sorry but my heart is to have my heart in the right place so that I can share my heart as best I understand it with you but worship is about a lifestyle it's about a relationship with Jesus it's not about going to church or not going to church there are plenty of people that go to church every Sunday who never worship and you can Worship the Lord anywhere you are and everywhere you are you can start worship if you didn't worship tonight you can worship as soon as you leave this is about you and him father we are grateful that this building is not the place to worship even though it is a place where we can because We Gather in your name name I thank you that some are going to go out to eat right now and you can be there with them that wherever you are Lord worship can happen and we can even worship with just alone with you it's amazing not gazim not Jerusalem not Calvary Chapel East only but since your spirit is everywhere and since Jesus you go with us and will never leave us I want to worship you when nobody here is watching me tonight I want to worship you before I go to bed and when I first wake up I want to live in your presence help me God to be a better worshipper in Jesus name I pray amen amen let's all stand death could not hold you before you that is the Bo of are PR of your lord for you are rais to again

you and give you his shalom in the name of the father and the Son and the Holy Spirit one last thing you're a temple if you're a Christian you're a temple of the Living God who is in you he lives in you you don't have to go to some Temple you don't have to go to some building to worship God God intends for worship to be happening inside of you there should be fragrant prayers that bless the Lord coming out of your life people should come close to the tent of meeting which is you because they see and sense that God's spirit is in your life may God draw people to himself s through what he's doing inside of you God bless you", "page Lord is going to be with us in eternity and Lord we won't we won't take out of it tonight everything that's here but we do ask for those things that we need tonight we ask for the things we need to learn or relearn teach us about Isaac's faith teach us how to have a faith that's healthy Lord living in this world we pray you give a strength energy and really answer the desires of our heart as you open your word to us for we ask it in Jesus name Amen you can be seated so I remember the night as though it were tonight it was a long time ago now but I was a I had been a Christian for about four years and maybe like some of you you know I prayed to receive Christ I knew that God was real I knew Jesus was alive I knew he had changed my life and just excited about being a follower of Jesus but I was also you know in a way struggling for a long time I would see certain friends of mine who had come to the Lord and they were living for the Lord they were witnessing to other people you know they were growing in their prayer life and in their know to the Bible and you know I believed in the Bible I believed in prayer I believed didn't witnessing I just did to it and I remember as a young Christian feeling like what's wrong with me why is it other people seem to have giftings why is it other people seem to have zeal for the Lord and a desire to serve Him and I I just don't know that I am a very good Christian and I tried hard I even tried harder it didn't seem to do much at all and I came to a point in my life I was in college now and where I just remember one night I was at a it was a Bible study and I was just feeling so discouraged and I remember feeling like I just want to give up I just want to give up this is not working I mean my I'm I'm a failure as a Christian and that night it just so happened that nobody knew I was feeling that way but the guy who was leading the Bible study invited people that were there to make a total surrender to the Lord and he didn't have us raise our hands there was no altar call it was a small group maybe about 15 of us college-age kids and so", "he said if you want to if you want to do you just pray this prayer that I'm gonna pray then he prayed a brief Burak okay I'm tell you what he prayed but I prayed that prayer just quietly in my heart just kind of really more discouraged still thinking I'm so sorry that's me I'm just blowing it but I do I give up Lord and and you know it was almost like I felt like God was saying I've been waiting for you to say that because literally that night not only did I feel encouraged after I had prayed this prayer of consecration but something radically started changing and I don't mean in the next few years I mean in the next few minutes after I prayed that prayer and the way it manifested itself in my life is that I started wanting to read my Bible some of you've heard me show this before I was a TV addict you know some of you who are my age realized how could you know so many stories from the 60s and 70s and TV shows I've forgotten all that junk and well because I watched too much of it and so I I would the first way that experience experience started changing my life as I would have regular shows that I would watch like some of us have now maybe but certain you know it wasn't you couldn't record things back then this is before VCRs even this is way back me and Fred Flintstone you know and but I remember you know certain nights my shows were on well I read that with my children but certain was I really liked I like cop shows and detective shows him and so I remember I was walking in to go watch one of my shows and and as I was walking in the Holy Spirit I know it was God spoke to me and he said he'll read my word and I remember feeling it like well Lord I can't right now I'm gonna go watch Mannix or whatever it was I was gonna go watch and but the Lord just spoke to me again and I never heard God speak to me really I didn't but I heard this really clear Meyer go read my word and I thought I really don't want to but if you're telling me - then I I'll do it and I'm gonna miss the but although and that it was as simple as that I turned around walked back to my bedroom open my Bible started reading my Bible I don't know what I read but I", "do remember when I read it it was different than I had ever read it before it was like God was speaking directly to me this time and I was spending time with the Lord I wasn't just doing something religious that I should have done that's kind of how it began but the more I read the more I wanted to read and God started a fire within me for my relationship with him it wasn't for ministry it wasn't designed about it was something like that it was just about a passion that God placed in my heart to know him well I would come to understand that didn't know what it was at the time that what God had done has baptized me in the Holy Spirit that night it was shortly after that actually I turned 18 I got baptized in water and God called me into the ministry that I think about that when I think about this passage listen Abraham as you study the life of Abraham you'll find that just about everywhere he went he built anybody no altars if he goes somewhere he builds an alter ego so morose he builds an altar Ben said he was an altered man and Isaac however especially in this chapter but his life is really associated not so much with building altars although he does build one in this text really it's associated with digging wells which is some fascinating typology for us when it comes to water obviously water in the Middle East as it is everywhere in the world is precious and especially in Israel so much of their water they have to when they when they when it does rain in a short time that it does rain they have to hold onto it in cisterns because literally they couldn't have any crops they would die because it's such a arid land and so water is life still in the Middle East to our David especially in the ancient world so God uses water as a symbol of himself jotted down Jeremiah 2 and verse 13 listen to what God said to the people of Israel through Jeremiah he said my people have committed two evils first of all they have forsaken me who are you lord I am the fountain of living waters and here's the second thing they've done they not only have forsaken me but they are hewing or carving for themselves cisterns even broken cisterns that can hold no water in other words they're trying to replace me with other things in their life that will never work and so often it's not just you know", "the world's that's do it he's talking about his people we have this tendency we know the Lord but we ignore the Lord we forsake the Lord we try to replace the Lord for satisfaction and it never works and it's as ancient as God's people are another fascinating passage is numbers 21 verses 16 and 17 numbers 21 it says of God's people for there they continue to be by the way the word beer I know what it means in English it means well don't see that here tonight for they continue to the well that is the well where the Lord said to Moses assemble the people that I may give them water then Israel sang this song spring up oh well and sing to it now remember when the children of Israel came out of Egypt they're following maybe a million and a half of them after Moses and following after the Lord who is leading them by the pillar of cloud by day pillar of fire by night to the promised land and while they are there in the wilderness it's not long before they run out of water on purpose God and wants them to go through this but they're thinking they're out here and they're gonna die of thirst and so God calls Moses to gather the people together and he said stand before the people at Mount Orab and he said here's what I want you to do you take that staff Moses and you smite the rock right in front of everybody and when you do water is gonna pour out and I'm gonna provide for my people this miracle happens which by the way is interpreted in the New Testament first corinthians that the rock is a type or a picture of jesus christ you say what do you mean well that that it's this that he is the source of life but only after he is smitten and so Jesus Christ dies on the cross and becomes the source of eternal life to men it's a beautiful picture but God told Moses to do that it physically happened and literally water for a million-and-a-half people to drink and have provision for their trip however later on an interesting thing happens many of you remember this that they become thirsty again sometime later and so God says gather them together again and this time he doesn't tell him to smite the rock what does he tell Moses to do speak to the rock just speak to the rock and water will come out that's a very interesting thing Moses kind of loses his cool he gets mad at", "the people so I bring water from you stiff he's all ticked off and so what does he do he hits the rock again with his staff twice and water does come out but God has a problem well Moses has a problem but God takes Moses to task and said you're not gonna go into the Promised Land you didn't treat me as holy before my people in other words you're ticked off I'm not they need water you didn't obey me now it's a very interesting type the rock is picture of Christ it must be smitten but it's only smitten once Jesus Christ does not have to repeatedly die for our sins to provide for our needs once he is smitten all you have to do is ask all you have to do is speak to the rock and that water that type and picture of the Holy Spirit is available to you so we're gonna talk a little bit about the idea of this well and these wells that are being built and learned some principles about the Holy Spirit tonight so the first principle is this it's pretty obvious in the text and that's the enemy seeks to stop the flow in our lives the enemy seeks to stop the flow in verse 15 take a look back here we see though all the wells which his father's servants had dug in the days of Abraham the Philistine so they're sort of the enemies of God's people stopped them up by filling them with earth that's kind of interesting to me if the water is a type and a picture of the presence of God and the power of the Holy Spirit how does the enemy stop the flow of the life that comes from God it's the dirt of the world that is exactly the case he uses the dirt of the world to clog up and choke off the flow of God's presence and God's power in our life and I want you to jot down mark 4 and verse 19 remember what Jesus said this is part of the parable of the sower but the worries of the world the deceitfulness of riches and the desire for other things enter in and choke the word and it becomes on fruitful take a look down in verse 16 then Abimelech he's the king of Gerar said dies and go away from us for you are too powerful for us very interesting here's a guy God is blessing him if you read the verses right before this God has blessed him a hundredfold he's becoming wealthy he's digging wells which is good for him", "and good for everybody but his blessing is becoming a problem to the people of the land even the king and I think about when Jesus came to Ghaderi Ghaderi is not a Jewish city of the ten cities of what's known as the Decapolis it's a Greek city and yet there were some Jews that lived there but they're also Gentiles most Jews would not even go there but Jesus came with his disciples across the Sea of Galilee and entered into Ghaderi and you remember the welcoming committee of Ghaderi yeah wasn't the mayor of the people it wasn't the Jews it was just one guy a guy who we would say was absolutely nuts because this man was demon-possessed had a Legion of demons of demons inhabiting him out of control lived in the tombs used to take rocks and cut himself and bleed and scream and yell I mean he must have been an absolute nightmare for this town of Ghaderi and Jesus well actually the man runs out to Jesus we know who you are Jesus of Nazareth the demons are speaking I mean it's this crazy scene and you remember what happens how that Jesus commands the demons to leave the man and go into what yeah a bunch of pigs which tells you a little bit about how Jewish this was this community but he cast them into the pigs the pigs run down the hill and they drowned themselves but the man is is released from the from the demons which has got to be a beautiful thing the man is I love this verse it just says that the man is next seen sitting at Jesus's feet which just remember that's where Mary was sitting when he said to his sister hey get him on this he's sitting at Jesus's feet he's clothed how long has it been since the guy wore anything I don't know somebody gave him two blows or Jesus been a manifest I don't know but he's wearing clothes and more importantly than everything is in his he's been saved he's been rescued by Jesus and all he wants to do is go with Jesus and Jesus says no you know I can't do that but what's very interesting is this beginning of a work of Ghaderi you I've always thought they should make Jesus the town hero or the mayor or something you know but what did the people of the town come out and say to same thing that Abimelech is saying to Isaac please leave we don't want you here even though God is using you God is", "blessing you and it's good for us we don't want you here and that's a very interesting thing to me that whether it's the fiction of the Holy Spirit on the unbelievers around us or jealousy which evidently would that was part of the problem they were envious by the way do you know why the leaders of Israel delivered Jesus up to the Romans envy the Bible says it was Envy that was their motives they did not like how it how popular Jesus was becoming among the people and so because of that they delivered him up I think of Paul there in acts 16 is in Philippi and he's been called by the Lord to go minister he had that vision of the Macedonian man come over and help us he gets over there remember he's ministering to delidio and down by the riverside the handful of women that get you know they had the word and but there's this little slave girl and every day Paul's going out to minister is following him and she's demon-possessed and she is actually advertising who he is he's he's happy she's saved the truth about who he is preaching the gospel and but it's coming from a little girl who's demon-possessed and so he cast the demon out of the girl now everybody should say thank you she's been demon-possessed I was so nice what do they do know we're going to arrest you we're gonna beat you because we were making money over by her fortune-telling in the same way the same things happening when the Spirit of God is on your life and using you there will be people who don't appreciate it even though it should bring a blessing to them they would like you just to be gone and so interesting he's this this whole thing with the wealth there's they're trying to clog it up they're trying to stop the flow you know I shared with a man who doesn't attend our church but he's a worship leader and we were talking about the days of revival in the 70s and we were talking he asked me you know when I started attending Calvary Chapel I said over in the tenth days in 1973 and he goes man I wasn't even alive back then you know I hear all these stories but but I wasn't even born yet but but here's the reality who cares what God did in the past is not you're not have no loss if you didn't live through the tenth days why because Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever what he did historically is", "irrelevant what's important to know is that he's available present to do everything that he wants to do right now but you can't just like Isaac can't inherit the wells from his father Abraham you and I cannot inherit or reproduce a previous generations experience with the Holy Spirit so even though the enemy's putting all this dirt in there to close up the fact is it also tells us the Lord wants to do something new in our generation right now in our generation jot down lamentations 5 and lamentations 5:21 a good prayer to pray restore us to you O Lord that we may be restored renew our days as of old and it's interesting it says that Isaac gave the same names to these wells right because it's the very same Holy Spirit that will move today in your life who moved in the days of the book of acts or at any revival throughout history jot down John 7 and verse 37 look at why you're joining that down look at verse 19 in our text but when Isaac's servants dug in the valley and found their a well notice of flowing water now this is different usually well water is not flowing water so they dug down they actually found a spring is what this is talking about which is fascinating to me then the herdsmen of Guerard quarrelled with the herdsmen of Isaac saying the waters ours flowing water or what would be called normally living water by the way I think some people don't know this we all think of living water as well that's the Holy Spirit it's true it's a picture of the Holy Spirit but living water in the Bible means spring water water that's actually bubbling up from the ground not just a pool of water not a pond not actually a river particularly but spring water and if you've ever drank from an actual spring you know how good that water takes well Jesus uses this this word to speak of the power of the Holy Spirit in John 7 and verse 37 it says now on the last day the great day of the feast Jesus stood up and cried out saying if anyone is thirsty let him come to me and drink and then John says that he was speaking of the Holy Spirit when he said out of his innermost being shall flow what rivers of living water and then John says this is he spoke about the holy spirit who was not yet given because Jesus Christ had not been glorified our kids from time to time", "sing a song dig down deep and there's still more dig down deep it's a well without a floor in other words the the depth of what God's Spirit wants to do in our lives we haven't exhausted it we haven't reached it God wants to do far more and so they find it well or they dig dig it up and there's a problem there's contention with the people of the land so they named it exact which means contention and then it happens again and they name it sit now which means enmity it's interesting because those are two of the works of the flesh and the New Testament that quenched the Holy Spirit spoken about in the book of Galatians enmity strife problems with other people those are ways to grieve and quench the Holy Spirit it happens in our life too you go you know you're filled with the Holy Spirit you get up you can't wait and then you get on the freeway and sewing okay kind of lost it there and I'm not talking about getting in a bad the fact is sin separates us from God and now it doesn't mean you lose your salvation but God says this my ear is not dull that it can't hear my arm is not short that I can't say but your sin has made a separation between me and you we need to get restored to the Lord the psalmist said if I regard iniquity in my heart God won't hear my prayer so when we move into the day and we don't allow the Spirit of God to lead us and fill us and give us as patients with other people but in our flesh we react and respond and get mad and frustrated we we grieve the Holy Spirit we quench the Holy Spirit and so here we have these wells being dug and the enemy not being pleased with it and I like the fact that he just keeps digging because I think you know sense for people maybe you're here in this room you feel like I don't know what you're talking about about the Holy Spirit you know the Holy Spirit is anchorman of the Trinity we all study and know a lot about the Father we've had fathers and of course Jesus is our focus the Holy Spirit is kind of an enigma to a lot of Christians what is the Holy Spirit do you know well the Holy Spirit is engaged and involved with your Christian life from before you're saved until you're glorified in heaven and every day along the way from the", "point of convicting you of your sin before you come to Christ to the regeneration of your spirit to moving in and living in the side of you know we say Jesus lives and it's actually the Spirit of Christ inhabits us and he begins to sanctify us to make us more and more like Jesus he's the one through whom you feel the presence of God he's the one who convicts you of sin when you blow it he's the one who remind you you're really a child of God he's the one who cries out within you Abba Father to help you to know you're God's child he's the one who who reveals God's will and God's Word within your heart and speaks to you he's the one who gifts you to be used in the body of Christ he's the only use of the power to witness to other people the work of God in your although the Holy Spirit doesn't usually take the credit for it because he's always focusing on Jesus is it working every believer in this room but I have a question for you have you ever been baptized and filled with the Holy Spirit I have a more important question than that maybe are you being are you living in a relationship where you feel like the Spirit of God is filling you on a regular basis and using you in a way that you know that's impossible except that God was in charge of your life how badly do you desire that work and do you know how to allow that work to even happen I want you to jot down a verse Luke 11 and verse 13 here's what Jesus said about the Holy Spirit he said if you then being evil meaning we're human that is sinful by nature know how to give good gifts to your children how much more will your heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to those who ask and continue to ask him I remember saying Lauren I want you to control me I want you to have my life completely but I don't know how to do that and I think that there are some Christians who give up they pray a prayer once or twice they read a book they hear a sermon and then they become discouraged when it doesn't happen I think it's fascinating to me in the text that there's a process somewhat of a frustrating process for Isaac to go through until he finally is able to dig that well in that broad place and he realizes okay finally now I can become", "fruitful remember in John 15 how Jesus said I am the vine you are the branches my father's the vine dresser every branch that abides in me will do what bear fruit in other words the key of having the life of Christ come into me and through me to become like him his character that is the fruit of the Holy Spirit becoming like it's his life flowing through you remember his staying connected to him long enough when a branch stays connected long enough it will bear fruit that's it so it's keeping from being disconnected that is so important that we learn how to do that now so the first principles the enemy seeks to stop the flow and maybe he's been very effective in our lives to do that but there's more we need to meet God at the well so if you want to jot that down a little verse 23 then Isaac went up from there to bear Sheba by the way bear Sheba is in the southernmost part of Israel and what's called the Negev and it's deserts by the way it's one of the larger cities in Israel over 200,000 people live there today but it is considered the southernmost city because you'll hear people in the Bible talk about all of Israel from Dan to Beersheba and down the south but so he went up from where he was in Gerard to the Lord appeared to him the same night I find him interesting as soon as he's in this place where Sheba means the well of the oath or the well of seven could mean either one and here as soon as he gets there at the well I he hears God say I am the God of your father Abraham don't fear I'm with you I'll bless you and multiply your descendants for the sake of my servant Abraham look at the reaction verse 25 he builds an altar there like his like his dad and he calls upon the name of the Lord and he pitches his tent there and there Isaac's servants dig a well now Beersheba is already known as the place where oats are made before this in fact Abraham has signed a covenant with Abimelech so has Isaac here at Beersheba so it's a place where men have entered into an oath with the king but it's interesting when Jesus talks about the Holy Spirit one of the names of the Holy Spirit is he calls him the promise of the Father in the Gospel of Luke he tells his disciples to stay in Jerusalem till the promise of the father is sent", "upon them and I love this picture I've Beersheba there's this working out of the oath the the receiving of the promise of God upon Isaac and just like in the book of Acts when the Holy Spirit was poured out on the disciples but look at all that the Lord does at the well everything that you and I want he reveals himself at the well as soon as he gets there he speaks his peace he promises his presence he starts promising blessings upon him and his children by the way he gives him the Covenant that was based totally on grace for the sake of another it's really a picture of all we have in Jesus Christ when you think about it siege through Jesus Christ we receive God's presence we receive God's promise of blessing for the sake of Jesus Christ and of course we received his peace and the response of what happens at the well you might say the response is something that's filled with the Holy Spirit how what happens when you're filled with the Holy Spirit the same things that have in our text look again at verse 25 what does he do when he hears from God at the will he builds an altar there what does an altar speak of consecration exactly what happened to me there in 1975 at that meeting when the Spirit of God came on me I just surrendered my whole life to the Lord that is your response how do you know when you're filled with the Holy Spirit you don't want to hold on to any of your life anymore you just want him to have full control so he builds an altar an ultra speaks of personal sacrifice and of worship chop down Romans 12 and verse 1 Paul said therefore I urge you brethren by the mercies of God presents your bodies a living and Holy Sacrifice acceptable to God which is your spiritual service of worship so first of all it's consecration but then notice in the text after he builds the altar the next thing he does he calls on the name of the Lord so first consecration and then supplication because we're talking here about prayer what does it say the Ephesians 5 when you're filled with the Holy Spirit what will you do somebody tell me what it says will happen howdy what's the evidence you're filled with the spirit according to Ephesians 5 anybody know don't be drunk with wine but be filled with the spirit what will happen what does that look like anybody know over here yes okay go ahead you'll sing", "psalms hymns spiritual songs and make melody to the Lord there's gonna be communication when you're filled with the spirit one of the evidences is not only are you dedicating your life to the Lord but you're starting to communicate to the Lord more than you ever did your prayer life will start to change if you're filled with the Spirit of God and then not only will you be making melody which is a joyful communication to the Lord but also it says you'll be giving thanks for all things of the name of Jesus Christ more prayer but it's not Lord I'm so bummed out I'm so worried I'm know you're thankful for where you are even if things haven't changed at all he's gonna change you from the inside but you're gonna start communicating your consecrating yourself are starting to be involved in active communication with the Lord new appetite for the Word of God for sure you start to hear God speak to you just like Isaac did this is only the second time we read in Isaac's life where God spoke to him but God has a lot to say to him and it's all very very encouraging him and that's encouraging the words that God speaks them there's no reproof or rebuke remember he has just gotten back from blowing it in this chapter where he said to Abimelech that his wife was his sister you know that was not so good a god forgave him for that and there's no comments about that it's all very encouraging things about what God's plans are for his future so I told you that I had an appetite for the Word of God when the Spirit of God baptized me but also my prayer life started to I wanted to pray I wanted to talk to him I wanted to share with him it wasn't just during my prayer times it was all the time it was when I was in my car it was when I first woke up sometimes he'd wake me up in the middle of night I didn't always enjoy that but I enjoyed talking to him there was one time my car broke down I'll never forget I had this old jalopy of a car I was a poor student and it broke down right I remember right at Kramer and Chapman and it was like midnight and I lived out you know this best placenta I lived out in Europe when a few three or four miles away and I'll never forget I had just been studying the book of James which says there in", "James 1 you know count it all joy whenever you encounter various trials and one of the things we studied was you know the secret of overcoming trials and then go through them by faith is whenever you first encounter the trial that's really what the text says count enjoy considerate joy right when it starts forget it's too late so I I got out of the car and I went back to get my spare and I opened the trunk because I had a flat tire and I remember getting it out and I went oh no it was flat too I'm thinking wait a minute I remember James chapter 1 okay Lord I don't know what you're doing but you're doing something it's good I don't know that doesn't seem good because I have no way to get home and I remember I went over to the police department to use a payphone see that was a while ago and and I didn't have a dime all right this is even getting better and it was just like everything that was bad that could happened in that circumstance I needed to get home and get some sleep but here's what I sensed I said since God saying hey Bob hey Bob I want to spend some time with you and since you're gonna walk home these three or four miles anyway be with me cuz you would have been home in about five minutes driving your car wouldn't probably even talk to me so let's be together I literally felt like God was saying let's be together so you know what I did I jogged home and I worship forward the whole way on the side of the road as I'm just talking about talking it was the best flat tire I've ever had in my life it was awesome here's the thing when the Holy Spirit is on your life things that are bummers turn into blessings everything's changes when the Spirit of God gives you a different perspective and you start talking to the Lord and you realize he didn't have to let me have a flat tire he didn't have to lift a spare B flat he could have put it made sure I had a dime in my pocket there was somebody that would loan me one if if all those things happen that way there's a reason it's not like well that has nothing to do with God it has everything to do with God not because he's trying to just test my faith here you see what happens when this happens he no cuz I literally since he wanted some time with", "I definitely have 20 minutes half an hour jog home and I got home I was exhausting so I'm gonna drive me there the next day I couldn't care less I spent a half an hour at the king of the universe you meet God at the well and suddenly instead of doing devotions every morning or whenever you do them you start having devotional trade in your devotions for devotion and by the way it says he pitched a tent by the way you might remember he had stopped living in a tent in the previous two weeks ago when we studied and Guerard he was just living evidently in the house but he's back to living in a tent what is living in a tent represent in Scripture in the Old Testament huh I can't hear you a sojourner somebody who is not here permanently somebody who's a you know passing through for us we'd say it this way he's living by faith he's living by faith when you're filled with the Holy Spirit it's not about this life it's not about the things you can possess it's suddenly about heaven your permanent dwelling place is what the book of Hebrews says none of these Old Testament patriarchs had any permanent possessions because they didn't consider this about getting stuff here and so he's back living in a tent I love that and by the way look at the text one more time look at verse 25 right there he built an altar there he called on the name of the Lord he pitched his tent and there Isaac's servants dug a well that's gonna come back up in a moment but his servants dug a well you know when you live filled by led by empowered by the Holy Spirit the people around you are gonna see something in you they're digging Wells and I think that's interesting to me if you want your kids to be obedient if you want them to be respectful you can order them to be respectful say thank you say please do what I tell you to do because thus saith the grandpa try that see how that goes they may do it but inside there's no submission to you probably other than fear but you know what when you're filled with the Holy Spirit something changes where people see what's happening in life and they want what you have I love the fact that says the servants started digging a well and that's awesome they want the same experience the final principle is this our witness flows from this well we're gonna see his witness start in", "verse 26 and following then Abimelech came to him he's living at Bear Xie but he's in relationship with the Lord he's hearing from God he's living in his tent he's living by faith and this Gentile King comes to him verse 26 from Gerard and he's bringing some people with him an adviser named who's a--the and I know it looks like fight call but it's pronounced in Hebrew people the commander of his army so he's got a secretary of state you might say and his general verse 27 Isaac said to them why have you come to me since you hate me don't sugarcoat it tell him how you feel and you sent me away from you you told me to leave remember of course he's here forgets why he did that because he had lied to them caused a bunch of problems they said we see plainly the Lord has been with you these are non-believers we see plainly the Lord has been with you so we said let there now be an oath between us even between you and us let us make a covenant with you that you will do us no harm just as we have not touched you and I've done you nothing but good that wasn't exactly true and assents you away in peace you are now the blessed of the Lord then Isaac made a feast for them and they ate and drank and in the morning they arose early and exchanged oats then Isaac sent them away and they departed from him in peace now Isaac has freshly been kind of receiving revelation from the Lord and communication with the Lord but that was in private but he starts living by faith practically and we see it affects the way other people around him in his culture basically how they see him you know the Holy Spirit doesn't just produce his just produced changes within you to be a little secret intimacy with the Lord they said we see plainly the Lord is with you in other words when you're filled with the holy spirit it'll change you for sure but it'll change people's view of you as well it should how do people know that we're Christians how do they know is it because you know they know we go to church is it because of our bumper stickers you know oh they must be a Christian you know he is greater than I they don't know what that means by the way nobody knows it most Christians don't have a clue what that one means but it's really the secret things like the fish you know Christians", "are in the fishing no that's not the way people should know that we're Christians we start humming I am let's see I am a sea that's not yet either but the work of God on our life should affect us in such a way that other people know there's something different John Adama Isaiah 60 verses one through three a rise and shine for your light has come the Lord says and the glory of the lord has risen upon you for behold darkness will cover the earth deep darkness the people's but the Lord will rise upon you and his glory will appear upon you so here's the idea God illuminates us so others can be drawn to him kind of like a moth to a candle psalm 18 verses 28 and 29 david says this for you light my lamb talking the Lord God my god illumines my darkness for by you I can run upon a troop and by my god I can leap over a wall do you hear we're saying god you're the one who gives me a light that people can see and you give me abilities to do what otherwise I could not do do you remember what happened when the Spirit of God came on Saul before he was king somebody in here remembers that raise your hand if you can tell us what happened when the Holy Spirit came on Saul before he actually became King yeah he was found among the prophets and he was prophesying here's an here's a great verse John 1st samuel 10 in verse 6 this is Samuel predicting prophesying what's gonna happen to Saul when the Holy Spirit comes on him he says then the Spirit of the Lord will come upon you mightily and you shall prophesy which is what it was just said but notice this you will be chained into another man can I tell you something it's already believing in Jehovah here to believe in God it wasn't some kind of Gentile he believed he was raised with faith and Jehovah was circumcised he was a Jew if you want to become more like Jesus Christ if you want to become a different person as a believer the way that happens is the Holy Spirit coming upon you remember what Jesus said he said to his disciples stay in Jerusalem until you be endued with power from on high the Spirit of God will come upon you and you shall be my witnesses until they already had the message they'd had all the content of the gospel but they didn't have the power not just listen", "there's something a lot of people to understand witnessing isn't about just conveying information jesus said you shall be witnesses he didn't just say you will give information you will be evidence you will be witnesses that I'm alive you'll know that I'm alive but it's who you are it's the way you're living that's gonna be the witness this is why people don't understand it's not just about I have the boldness now to tell people they need to get saved no it's about your change life it's a you are an evidence a witness of the resurrection why because the resurrection power is alive in you and you're in love with somebody who you know is alive but other people have never met you are you will be my witnesses you see but it's when the Spirit of God is indwelling and coming upon each one of us and so these enemies of Isaac make a peace treaty with him proverbs 16 and verse 7 gives us the principle when a man's ways are pleasing to the Lord he makes even his enemies to be at peace with him now it's interesting when Jacob later in the book of Genesis is finally broken by the Lord remember he's crippled by the Lord and he's changed his name becomes Israel and he's literally he can't fight he saw he saw us coming before hundred men last time he he was around he said while he was running from he saw the last time because he said I'm gonna kill you and so he ran for his life he hasn't seen for years but he hears Esau is coming with a welcoming party of 400 men and he's terrified he wrestles with the Lord he's broken his name change he is now crippled or disabled he's he's literally leaning on his staff he can't fight he's not going to try because after he got changed after he got broken he's just gonna rely on the Lord of lords gonna take me I was gonna take him out very interesting God changes Esau his heart I have no doubt Esau originally when he heard he was coming intended to kill him but when he saw it gets dumb he just embraces him he just kisses him I miss you brother it's like really yeah I thought you wanted to kill me no I just miss you the Lord did that when your ways are pleasing to the Lord he can make even your enemies be at peace with you and that's exactly what happens in this text and so they come to him the king is general and they", "basically have said to each other we don't want to be on the wrong side of this guy we can see isn't an amazing when non-christians can see the Lord in someone's life we see the Lord has blessed you we see when we we want to be you know mainly because we would hate to have the Lord against us awesome you know Laban later we'll do that in Genesis 31 he'll make an oath with Jacob then he'll say I know that the Lord's blessed me because of you and then when Jacob leaves he makes an oath with Jacob and it's very similar kind of a thing there's these last couple of verses I want us to notice before we in the the study here verse 34 says this when Esau was forty years old so what kind of shifts gears from Isaac and just two verses on you saw when Esau was forty years old he married Judith the daughter the hittite and basemath the daughter of elon the hittite and they brought grief and Rebecca so we've already talked about how Isaac's a picture of a child of promise he is the one whom the Covenant will be with and he's the picture of Christ in the scripture and how he saw is not he saw is a type of a man of the flesh he goes after the things of the world but it's interesting Esau gets married but a couple things I want you to notice first of all he the first person he marries what's her name Judith guess what her name means her name means Jewess as in Jew a woman who's Jewish she's not a Jew though she's a Hittite it's very interesting her name really comes from the word Judah which will be one of the later names of one of the tribes but back here that she's not alive yet Judah means praise the Lord Francis you have a hittite a non follower of Jehovah who's naming his daughter a name that would have the appearance of someone of faith but it appears that that's all it is just a name just kind of the appearance of faith and so Esau is marrying a woman who has the kind of name that we would like to see but there's no evidence of faith in him or of her but he also then marries again which is also interesting now his dad is Isaac Isaac has one wife but how many did Grandpa have to Abraham and remember Sarah and Hagar it's very interesting Esau is kind of living after the flesh and making the same bad mistakes that", "his grandpa did when he failed in his marriage and he becomes not only a picture continuously of doing those things that dishonor the Lord with his marriage with his life but the last verse of the chapter these women brought literally bitterness to Isaac and to so you have on the one hand Isaac living by the well bringing blessing to everybody around him bringing you know with the Lord God speaking to him people want to be on his side and this the blessing of God but then you see in his children at least one of his sons bitterness coming his way let me say it this way listen you can be a nun fire spirit-filled Christian that is not guarantee you your children will be each child every one of our children have to make their own decisions about that you can model it in front of them it won't make them spirit-filled now it is the one of the best ways to help them want to be filled with the Holy Spirit and to obey the Lord is to again don't try to get your kids to be obedient teach them about the work of the Holy Spirit God's Spirit will teach them about obedience from the inside but I liked the fact that it says on the same day that he makes peace with his enemies that his Isaac's servants came to him and said we found the well what a blessing because he had wells taken away from him by the enemy he never punished them for it he never sued them for it you know when you allow yourself to be wronged without reacting justifying revenge you know one of the problems we have is when we're wrong we're most apt to do wrong when somebody hurts you and offends you we are so tempted but we feel so justified to get angry - yeah to punish back and I not do that they steal his Wells he says nothing he just moves on when we honor the Lord by letting go of things that people do to hurt us without taking offense and taking our own justice God will give it back to you on the same day that he's meeting with these people making friends letting it go what they've done wrong the Lord has a certain coming guess what we just dug a well we found water it's very cool what I see her it was a William temple the Archbishop of Canterbury who once said when I stopped praying the coincidences the coincidences stop happening when I stop and I feel like", "that's true when you're walking by the Holy Spirit God starts doing things and twice the phrases used on the same day or on the same night he went to bury but God appears it's like have you ever been waiting for God to do something for weeks or months or years and nothing seems to be happening it's like there are other times when when you're right with the Lord and suddenly things are happening left and right it's almost like wow it's just happening so fast around you and that's kind of what's happening in Isaac's life God starts revealing to him blessing him making promises to him and then this well is fact just as he's obeying Lord it's very very cool same day he forgives what they've taken away God gives it back to him and then kind of this this last principle and that is this I want to come back to this idea that he they had to dig a well it didn't work they dug a well it didn't work as it was the enemy frustrated it and then finally the third time around they dig a well and they find this flowing water you know I think there are many people who desire to be filled by the Holy Spirit but they're not desperate he said what do you mean by that the Holy Spirit doesn't fill people because of curiosity he fills people when it's a necessity in their life what did David say as the deer pants words only used one other time the Old Testament in Hebrew it means to cry out speaks of animals who are dying of thirst crying out to drink as the deer cries out of pants after the water Brooks so thirst my soul for the Oh God it's not enough to have a desire to be filled with the Holy Spirit I think we have to be desperate and we need to stay the course we need to ask and keep asking Jesus said wouldn't you ask don't remember when he talked about prayer this is true of everything about prayer he said that the problem is we asked him that we say uh-uh God didn't want to do it and he gave us an illustration remember the guy who has some friends come late at night he has no food to put before them so he says oh man next door it's late at night knocks on the door hey I need some food I didn't get the stater brothers and I'm I haven't been Barristan and what does a guy say go away we're all in bed", "sleeping tell you showed up come to the door go away and Jesus said the man will not get up because he's your friend and help you but he will go get up and help you because of you won't stop knocking Jesus said don't give up keep asking ask and keep asking and it'll be given to you may I encourage you if you want a fresh work of the Holy Spirit don't give up keep digging there's still more let's pray father I pray for those that are dry those that are discouraged I pray for those that feel like they have been witnessed for you lately or maybe ever I pray for those who feel like sin has crept back into their life and taking them captive again Lord or that their fleshly desires are so much stronger than their spiritual desires I pray for those who struggle with praying even when they've set time aside and those who read the word and they feel like they get nothing out of it lord I thank you that you have made all of us capable in fact you've made all of us designed for eternity to be spiritual beings who bring you glory the Lord every one of us needs the same work we need to surrender our lives that you might control and consume and fill us afresh so I pray for an outpouring of your Holy Spirit on me on our church the body of Christ in Southern California I pray you would bring revival to us and you'd restore to us as you did in the days of old a fresh work in Jesus name god bless you guys", "Lord we want to praise you above it all there's many things that are but they all point to you and we tend to give our praise to things that are not praiseworthy and sometimes lead us away from you and so we pray that we would use this time to uh Who You Are for what you've done or that we would lay down our crowns our we would lay down when we cast our cares on you know that we would hold nothing back in our adoration and attempt to honor your name tonight pray he's all in Jesus name amen he was ready to Worship the Lord of hosts the Lord of lords King of Kings it was like this huge build up and we're just gonna crash in on you and uh something went wrong in the back so here's what we're gonna do find somebody they have not met shake their hand tell them you're happy to see him in church and then we'll we'll do that living in Freedom shaking my bird is away you only for you for the cross this is the reason I see I will not be silent so good we're so good we're so good to this is the reason I sing for the hope that you give the joy that you bring for like a

that Moses and Casey have with music and worship but also do some kind of Outreach into the community so pray for Sligo pray for Casey and Moses their health and that God would give us opportunity uh to share the gospel there's a VBS that'll be going on for part of the time they're there with a bunch of kids from the neighborhood and", "then our prayers to invite parents out back to the church so that they might hear the gospel so we'd really appreciate your your prayer like you to open your Bibles to the Book of Numbers as we continue our study through the Old Testament numbers 23 and tonight we're going to start in verse 27 and hopefully get into chapter 24 as well if you didn't get an outline to go get those even now and if you're online and you don't have one go to our church app and you can go on the the live broadcast and there's an outline you can fill in if you want to electronically but numbers 23 verse 27. now remember King balak has already twice asked and tried to hire Balaam to curse God's people Israel as they're going through the Wilderness near where he is and twice he's opened his mouth to curse and each time what blessing has come out of his mouth because he said I can only speak what God gives me and what God wants to bless his people so since the enemy wants to God's people God wants to bless him he turns the curse into a blessing verse 27 then balak said to Balaam please come I will take you to another place perhaps it will be agreeable with God that you curse them from me from there so balak took Balaam to the top of pior which overlooks the desert or the Wilderness the Wasteland and Balaam said to balak build seven altars for me here prepare seven bowls and seven Rams for me here and balak did just as Balaam had said and offered up a bull and a ram on each altar so they go through this worship and then verse 1 of chapter 24. when Balaam saw that it pleased the lord to bless Israel he did not go as at other times to seek Omens but he set his face toward the Wilderness and Balaam lifted up his eyes and he saw Israel camping tribe by tribe and the spirit of God came on him he took up his discourse and he said the word Oracle in the Hebrew means the burden or the word the Oracle of Balaam the son of bior and the Oracle of the man whose eye is open the Oracle of him who hears the words of God who sees the vision of the almighty falling down yet having his eyes uncovered how fair are your tents o Jacob your dwellings o Israel like valleys that stretch out like Gardens beside the river like aloes planted by the Lord like Cedars beside", "the waters water will flow from Israel's buckets and his seed will be by many Waters and his King shall be higher than agag and his kingdom shall be exalted God brings him out of Egypt he the Lord is for Israel like the horns of the wild ox he will devour the Nations who are his adversaries and will crush their bones and pieces and shatter them with his arrows he Israel couches he lies down as a lion and as a lion Who Dares Rouse him blessed is everyone who blesses you and cursed is everyone who curses you let's pray father how we want to not only see your heart for your People Israel as imperfect and and really unbelieving many times as they were Lord over and over and over again failing you and yet your plans for them have not changed your promises to them are completely unchangeable and the the gifts and the calling of God are are irrevocable and I thank you your faithfulness to Israel reminds us that we can trust you with your promises to us that you who began a good work in us will complete it to the day of Jesus Christ so help us to see you and and the blessings that are really upon not just Israel but your people in the church in Jesus name we pray amen you can be seated well as we're going through this we're plans to try to bring a curse on God's people and we're discovering that's exactly true the enemy wants to stop the work of God in your life God plans to bless you the enemy wants to thwart that if he can and to keep that blessing from you and so all through these chapters we're reading how each time Balaam opens his mouth we hear even though he's really a false prophet but the things that he says are true they're inspired and they're in the Bible so we can study them as the word of God although it comes through a very interesting and odd vehicle this Balaam guy who's clearly not a true surrendered soul but nonetheless his words are worth studying otherwise God wouldn't have included him in the word put this down the enemy seeks a good angle to hurt us the enemy seeks a good angle and you notice here in the text back in the chapter 23 verse 27 let's go back balak says to Balaam come and I will take you to another place we've tried to other places it didn't work let's get another place perhaps it will be pleasing to God", "that you can curse for me from there in the Book of Job we've mentioned this before when the devil Satan is really in the presence of God and God is asking him where he's been he says well I've been going to and fro the Earth walking around you know and God says well have you noticed my servant job and and he starts bragging about you know job don't you love the fact that the Lord brags about you to to the edge of you man if you notice that I've never had a really good day now but he's bragging about Joe being a godly man who who walks away from Evil and remember the devil says well the reason he does that is because you know you blessed him so much that's how the Book of Job begins but it's interesting the word that God uses when he's talking to the devil in Job 1 8 have you considered it's translated in The New American Standard have you considered my servant job it's an interesting word it's a word that is used actually the Old Testament at one time to speak of a of like a general who's trying to figure out how to attack an enemy picture Joshua and Jericho how are we going to get in there high walls there's no way what's the best what's the weakest point you know strategizing and that's the word god uses have you looked at my servant job for a way to get at him and of course he's going to tell them yes stop the blessings touch his flesh remember and and I'll be able to get him to curse you very interesting that is what the enemy does the enemy is looking for an angle whereby he can attack you and me that's always the case he studies you for vulnerabilities to take away your blessings now we know the devil is an opportunist we're told that after Jesus was baptized that he went out into the Wilderness driven by the Holy Spirit really to be tested of the devil and he was 40 days and 40 nights without eating he and then it says he became hungry you know for most of us it had been about 40 minutes but Jesus was 40 days your hunger goes away and after the hunger comes back you're actually starting to starve and it says when Jesus became then the devil said if you are the Son of God turn these stones into bread he's looking for that opportunity in Luke 4 13 actually then describes the end of The Temptations with these words and", "when the devil had finished every Temptation he departed from him and tell say it out loud opportune time yeah he's waiting for that moment where he condemned him yet again and that's really the way it is you know for most of us the greatest Temptations aren't going to come when you're in a church service now you can be tempted anywhere but I mean it's usually not the hardest thing you're going to do today and I mean unless I just go too long and sorry I'm running a hard time staying awake but Temptations aren't so bad here you know when we're worshiping the Lord and with other Christians but Satan looks for those opportune times in your life I you know as a police officer um I would take crime reports all the time and on the standard police report one of the boxes you have to fill in is called the mo the mo the method of operation how did this crime happen you know and so if a burglar is breaking into homes by taking the rear sliding door off of the tracks with a crowbar and we start to see that same method used in different places good chance same guy or same people and so that those are all those go into the statistics because what criminals do just like anybody they're pragmatic they do what works they find something that works and they keep doing it well guess what that's exactly what Satan does jotted down Ephesians 6 and verse 11. Paul says put on the full armor of God that you may be able to stand against the schemes of the devil you know what that word schemes is in Greek it's he's got methods and his methods are different for each one of us I don't know what your Achilles heel is your weakness is it about money then he'll keep using it until you resist and firm in your faith and he'll leave you but if you if is it fear can he can he freak you out that he'll keep doing that oh why there's somebody in the house and you know it's it's a ghost and whatever he'll if you he'll do he'll do whatever you want him to do his sexual temptation is it is it is it food is it is it pleasure is it possessions is it pride it God whatever it is he'll keep doing it if you are weak in that area because he knows that he can get a put this down letter B see where and when God's blessing comes where and when", "in chapter 24 put this down the blessing comes when we see God's people together it's very interesting putting the word together first four verses of chapter 24 when Balaam saw it please the lord to bless Israel well he doesn't go looking for the Omens from the from the enemy but he set his face toward the Wilderness and Balaam lifted up his eyes notice this he saw Israel camping of course they're camping that's how they're for 40 years but they're they're tenting tribe by tribe and then the spirit of God came upon and by the way you'll find again and again in scripture when people speak under the inspiration of the Holy Spirits when the spirit of God comes upon them very interesting Saul who was going to be declared the king of Israel the first king later on in the Bible is going to prophesy uh Samuel tells him when the spirit of God comes on him he sees a group of prophets who are prophesying the spirit of God comes on him same thing happens with the seventy the spirit of God that's been on Moses comes on the 70 and they prophesy the to prophesy simply means to speak forth that which God is wanting you to say there are times in your life and you don't have to be a Prophet by the way to prophesy I know that sounds confusing a prophet is an office prophesying is a gift and anybody can prophesy who's a if God chooses to use you by the way that is one of the attributes of the New Covenant the old Covenant certain people the spirit of God came on them they were anointed prophets priests and kings were anointed to be used by God in Authority but the New Covenant unlike the old Covenant the spirit of God is Not exclusive to certain people in certain offices but rather if you read in Acts chapter 2 Peter says what happened on the day of Pentecost he said this is that which was spoken by Joel the prophet he quotes Joel too in the last days God says I will pour out my spirit upon All Flesh new young men shall see Visions your old men shall dream dreams even upon your maidservants they'll all prophesy they'll speak forth the word of God that doesn't matter how much Bible you know or or what position you have or who God's spirit can come upon any believer because the spirit of God is in you and when he comes upon you he can use your mouth and the story of Balaam we've", "already read how God can use a donkey to speak his word and he's using another one by the way named Balaam and that's kind of about what this story is about God can use anybody if we get that from any story in the Bible it's the story of Balaam because his donkey spoken so did a guy who clearly isn't even a True Believer but God decides to use his mouth but the blessing notice here of God comes the context is when God's people are together and I think that's really important to recognize this so Balaam sees Israel this time not just a part of them in these other two times he would see them just a few of them this time he sees all of them in their totality he gets a whole different View and a kind of a drone view from up on um now it's true when we look just at a part of God's people we can easily be tempted to curse rather than bless we can say man I don't like that part of God's people and that's the you know that's the part that you must be the you know soon to be removed and of little value and and you know that we can get this wrong picture of of God's people but when we see God's people accurately when we see God's people through his eyes completely different jot it down Revelation 21 verses 9 through 11. one of the Seven Angels who had the seven bowls full of the seven last plagues came and spoke with John the Beloved who wrote this saying come here and I will show you the bride the wife of the lamb and he carried me away in the spirit to a great and high mountain and he showed me the Holy City Jerusalem coming down out of Heaven from God having the glory of God her Brilliance was like a very costly Stone as a stone of crystal clear jasper and so yes he's seeing the New Jerusalem but the New Jerusalem is also the bride of Christ it's like well which is it is it a city or is it the the bride yep and it's interesting how God sees his people so differently he sees her as a beautiful precious stone what did Jesus say the Kingdom of Heaven is like a merchant seeking fine pearls and upon finding one of Great Value that Merchant went and sold all that he had that he might gain the Pearl when God sees his church he doesn't say look she's a dirt clod oh no she's a precious", "precious gem now it's interesting in verse two he sees them according to their tribes in their god-ordained place when they took their place in right relationship to each other this is going to be the place of blessing and it still is you want to see God's blessing on your life then take your place in right relationship with God's people jot it down psalm 133. Psalm 133 is one of the shortest Psalms it's only three verses so we'll read the behold how good and how pleasant it is for brothers to dwell together in unity it's like the precious oil upon the head coming down upon the beard even Aaron's beard he was the high priest anointed coming down upon the edge of his robes it's like the Dew of Mount hormone the highest mountain in Israel coming down upon the mountains of Zion for notice this there it's not just Mount Hermon there God's people gathered together in unity the Lord commanded the blessing life forever that's where God's blessing is to be seen where it is going to be communicated to us that's where other people are going to see it as well jot down Psalm 46 Verses 4 and 5. God is in the midst of her she will not be moved he's talking about his people uh Zion Jerusalem God is in the midst of her she will not be moved God will help her when mourning Dawns this is why the blessing of God is with his people when they're together not just because we're just such cool people having a good time with each other because Jesus said where two or more gathered what yeah it's Israel with the presence of God you see he's he's leading them in the pillar of cloud by dead the pillar of fire about it when God is in her midst she's blessed you see we never look as good to anybody as we do when we're with him but the closer I get to him the better I look the better I am the more attractive you are when we're close to the Lord that's when we begin like Moses to actually reflect his glory and so that's where the blessing God is ordained it's with his people put this down the blessing comes right where God has placed us in verse 5 how fair are your tents o you're dwelling o Israel it's interesting because I don't know that Israel felt blessed this day they aren't there uh listening to this we're listening to something that was said and none of Israel was there can I tell you something you are blessed", "if you're a God's child whether you can see it or not you are blessed Psalm 144 verse 15. how blessed are the people who are so situated how blessed are the people whose God is the lord well let me just ask this is God your lord is your god Jehovah then you are blessed you will always feel blessed I yeah just when I sneeze and someone says God bless you then I kind of think here's what the Bible says if you are in Christ you already have every spiritual blessing there is that's Ephesians 1 3 every spiritual blessing there's nothing else outside that you are still waiting for you have it already in Christ you need to see the big picture of where you are now Colossians 3 first three verses listen to what Paul writes there if then since then is what the Greek means if then you have been raised up with Christ well then keep seeking the things above where Christ is seated at the right hand of God set your mind on the things above not on the things that are on the earth for you have died and your life is hidden with Christ in God you know we need to see ourselves the way the Lord sees us because we don't often Paul says don't forget you've already died in your risen and you're already in at the right hand of God as far as God is concerned you're already glorified in the Lord's mind because of what Jesus Christ has done for you that's why when somebody comes in and they just look like they've been through terrible times you know I say how are you doing they'll say things like well you know okay under the circumstances and my question is what are you doing under those you're not supposed to be under the circumstances you're at the right hand of the father far you can be far above it but you have to see where you are put this down literacy see the blessing of how God sees you how God sees you in verse 6 like valleys that stretch out like Gardens beside the river like aloes planted by the Lord like Cedars beside the waters these are all metaphors to describe God's people put this down you are blessed full of full of life fragrant of Life fragrant and valleys are the place mentioned time and time again in the Bible as the place of God's blessings second chronicles 20 verses 26 and 27 for those that are taking every note you on the fourth day they gathered in the", "valley of blessing which got its name that day because the people praised and thanked the Lord there it is still called the valley of blessing today then all the men returned to Jerusalem with Jehoshaphat leading them jot down the Song of Solomon 6 verse 11 or canticles if you like to call it that song song with Solomon 6 11. I went down oops I went down into the garden of nuts to see the fruits of the valley that's where the it's fruitful and to see whether the vine flourished and the I'm not sure what's so funny but uh I'm glad you're enjoying it yes okay yes God is interested in spiritual fruit not religious nuts but that's where the the valleys are again and again the valley of baka place of God's blessing even the hardest times we go through can become times of great blessing though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death there are other things that happen in valleys though I walk but you're walking through it and I don't have any fear why because he's with me so you know yes valleys can be dark at times but there are great blessings to be discovered and then he describes them as a garden a garden beside the river that of course reminds us of the blessings of Eden where God created Paradise The Song of Solomon chapter 4 verse 12. a garden locked is my sister my bride a rock garden locked a spring sealed up very interesting that the bride is pictured as this beautiful garden and then it speaks of aloes now this speaks of that fragrant Spar spice that is associated in the Bible with the bride specifically jot down the Song of Solomon Chapter 4 verses 13 and your shoots are an orchard of pomegranates this is the bridegroom talking to the bride with Choice fruits henna with nard plans nard and saffron calamus and cinnamon with all the trees of frankincense and myrrh and aloes along with all the finest spices now what you want to see here is God is picturing Israel as the bride of Christ as the bride from The Song of Solomon beautiful a pleasant place to be Psalm 45 verses 1 and 2. my heart is indicting a good matter I speak of the things which I have made touching the king my tongue is the PIN of a ready writer then listen to this Thou Art fairer than the children of men he's talking now to the King this is talking actually to Messiah Grace is poured upon thy lips therefore God has blessed thee forever", "so we see that this is a picture of the bridegroom but then it's interesting to me in the New Testament we have this picture of this fragrant Aroma poured on Jesus Remember Mary who came during that 12 and verse 3 John 12 and verse 3 talks about what happened she came and Mary therefore took a pound of very costly perfume of pure nard anointed the feet of Jesus and wiped his feet with her hair now if you remember that story Jesus is invited to dinner and Mary who was considered an unclean woman comes in and takes us very expensive nard this very precious ointment and she breaks it open and she pours it on Jesus's feet and then the disciples started saying man that should have been sold to give it to the poor that's a waste what she did and you know she's down at Jesus's feet weeping and the Bible says that she pours it on his feet but then she uses her hair to wipe it off it's very interesting and then it says and it the smell filled the house it's very interesting to me and Jesus of course defends her you know he says she's anointed me for my funeral it's a good thing this story will be told everywhere so whenever the gospel is told we talk about about the about Mary because he was honored by her but it's very interesting to me the precious ointment is on the feet of Jesus and on one other person in the house on Mary who humbles herself because she's forgiven remember he said the one who loves much has been forgiven much and it fills the entire house this is the picture really I believe of the Lord's fragrance he's beautiful in every regard he's he smells good every day but that woman even that unclean woman who had a past because she humbles herself and accepts his love and forgiveness she winds up with the exact same fragrance that he has I think that's an amazing passage jot Down's second uh Corinthians 2 verses 14 and 15 but thanks be to God Paul says who always leads us in his Triumph in Christ and he manifests through us the sweet Aroma of the knowledge of him in every place for we Christians are a fragrance of Christ to God Among those who are being saved and among those who are perishing beautiful picture of the bride having this fragrance really of the Lord and then we read there in verse six like Cedars beside the waters and of course if you read Psalm 1 you know this story", "how blessed is the man or the woman of God who meditates in God's law day and night they'll be like what a tree planted by rivers of Living Water who bring forth their fruit and their season their Leaf dust and withering whatever they do they they Prosper so number two under letter c see yourself as a source of spiritual blessing to others there in verse 7 water will flow from his buckets now in John 7 and verse 37 there Jesus on the last day the great day of the stood up and he cried out saying if anyone is thirsty let him come to me and drink and out of his innermost being shall flow rivers of Living Water now most of us have heard that and we think oh that's the ministry of the Holy Spirit and it is but if you'll realize he's not just saying you're going to get the Holy Spirit he's saying as a Christian you're going to be the source of the holy spirit in other people's lives right if anyone is I'm coming to me and drink if you drink believe on the Lord which is what it's talking about you put your faith in him he'll pour the Holy Spirit into you so the spirit of God might come from you we used to sing a song I've got a River of Life flowing out of me not just and so this picture of these buckets of water coming through and the idea is just diminishing to other people and then it says there in verse seven his seed will be by many Waters the seed in the New Testament and the Old Testament at times refers to God's the Seed of Abraham but it also is a reference to the word of God we know in the parable of the sower Jesus said the seed is the word of God and we've been born again according to the word of God so it's very interesting to me that it speaks of many Waters because that reference of many Waters is used in The Book of Revelation to describe the way Jesus sounds when he talks Revelation 1 and verse 15. Revelation 1 he sees this vision of the glorified Christ and Christ's feet were like burnished bronze when it has been caused to Glow in a furnace and his voice was like the sound of now you might say what does that mean well we're not told John doesn't describe it but I've heard someone say this and I like it it's not just how you know if you've been to Niagara Falls you", "know what that sounds like or a river I mean that's it's a wonderful sound it's gentle and but many Waters someone has said it's kind of like this when God wants to speak to you many times he will take if you will different sources picture a river and a river and a stream coming together all in one place and of course you can hear the waters that when the Lord wants to say something to you might read something in your quiet time in the morning and say well I wonder what if I if I need to do something with that verse and then you're on your way to work and you listen to the Christian radio and the guy's preaching on that verse you ever had that happen and you're talking to a friend they go guess what my devotional was about let me guess same verse or you go to church and somebody it's like Lord are you trying to get my attention through many channels God is bringing to you one message he has a way to get his message across and I love that picture I think that's certainly true of Our Lives put this down our King is king of King things and his kingdom will be exalted in verse 7 again it says of Israel's King his King shall be higher than a gag well I hope so and his kingdom shall be exalted now this is an interesting verse Israel doesn't have a king right now I they're not gonna have a king for a while they're not even in the promised land yet we're gonna have judges first you know we go through it you don't have Kings they'll book a Samuel first king is Saul and and David is about a thousand BC and the exit has happened in the 15th century BC we're talking hundreds of years so they have a king so it's very interesting to me we're gonna find here in balaam's Prophecy that he's going to talk about things that are futuristic he has no idea what he's talking about but he's describing things that we can look back and see that's exactly right because Israel's King the ultimate king that's going to be higher than than a gag of course is the Lord Jesus jotted down Revelation 19 and verse 16. and on his robe Christ's robe and on his thigh he has a name written yeah you got to hear Handel's Messiah right king of kings and Lord of lords in Revelation 11 and verse 5 also in the and the seventh angel sounded and there", "are those loud voices in heaven saying the kingdom of the world has become the kingdom of our Lord and of his Christ and he will reign forever and ever and amen Daniel 2 and verse 35 and that of the future kingdoms of the Earth we read this concerning the interpretation that Daniel gave them the iron the clay the bronze the silver and the gold were crushed this image of that the king had seen all at the same time and became like shaft from the summer threshing floors and the wind carried them away so that not a trace of them was found but the stone that he had seen in his in his vision the stone that struck the statue became a great mountain or a kingdom which is what mountains represent in Prophecy a great Mountain that filled the whole earth and then finally Daniel 7 and then this sovereignty the Dominion and the greatness of all the kingdoms under the whole of heaven will be given to the people of the Saints of the highest one his kingdom will be an everlasting Kingdom and all the dominions will serve and Obey him that's what the Old Testament teaches that's what the Book of Revelation teaches that's what's going to happen when Jesus comes back all nations will be submitted to him man I can't wait for that day aren't you excited that you're going to be there aren't you grateful you know while it says every knee will bow in every tongue I can't wait till every knee bows but I'm sure grateful I'm not waiting for my knees to Bow till then you do not want to wait for that to be when it happens but you want to be doing that now put this down number four God set us free and we know God is for us these are part of the blessings of God God set us free God brings Israel out of Egypt well for 400 years they were there and they were born slaves they live their entire lives in slavery until God set him free and by the way so did you so did I until we met Christ we were born in sin we were born enslaved to our sin according to scripture then according to Romans 6 we're no longer slaves to sin or slaves to fear like we sing but God set is free and we know that God is for us notice it when it says God brings him out of Egypt for him like the horns of the wild ox what does that talk about the horns of", "an animal speak of their strength God has not just brought us out of a time of slavery that we've known our whole life like the Israelites but also now he is completely uh he's on our side he's forced but he's changed our lives around do you remember when we used to have I don't know it's been years now uh what we called the cardboard testimonies how many of you have ever seen a cardboard Testament a lot of you haven't seen that well we've done it with our youth we've done it with people in the church where people will come up on stage and hold up a cardboard that said kind of what they used to be in a phrase in a word you know and uh sometimes it was pretty radical stuff I remember we had um one guy he came up and he said drug dealer and then he turned it around his youth pastor that's because he used to be one of the biggest drug dealers here in in this area and he you know became not only a youth pastor he was an assistant pastor for me and then was going to be a missionary and now then the Lord called him to heaven and an amazing man Mike Swanson but these sometimes we don't know much about each other's past and we don't go bragging and talking about it we shouldn't be because we're not really to glorify it and a lot of us aren't proud of our past but we're proud of our savior who saved us from the past because we're different we're not who we used to be I remember a guy on the radio called up a Christian radio station and they were saying well what are you thankful for and he said well I used to be a hopeless drug addict and now I'm a drugless hope addict you know and I I pray that you have a testimony you know what you are is not what you were praise God are enemies who are much too powerful for us are absolutely no match for him in the text look what it says it says he will devour the Nations who are his adversaries and will crush their bones in pieces and shatter them with his arrows this is what Israel is going to do to her enemies and then verse 9 he couches he lies down as a lion now we know that Jesus is the real lion king according to scripture the lion of the tribe of Judah who crushed the Serpent's head when he died on the cross but it's", "interesting it's describing this victory of Israel and really it's a picture of the messiah's victory he I think the Messiah couches he lies down as a lion and as a lion Who Dares Rouse him blessed is everyone who blesses you now now jot down Genesis 49 verses 9 and 10. this is a prophecy of Jacob concerning his sons for the future and he mentions the tribe of Judah long before there was a king Judah is a Lion's welp from the prey my son you have gone up he couches he lies down as a lion and as a lion Who Dares rise him up sound familiar listen Bala had not read the book of Genesis just so you know because the author was out with God's people okay that he was looking at from a distance but he seems to know the very description that will be written in the Book of Genesis about the future it's fast how could he possibly know the exact same description of the Messiah he's getting it from the same Source you see I love that same author I've told you before I think I shared recently sometimes people will come to me and ask me how I know something it's like I I didn't know that but God did God knows what you're doing I've had people come and say you know you were looking at me and I haven't been tithing lately and that's why you're looking at me I said I know it now but I said I don't I don't know how anybody gives I never I I have never known the church is almost 40 years old I've never once known who what gives that's that's none of my business that's between you and the Lord I guess you want me to know that you're not giving okay but they think I'm looking at them where no you're feeling condemned yourself or something but God knows and if he's putting his finger on something in your life well I'm taking up with the one who knows you put this down the way they determines how God treats them I want you to put that in what it decides or determines and and again look at verse 9 blessed is everyone who blesses you and cursed is everyone who curses you now this goes back to the blessing upon Abraham where God said to him I will bless those who bless you and I will curse those who curse you fascinating to me this is still true those who speak a blessing not just of Israel that's why I think it's so important for the United", "States frankly to bless Israel to see them as a unique people of God that doesn't mean that everything they always do is right but we need to be a blessing to them when we need to pronounce blessing upon them in part our nation whether you know it or not has been blessed because of its historical attitude toward Israel did you know that study our history in relationship to Israel and you will find that God has blessed us as a result but it's fascinating if they bless my people I will bless them so the way they treat God's people you and me today determines how God treats them remember that thing we used to say when we were kids I am rubber you are glute I don't know how many of you said that when somebody starts calling you names how many of you ever have heard that some of you are lying you remember it I am somebody calls you named I am rubber you are glue everything you say bounces off of me and sticks to you or whatever right or some of us we got tired of saying that we just hold up our hand they'd start saying mean things why are you doing this like what's going on keep going and uh or I know you are but what am I you remember that one well that's basically What's Happening Here God says when they when when you know when somebody blesses you they'll get blessed but if they curse you they're just cursing themselves when they put you down God says I'm I will what is what does God say to the Lord Jesus say to Saul who is out to kill and arrest Christians Saul Saul why are you persecuting the church no why are you persecuting me I take it very personally the way you treat my bride step outside I mean don't bother stop being outside step off the donkey under your face I mean basically the Lord's gonna deal with those people who are put this down uh letter D know how God can use you to speak for him how God could use you to speak for him I I I'll bet there's a bunch of people in this room who feel like God has never used you to actually speak for him or if he did you didn't know it now it's possible for God to use you and you don't know he's using you but it's also possible for God to use you and you do know it and it's possible for you to say I not", "only no he does and he can but I want him to that's the desire by the way in the book of First Corinthians the church at Corinth was carnal they were fleshly they were immature there were problems all kinds of problems in that church but they were into certain spiritual gifts like they really enjoyed speaking in tongues that was one of their main things you know so they'd get together and have a tongue Fest and nobody could understand anything but it was really cool just I've got using my mouth and so Paul's having to write them saying you know what I speak in tongues more than any of you but I do it in private I don't do it when I'm in a group meeting so everybody thinks you know everybody there is nuts he goes That's not proof you're spiritual at all you're just doing that to edify yourself so he's he's speaking correction but it's interesting what he says you ought to pray that you can because when you prophesy God is speaking through you and he can encourage and edify the body of Christ and people understand it he said that's really the gift you should be asking so I wonder if you've ever prayed God I would love to prophesy that made me feel like that's weird I don't know like the saith the Lord I mean no you don't have to you don't have to use King James language and be weird about it and you might even find and realize wow I need to be sensitive to the spirit of God because the fact is he's going to use your mind your mouth your vocal cords and your language to speak his word um I mean he yes he made a donkey talk that was miraculous but when balaam's talking here balaam's not using some other voice you know his big boy prophecy voice he's just talking but the content was from the Lord and the effect is from the Lord so God wants to use your heart your mind but he wants it to be his message and his anointing is always on his word you know here's what the Bible says in Hebrews 4 12. the word of God is alive and Powerful it's sharper than any two-edged sword and it pierces to the division of Soul and Spirit joint and Marrow and it's able to judge the thoughts and the intentions of the heart God's word has the ability to get to the core issues of what's going on inside people's lives you know you can sit down and counsel somebody with the wisdom you've studied", "psychology and you've got your doctorate your marriage and family counselor you can use all the wisdom of man and you might be able to encourage somebody but you do not because of that have the power of God listen the most important words I'll ever speak in my life are not my own they're not words that I have figured out work instead you know it's not and the most important words I'll ever speak are actually these words you know why I know that because these words in this book are eternal my words are not I learned a long time ago I have three sons they're all grown up now but when they were little I learned there's no power in thus saith the dad for a while there is but then that wears but there is eternal power in thus saith when you share God's word and when God's spirit takes God's word and it comes out of your mouth there's nothing more powerful on this planet and that's why we need to say Lord I want you to use me I want you to speak through me put this down if you want God to speak to you let God speak his Blessing through you and we ought to probably recognize that when Balaam speaks for God it's a so if you're going to be speaking for God you might want to consider that's likely to be what God speaks and I say that to you I'll tell you why every once in a while I have the experience of somebody coming up to me they usually don't attend the church except that particular night they probably won't be coming back actually um I can tell by how they feel about me and so they they will come up to me and say I have a word for you I think okay here it comes God spoke to me told me to tell you that you're in basically they just start telling me something they didn't like about my message because they don't like my personality that's fine I don't really mind if they don't like maybe they don't they shouldn't be at this church because they need somebody who's who's different that's fine but when criticizing me putting me down and they think that that the Lord has sent them I kind of know right away he didn't he said well how do you know that well that's because of what the Bible says jotted down first Corinthians 14 and verse 3. but one who prophesies speaks to men for now before you go well maybe they're exhorting you that's not what that word", "means exhortation is not you shouldn't have been doing that that's not exhortation biblically at all edification means to build up exhortation means you're going in the right direction keep going or for comfort and when somebody comes up and criticizes me I say well check check yeah I'm sorry I didn't qualify as First Corinthians 14 3 and the last time I checked no offense to you but I think God still has my address and the last time I know he when I ask him to which is all the time he does speak to me so I'm not saying he's not speaking to you I'm saying I'm not receiving it as the word from God from you so when somebody comes to put you down in the name of Jesus be careful that they haven't been set by another because there are people who are convinced they're speaking for God and they want to be your personal spiritual travel agent and send you on guilt trips saying not interested in going anywhere balak is ticked off and he basically is going to say this isn't what I hired you to do I hired you to curse and not bless them but the fact when God speaks through people people so you might want to ask yourself the question gee did somebody get blessed then that was probably the Lord I like what Chuck Smith said once and I love Chuck Smith he's one of my favorite teachers I know it's not everybody's you know some people need to repent but he was an amazing Bible teacher yes he would go along so I try to follow in his joking but not joking the fact is Chuck said this once and I'll never forget it in a service I was at he said you know if you ever because he was talking to his congregation he said if and God just blesses you that was the Lord he goes if it's boring how is Chuck and so you know you kind of know when it's Lord when it's not but the fact is when if if somebody's getting blessed as you Minister your heart toward them there's a good chance God's using you give credit over don't go that was pretty good I mean was it no that's the Lord using you don't take credit all gifts come down from the Father of Lights he's using you thank him for that God you use the donkey's mouth again put this down number two speak God's word without changing 10 and 11 are final two verses uh I think we're going to get through 13", "maybe we'll get through 13. then balak's anger burned against Balaam he struck his hands together and balak said to Balaam I called you to curse my enemies behold you've persisted in blessing them these three times you think three strikes and you're out and there's one more major Blessing about the future in the next section we won't get there tonight but we will in the future therefore verse 11 flee to your place go home I said I would honor you greatly but behold the Lord has held you back from honor oh yeah boy that's a weird perverted way of thinking about it Balaam said to balak did I not tell your Messengers whom you sent to me saying though balak were to give me his whole house full of silver and gold I could not do anything contrary to the command of the Lord either good or bad of my own accord what the Lord speaks that I will speak basically what Balaam says to angry balak is you need you need to check the fine print of our contract go back and read it again what I said was you owe me a house full of your house full of silver and gold that was but I also can't change what God gives me to say hmm remember we find this again and again in scripture Old Testament Deuteronomy also in the Book of Revelation don't add to what God has said and don't subtract from it don't change it at all and if you are willing to give God's word out in its Purity or give God's word out as it comes through you God will speak through you by the way if you haven't known it before in the New Testament the enemies of Jesus are two big groups the Pharisees and the we tend to just kind of lump them in as you know bad Hypocrites and and that they they probably were all buddies and they just were different groups oh no they didn't sing Kumbaya and hang out together ever these are enemies of each other who is just a lot like our Congress okay there were two parties and the Sanhedrin was made up of both of Sadducees ruled the temple they're the Priestly group the Pharisees had the respect of the people because they were the Bible Thumpers who appeared to be living it out and nobody was as righteous as those guys at least that's what they told them and they appeared to be the most righteous people on the planet of course they were self-righteous but it's very interesting when you think about this issue of", "adding or subtracting to the word of God because that's exactly what each of them fell into the problem of the Pharisees added to what God Said the tradition of the elders they taught the Bible plus these things that we've always done you must do what we say wash your hands don't work on the Sabbath don't heal on the Sabbath because that's what we say yeah God says this he said don't work on the Sabbath let me tell you what he meant we've got books written about what he meant they've added to what God Said and they were very legalistic they were critical of people they were well they weren't fair you see you know that's the problem with them and then the Sadducees on the other hand the opposite they didn't add to the word of God they subtracted from the word of God they by the way only accepted the parts of the Bible their whole Bible was the Old Testament for the Pharisees but not for see I just only accepted what part of the Old Testament tentative the writings of Moses if Moses didn't write it if it ain't Moe it's got to go not going to accept anything else don't accept those prophets and all those other people and no no no Psalms and Dave nope just inspired what Moses wrote and so they came to the conclusion There Are Not Angels there are not demons there is no there are no Miracles there's no afterlife as far as we're concerned it's just the moral teachings by the way that's why Jesus quotes Moses to con to let them know they're wrong about afterlife he uses the scriptures that they did accept remember God introduced himself in Exodus 3 14 to Moses saying I am the god of Abraham Isaac and Jacob that's right from there when they accepted and he said he didn't say I was God's not the god of the Dead He's the god of the living they didn't like that because he was disproving their own views but they they threw out Miracles and afterlife in heaven that's why they were sad you see and so they but the bottom line is if you add or subtract to the word of God you will pervert the word of God and so if you want God to use you what you need to say is God if you put a word on my mouth and by the way just so you know the word that God will often put on your mouth will be the Bible the written word of God is becomes the", "Rhema or the spoken word of God when you are sensitive to the Holy Spirit if it's not the exact verbatim scripture it'll be a principle from God's word but you're not to add to it or something you don't need to come up well this would be a nice thought or I can't say that oh no if God's going to use you you need to be willing to say What God Says and accept the consequences but keeping that in mind it's going to be a blessing it's going to edify it's going to encourage it's going to comfort but God wants to use you you know what I love about this study of Balaam this we're discovering that God's heart is for his people so completely beautifully blessing them and blessing and blessing them and we know they aren't they're not like well they've just been walking by the spirit for years and no sin no they've been blowing it left and right and isn't it encouraging to know that as the Lord is looking at you and the enemy Satan would I gotta get them cursed I'm gonna get them the Lord's saying I just want to bless them I want to bring blessing on their life you don't see my people the way Isaac here's the problem Satan will never see you the way God sees you question is will you see his people will you see you the way that God sees you because I'll tell you something there's nothing like realize I am the one song puts it this way we are the object of God's Mighty love greater than my finite mind can conceive God is just cited to pour His blessing on his people you are a chosen race a royal Nation a people for God's Own possession that he might declare the excellencies of him who called you out of darkness and the light just if nothing else if that doesn't move you you must be sick or tired just say thank you God I do agree that that's true you have chosen to bless me of all the peoples on the planet I'm a part of the people that you want to reflect you that you want people to see how they talk about me is going to affect them do you understand I don't think you do I don't think I do how incredibly wonderful it is to be a child of God and I I know we have problems I know we have struggles I know we have failures I know but the Lord is saying would you just let yourself saturate my blessing I'll", "end with this the worship people can come in Romans 5 it says having been justified by faith we have peace with in other words if you're a Christian you have been declared not guilty more than that you're not just declared not guilty you're actually declared righteous that's what it means having been Justified declared righteous we have now peace with God we don't have to worry about that we're going to go to hell or he's going to change his mind we have an eternal peace with God no condemnation and it says and not only that we have received our introduction into this in which we stand and the word in the verb in the Greek and we stand is in the perfect tense it's not something we visit it's not something we skip through it's something we are standing in Forever you have received if you become a Christian Grace a Grace that you now permanently stand on your worst moment as a Christian see sometimes you go well before as a Christian God could forgive thou but now I'm Christian you don't forgive me anymore that's not the way it is you are standing in Grace now someone has gotten the wrong idea that I've said it's okay to sin because it's all forgiven can I tell you read Romans 6 if you thought I've ever said that I've never said that but I am here to tell you that when you do sin you need to realize that God has already forgiven you in Christ you want to apply it to your life by confessing it and asking for forgiveness is there a consequence for us when we say absolutely we break fellowship with God but you will never lose you'll never lose your sonship or your daughtership so tonight don't be looking at your life in terms of how well you're walking with the Lord for your joy say God you've decided to make me an example of Grace and guess what that means it means that you have to forgive me in other words you've decided that I would be proof that you're a merciful god that you're a gracious God that doesn't mean that I'm doing so good it means that I need it he sees you with all of your swiss cheese failures every hole in your life and he says I love just the way you are because I'm going to make you to be just like my son amen let's all stand and we'll close this on you are around me with a melody you surround me with the song from my enemies", "Who I Am a Child of God I'm no longer I am surrounded by The Arms Of Fire I am surrounded I mean I'm really struggling with this and with that and can just for a moment can you just either remember when you used to be a non-Christian or imagine having your problems and being a can that change is Connie the perspective doesn't it like the Bible says you used to be lost but you're not lost anymore the Bible says you used to be dead and now you're alive the Bible says you had no idea where you came from and why you're here now you do you had no idea where you're going you had no clue but you know that now you have the promises of God the presence of God the power of God the people of God God's pouring blessings in your lap and if you're still complaining I say your eyes aren't open so stop griping start praising and saying Lord I I don't have any right to complain I have every right and need to praise so let me praise you you put into perspective my problems I'll cast my Care on you you handle them just use me for your glory because I want to speak your blessing on other people I don't want to be so funny have you heard my problems I'm sick and I'm having hard times and you know looking for someone who wants to listen nobody wants to listen to that nobody want no no offense God will listen to you but he really wants you to be a fountain of blessing to other people you say well I can't you can't I don't if Paul and Silas can praise God in the midst of being beaten without knowing how long they're going to be in prison why they're in prison you know what you can you might not feel like it might not seem possible but I got news for you that's part of the miracle that God will give you joy and peace and the ability to minister to others Jesus go read what Jesus did on the cross how many people did he minister to while he was dying in sin you're not dying in your sin you're not dying yet but if he could bless them he's he wants to use your mouth to bless somebody else so go bless somebody tonight on your way home on your way here wait you're already here here find someone to bless at the if you're going out to eat like some of us go bless the waiter", "with Peter and I just want you to see it it's in acts 2 and verse 14 it's these first few words but Peter taking his stand what does the next word say with the eleven you don't read that anytime before this it was just Peter the power flow you know Peter the magnificent Peter the one who's more spiritual than everyone else but when the Holy Spirit is on Peter he takes his stand with everybody else may I suggest to you one of the evidences of being filled with the Holy Spirit is your relationship with other Christians will grow we're to speak to one another in Psalms and hymns and spiritual songs when we're filled with the Spirit we have a connection with the body of Christ so here's a question that I have for you who are you running with we're to run from sin were to run toward sanctification who are you I said before the word to run from temptation as the word where we get the word fugitive a fugitive is always running always never stops constantly always on the run so don't run with those who are running towards sin don't run with those who run from responsibility don't run with those who run from being under Authority say I want to run with those who are running from the right things and toward the right things put this down realize prayer makes you more reflective because in verse 22 he says we're to do that with those who call on the Lord from a pure heart now who's that well those who call on the Lord is talking about saved people whoever shall call on the name of the Lord will be saved but it's more than that that I want you to see there's a lot of ways to describe Christians he could have said when you are with other Saints but here it's talking about prayer that's what to call on the Lord means that's one of the reasons by the way I pray with people to receive Christ and you should too because the Bible says whoever will call on the Lord that's a prayer God's waiting to hear from us maybe some of you are here like I said earlier and you're you're praying for your spouse to be saved and you've been praying for a long time or like many of us you're praying for a prodigal son or a daughter to return to Christ you know after I received the Lord my first awareness was my family needs to get saved and I was kind of passionate about that I was", "pretty young so I didn't know my Bible I didn't know the gospel and I knew nothing of how the Lord wanted me to minister like I hadn't changed much but I had received Christ and I knew it was real I knew God was real I knew he was alive in my life so I wanted my sisters and my brother my mom my dad to have my experience and I was just genuine about my problem was my approach because I kind of habitually started telling them that they weren't saved and that's really hard when somebody thinks they are saved or worse somebody who is saved who you don't think is saved isn't that an embarrassing thing when you after years of trying to witness to somebody you finally realized oh wow I made a big mistake there I'm trying to get somebody saved - it just wasn't saved the way I was saved but I was ignorant of all that at the time and so I was offensive in my approach I don't know why telling somebody they're going to hell would be offensive but I what I do now and I was trying to get everybody to pray the prayer I think some of you heard me say that my mom would get up before I'd get up every morning she'd read her Bible and pray I spell that's just religion she needs Jesus and because if she if she knew Jesus she wouldn't do this or would do that or whatever it was you know so I remember I one day I said to her mom would you want to pray because yeah she was really excited about that and she said what do you want to pray about I said well I just actually would like you to pray what what do you mean I mean I didn't know what how to say it back then so I just showed her the back of the four spiritual law booklet where there was this prayer she goes well that's to receive Christ I go right she said well I'm already a Christian I know he think you are just just say the words for me I think she did but I I struggled so much some of my family clearly didn't know the Lord they had gone to church and they quit as soon as they were allowed to I wanted to be in a Bible teaching Church and I started growing spiritually but I prayed for I don't know probably it was a long maybe two weeks for their salvation before I gave up was 13 and I", "just decided well I tried I guess they're they're just not gonna come till I was about 18 most of my family and moved out of my house by then I'm married I'm the youngest so they were having kids and living life doing their some were going to church but I don't I didn't think they were saved and I'm pretty sure they weren't by this time I'm starting to get a sense of God's calling me into the ministry and I started studying the Bible but that was the last topic I ever brought up with my parents because all that led to were arguments even though I love the Lord I loved his word he wasn't the focus of our relationship and our family but God started ministering to me that I just needed to seek Him for me I used to pray for their salvation I I'll be honest today I I stopped praying so much about their salvation I just started asking the Lord to help me be a good reflection to him it was about six months of praying every day and that was a new thing in my life I had not done that up to that time and after about six months listen to the day but about six months out of the blue my mom said hey Bobby that's what was my name in that house hey Bobby we're wondering if you'd like to have a Bible study I thought are you talking to me there's some other Bobby here that you a Bible study yes she said I'd like we'd like you to teach it what and by the way your sisters coming and her husband from Mountain Riverside and your your niece Michelle be there oh by the way my friend she's gonna join us too and your grandma grandpa hi grandma grandpa they don't go to church anymore never have yeah they all want to come my mom had put together a Bible study a family Bible study without telling me and and now I'm just gonna come teach it it was amazing people started getting saved from day one my mom who was saved I didn't know it recommitted her life the first night my sister from Riverside gave her life to the Lord that night told me that next week when she came back she said we were singing the same hymns at church but they sound like they're completely new her daughter Michelle gave her life to Jesus that night she's still walking with the Lord after all these years my dad gave His life back to cry my grandparents never prayed the prayer at", "the end of each one of these little family bible studies I didn't know what better to do so I just had it really close her eyes and I'd give a chance to receive crisis if you want to receive price raise your hand that's all I had ever seen you know raise your hands a little group in the living room and so every week I give an opportunity to receive Christ and my brother-in-law who was Catholic did not pray because he didn't need to he was already a Christian and he wanted to know when he could teach the Bible stay my grandma grandpa just politely sat there for a better part of a year every mile state never responded but a year after the Bible study was over my Jerry Catholic called me on the phone and he said hey I wanted to talk to you said you know that that prayer that you used to pray at the end of the Bible study I said yeah he said well I'd like to I'd like I'd like to pray that and I said awesome Jerry when can we get together he said oh no right now he said I'm already on my knees go ahead he was waiting for the sinner's prayer and Jerry gave his life to the Lord my grandfather my last conversation with my grandfather was that st. Jude he died of cancer of the lymph system and I went in to say goodbye his eyes were closed he couldn't hardly he couldn't really talk but he could hear me and I said grandpa it's it's it's Bobby I said grandpa all right are you ready to die and he shook his head and I didn't know what else to say so I said remember remember that prayer that I used to ask people to pray at the end of the Bible study shook his head yes I said grandpa did you ever did you ever pray that prayer and I said would you like to right now my last words to my grandpa were to introduce him to my Savior listen to me here's what I want you to know there's something about prayer in your life that can make you usable to the master that nothing else can I want you to think about what happened in the scriptures Moses goes up on the mountain to receive the Word of God the tablets and then the Bible says while he's talking to God something changed in him jot it down Exodus 34 verse 29 it came about when Moses was coming down from the mountain", "and the tablets were in his hand as he was coming down from the mountain the Bible says the he did not know that the skin of his face shone because he had been speaking to God it's interesting he didn't even know it but as he's talking to Lord that's prayer he starts reflecting God think of Jesus on the Mount of Transfiguration he went up to a prayer meeting that's why he went up there according to scriptures Moses and Elijah are there Moses and Elijah are the two witnesses that testified to who Jesus are the law and the prophets the Word of God we see the Word of God involved in both and prayer involved in both and Jesus is transfigured here's what he he says I'll close with this Corinthians it says we go from glory to glory beholding as in a mirror the glory of the Lord what is the mirror the mirror of God's glory is his word as we are in his word and as we're communing and talking to him though we don't know it God is making us more useful to him my family that got saved and many of did had nothing to do with me witnessing to them it had to do with me spending time in prayer to where I stopped being a roadblock so I just want to encourage you keep praying for those that are lost and those that are fallen and those that are prodigal but believe that God is changing you to use you when it's time on behalf of our pastors and staff we want to thank you for tuning into today's video if you want to stay informed about what's going on here at Calvary Chapel usse Anaheim we'd love for you to subscribe to our Channel go ahead and do so by clicking the button", "mind should I have gone with him it was an irrecoverable moment let's pray Lord we need to remind ourselves and to that your promise to come is in black and white and just as assuredly as you came two thousand years ago you're Lord you told us we can't know the day of the hour Lord forgive us for so much study about the timing and not living in such a way that is ready for it whenever you come back Lord thank you there is no loss living as though you would come back today even if you don't in fact that's why you want us to not know help us to be about our father's business help us to be on Mission you've given us a brand new year on our calendar but Lord we want to live this new year in a new way that honors you so I pray for anyone who's never come to know you who is not alive spiritually they're dead totally asleep that they would wake up by coming to Christ but Lord I pray for your bride that we would decide that we want to live in light of the fact that you're coming and live in a way that you can be pleased when you come so Lord our prayer is even so come quickly Lord Jesus it's in your name we pray amen", "Lord we need no other hiding

um I hope you're enjoying uh the worship so far and we are yeah they do a great job we're going through the Bible and so we're glad you're joining us for that Adventure we're in the book", "of Deuteronomy me but before we open if you are new you probably aren't getting our text messages you're probably the only people in the room who aren't but on the uh screens right now very easy just text ccea to 5976 n and you'll you'll be aware during Wednesday sometime uh during the day what we're serving for food and uh just a reminder that we're having Service Plus other to time so take advantage of that it's free and then um I want to encourage you uh all of you if you have not yet put someone's name on the cross out here uh it's a good reminder that we're getting ready of course in not too long a week from this Friday to celebrate uh the Lord's death and uh what he did on the cross and he did it he died for for us he died for individuals he died for Sinners and that's all of us but I want you to encourage you to be thinking beyond your own appreciation of what the Lord has done for you we all do that we want to reown our Savior on Good Friday and and Easter Sunday but I want you to start thinking about the Lord applying that work hopefully that you already know he's done in your life to somebody else that you know and love um and maybe you'll invite him to come Good Friday or maybe you'll invite him to come Sunday but whether you can or not you just a reminder that they died uh that Jesus died for them and and that you're going to be praying for them so there's a a cross out there there's a way to take a piece of paper roll it up put your the name of someone on there and and stick it in there you can do more than one if you want or put more names on one little piece of paper but I really do want to encourage you to take advantage of that it's a good reminder and then um our men meet on Friday mornings usually for uh um a breakfast and a Bible study but once a month and it happens to be this Saturday uh the fourth Saturday of each month they meet in our gymnasium at 88 a.m. a little easier for folks that have to be at work on Fridays but if you're interested we'd love every guy is invited every time they meet but 8: a.m. this Friday for breakfast and a study this particular study is going to be given by Pat butes and it's going to be", "a study on the uh Lord's Prayer and most of us grew up at least being familiar with the Lord's Prayer maybe some of you have been repeating it since you were a child and and maybe sometimes you find yourself repeating actually praying The Lord's Prayer I I use the Lord's Prayer all the time I don't necessarily always pray it exactly the way he gave it because he said pray like this he didn't say pray this so I don't think he wants us just to pray those exact words but it is a really excellent study because there are seven actual prayer requests did you know that in the Lord's Prayer what is the very first prayer request that he gave us in the Lord's Prayer does anybody know the very first one what is it a prayer for yes that's right Hallowed be thy name which most of us grew up thinking that was just an ascription of praise to God your name is Holy it's actually a request let your name be holy when's the last time you prayed that maybe never so anyway guys seven requests going over for those this Saturday and you're invited of course other Fridays at 6:30 in our um gymnasium also and then our school of discipleship which is already trimester than ever before it's been amazing uh several the classes have over 70 people it's it's really excellent but one of the um studies that I mentioned uh is unique that is the one that um Bob gascan is doing on uh biblical financial principles and even if you have not signed up for the class we're going to just let you know the uh the topic each Sunday in case you want to just sit in kind of audit it you don't have to sign up you just have to show up so 3 p.m. this this uh Sunday in the sanctuary and they're going to talk about the importance of budgeting what budgets are about and that and I guess how to do it so if you're interested you can just come out for that one class and sit in it's an hour class on Sunday but we wanted you to be aware of it all right now it's time open your Bibles to Deuter Deuteronomy Deuteronomy chapter six we got through verse uh 15 last time so we'll pick it up in verse 16 and let me read while you uh either read your Bible or read the screens but 6:16 you shall not put the Lord your God to the test as you tested him at Massa you should diligently keep the", "Commandments of the Lord your God and His testimonies and his statutes which he commanded you but you shall do what is right and good in the sight of the Lord that it may be well with you and that you may go in and possess the good land which the Lord swore to give your fathers by driving out all your enemies from before you as the Lord has spoken when your son asks you in time to come saying what do the testimonies and statutes and the judgments mean which the Lord Our God commanded you then you shall say to your son we were slaves to Pharaoh in Egypt and the Lord brought us from Egypt with a mighty hand moreover the Lord showed great and distressing signs and wonders before our eyes against Egypt pharaoh and all his household he brought us out from there in order to bring us in to give us the land which he had sworn to our fathers so the Lord commanded us to observe all these statutes to fear the lord Our God for our good always and for our survival as it is today it'll be righteous for us if we are careful to observe all this commandment before the Lord Our God just as he commanded us father tonight we many of us had a big long day and some of us have had a big meal and now we'd love to be asleep but we don't want to be asleep Lord we want to hear from you and I thank you Lord that you have something to say to every person who's willing to ask and receive and so Lord you said to the churches Jesus you said that they are to hear what the spirit is saying to the churches and so Lord tonight this word in Deuteronomy we know isn't just for Israel it's not just for the church Universal and and eternal it is for us tonight here in Anaheim so would you open our hearts to behold wonderful things from this scripture for it's in Jesus name we pray amen anden you can be seated well you know we're uh as we're going through the book of Deuteronomy of course there is a lot said about the law the law is being Revisited dudo Second anas Law the second giving of the law and for those of you that don't know this already many of you who come know this it is this 30-day or uh period um right before uh the children of Israel will go into the promised land it's it's it's interesting because the book before it took 40 years", "uh of time to cover and this book is just a very short uh amount of time but it's very important so much happened in that month because Moses is getting ready to die and he can't die God won't take him home and and bury him until uh he prepares the nation uh and he's not going in with them so it's a it's an important time in his life of transition and finally for this younger generation to go in and take the promised land and to be equipped and so it's a it's a a a boot camp basically a a Bible boot camp to really remind them of what God's word says the promises of God and the and really the warnings of God if they don't obey the word and so you can't really overemphasize how important the Bible is I think when a person receives Christ and now you know they made this decision it's really hard to articulate to them important this book needs to become for the rest of their life not just a book that you believe oh that's an important book you know I should read it sometime or there's a lot of good truth in there and I respect it now but that God wants to take you through this book and give you lessons and truths that will affect not just the rest of your life but the rest of your eternity you know you only have the rest of your life to study this book for eternity some people like to cram right before the final I think but the reality is you want to spend time with the Lord in his word and let God speak to you and you know I I like to remind myself that and I've shared it many times that Parable that Jesus told about the two men wi isn't a fool you you some of us have been singing it since we were a kid remember right the wise men built his house upon a rock and rains came a tumbling down and of course the house on the rock stood firm but that foolish man he built his house on yeah the sand and the rains well they're coming doesn't matter where you build your house the rains are coming coming but his house fell flat because of where he built it how he built it and then Jesus just simply teaches the difference between the wise men and the fool is not one's an atheist and one's a God-fearing man no they both actually hear the word of God but one does", "nothing with it the fool hears the word maybe even loves Bible study maybe even comes on Wednesday nights so I don't know but he never does anything with it Jesus Jesus said if you know these things blessed are you if you cross reference them no tell somebody else no if you do them the blessings in doing them and so that's why you're going to find Moses going over again you feel like I we've already had this Bible study yep and we'll keep having it because the Lord knows we're kind of some of us uh hard of hearing sometimes so put this down we're talking tonight about obedience but God will test you that's true God tests us but you are not to test him God will test you but you are not to test him if you're taking notes put in the words you and him and look at verse 16 you shall not put the Lord your God to the test and then there's an example of the way you're not to do it as you tested him at Massa now we fail God's test of us when we start to test him put this down don't doubt God's provision for you and talking about testing him we want to talk about a couple of examples of this from the scripture so put in the word provision the reference in our text is way back in Exodus 17 so it's been a while since we studied it together but the children of Israel have uh now been saved out of Egypt and um they find out in the desert out in the wilderness they don't have water and basically the Lord allows them to be thirsty clearly wanting to know well what will they do when they get thirsty and they don't have water and it's not that he's playing with them you know what are you going to do when you don't have something you need and uh so that's what happens in Exodus 17 that's a big question you know they've just gotten saved God's presence is leading them it's not like Where's God I mean he's he's he's manifesting his presence he's done all these miraculous signs back in Egypt and so the question will they do will they pray will they bring their need to the Lord will they will they accuse Moses yes that's exactly what they will do they will not pray they will accuse Moses he's the guy in front who's supposed to be close to God it seems like somebody's forgotten about them this doesn't make any we we've been", "saved out of Egypt and now we're going to die of thirst in in the wilderness and so it's interesting because before Exodus 17 it looked like they were going to die when the Egyptians were about to destroy them before The Parting of the Red Sea the Egyptian Army is chasing them and they start complaining and what they said was were there no graves in Egypt I mean there are pyramids in Egypt there's lots of graves in Egypt Egypt is all about the dead by the way if you're not familiar with Egyptian culture were there no not enough graves in Egypt that you had to bring us out here to die in the desert then in Exodus 15 uh there was already no drinkable water they found some water but it wasn't drinkable and they started complaining not against God but against Moses it's always easier to complain against some person than God because you know can't blame God for anything even though you're really blaming God when you blame the authority that's over you did you know that and so now we're not going to die by the Egyptians we're not going to die by an an Annihilation we're going to die by dehydration we got no water we got water water everywhere but not a drop to drink you can't drink and that's when God healed the water remember that's when they added through the tree into the water cuz we all throw a tree in water you can drink it no but this tree you can cuz it's a symbol of the type of the Cross really made it sweet then they get to Exodus 17 after those incidents have already happened and they say why have you brought us out of Egypt so that we and our children and our cattle should all die by thirst basically you're killing us Moses I mean literally that's what they thought and it's not them that pray it's Moses that prays because he's afraid they're going to kill him he says you know there this this multitude is about to kill me for for them not having any water and he has told what to do and of course he's told well here's what I want you to do Moses take your staff and hit the rock right there and I'm sure he's going well that'll work you know when's the last time you struck a rock in a water fountain you know but God just says strike the Rock and when he strikes the rock water pours out of this rock and is enough to literally satisfy the thirst", "of this entire multi and this is an incredible Miracle it's also told later in the Bible in 1 Corinthians 10 it's a typon it's a picture of Christ who was smitten who was put on the cross once and life poured out of him and so very interesting it's not until somebody in this case Moses prays that the situation changes have you ever found that have you ever found that to be the case that you you get real frustrated with your circumstance you're a Christian you know the Lord you know he's come through for you before but you kind of forget to pray do you know there are times it happened just a couple days ago uh we couldn't make something work and my grandson said maybe we should pray you know it's like well wait that's my line you know I'm the grandpa I'm the pastor I said you are right let's do that you know what does the old song say oh what peace we often forfeit oh what needless pain we Bear all because we do not carry everything to God and prayer and so that place was named Massa that's what it's referring to in verse 16 the word Massa in Hebrew test and was also called meraba which means quarrel because there God said my people tested me um now God's always faithful he always passes the test but they shouldn't have thought he's not going to provide for what he saved us out it has the power to save us but not to Keep Us Alive and so often that's really what we're doing with God God you're abandoning me you saved me from hell but now you're I lost my job and God's going see I'm you're testing me and you're failing my test you know put this down not only don't doubt God's provision for you but don't doubt God's protection of you now why would I say that well because this verse you already know this probably is quoted in the New Testament by Jesus himself remember after Jesus was baptized the Bible says the spirit of God drove him out into the Wilderness to be tested of the devil for 40 days here the children of Israel are there for 40 years and of course they didn't pass their test very well at all but Jesus will go out and he will pass the tests of Temptation and then he'll enter into his ministry but uh one of the test is uh Temptations is mentioned in Matthew if you want to jot it down Matthew 4: 5-7 then the devil took Jesus into the", "holy city the quest Jerusalem and he had him stand on the Pinnacle that's that's the corner of the temple it's the highest point and he said to him if you are the Son of God then throw yourself down for it is written and he quotes the Bible he God will give his angels charge concerning you on their hands they'll bear you up lest you strike your foot against a stone and Jesus said on the other hand it is written it's our verse Deuteronomy 6:16 you shall not put the Lord your God to the test now Luke tells us when he records these three Temptations remember Luke at the beginning of his gospel though he was not a eyewitness of the accounts of Jesus like Matthew was like John was Luke did his research uh with eyewitnesses and he said I'm writing down everything consecutively in order that it happened some of the other writers arranged their materials differently Luke said but I'm writing it in order it's interesting because Luke when he writes about that Temptation we find out it's actually the final Temptation The Last Temptation Of Christ that that occurred before Satan uh took off and and gave up it's interesting because in that Temptation something very unique happens that doesn't happen in the other two Temptations uh you might say the devil and Jesus kind of engage in a sword fight both the devil and Jesus quote scripture at each other the devil quotes 91 and Jesus basically says I'll see your PSAL and I'll raise you Deuteronomy 6 and and uh comes back at him saying you know you're quoting scripture to me about the protection of God so I should throw myself down and of course if I do then these the angels will have to protect me you know I won't die I'll it look like I'll have to die you you don't jump off the Pinnacle and you make it by the way that's where they used to kill people when they would Stone them to death James was killed by being thrown off the edge of the temple no nobody lives when you fall off the edge of the temple so the idea is hey when you when you just gently come down to the Earth when the Angels catch you man everyone will know that you're the Messiah basically it was a temptation to not have to go to the Cross to be recognized as the Messiah and of course he wasn't going to fall for that Temptation listen God does promise us there in Psalm 91 and many many other places he promises", "Supernatural protection the angels of the Lord the angel of the Lord encamps around those who fear Him the Bible says that's you Jesus spoke of children he said their angels are constantly before my father they're they're being pro they're being protected have you ever wondered you know what your what your angel I mean not just looks like but what what that angel has been assigned to you what they've had to do in your life some of you your angels have been squished protecting you from some car that was going to hit you probably and you're going to get to heaven your angels is going to be one with a big black and blue and no I'm just kidding but they've gone through a lot protecting we just don't know all that they've gone through but we have no doubt the supernatural protection of God is upon every believer we are told that in the scriptures but while it's true that's in the word of God what what the devil was quoting was in the Bible certainly applies to Jesus I believe it applies to more than Jesus but it definitely applied to Jesus while that's true God doesn't let me please hear me on this God doesn't allow me and you to dictate how and when he must protect us he promises to protect protect us but he doesn't allow us to dictate how it's going to happen well if he's protecting me then why did I get sick and why was I in the hospital why did I almost die see that's really when you when you start doing that you're adding to what God has said jot down Proverbs 30: 5 and 6 every word of God is tested he is a shield to those who take refuge in him but don't add to his words lest he prove you and you be proved to be a liar you know that idea well God's determined the day of my birth Psalm 139 and according to Psalm 139 also the day of my death God is counted you know the number of your days he knows when you're going to die you don't but he does so basically this kind of person says so actually until it's my time to die I'm absolutely indestructible until then so I can jump off a cliff and God will have to save me and then when you die God will say today was your appointed day I just thought I'd let you know that's putting the Lord to the test that's not what this you can't dictate to God how he protects you that's not up", "to you put this down know and share the blessings of obedience of obedience in verse 17 you should diligently keep the Commandments of the Lord your God and testimonies and his statutes which he has commanded you now we are studying the law of God or what we would consider the word of God because that the law is God's word but three different descriptions in our text in verse 17 first it refers to them as God's commandments so we can say this God's word reveals God's will for us God's word Reveals His will it we give get our orders from headquarters as we read the Bible you know um but then it also refers to them as God's testimonies so not only does the word of God reveal the will of God for me that I need to obey but it also reveals if you will God's ways the Bible the word are his testimonies why they testify to us not just of what his will is for us but they testify to us of his character so in some 19 when it says the law of the Lord is perfect it's revealing who God is the word reflects the character of God you see the testimonies of the Lord Psalm 19 are sure you can you can trust them it reveals who he is it tells us about what not only what he wants me to do but what he's like himself so we have the Bible being the revelation of God's will but also the revelation of God's ways and then it refers to them as statutes now a statute is something that is written it's a written law that you know our legislature will enact but it is written for our benefit jot down Romans 15 and verse4 there Paul says this whatever was written in earlier times now he's not talking about ancient literature he's just talking about the Bible whatever was written referring to scripture that was written whatever was written in earlier times it was all written for our instruction that through person perseverance and the encouragement of the scriptures we might have hope and so these three descriptions of of the word of God and that final one that word statutes in the Hebrew actually is a word mishpat which means judgments God's word if you will passes sentence God's judgment on an issue what does um there's an old song that says is so sweet to trust in Jesus just to just to just to know Jesus and just to hear thus sayeth the Lord it was talking about the scriptures in that", "song and I love that song just what does God say you know look our our world is full I think a cable news is just about 99% opinions a few facts thrown in but mostly it's opinions editorials that everybody wants to hear somebody else's opinion who's a expert on this or an expert on that and the opinions of man are ever coming and by the way ever changing but the great need of every hour is what does God say what what does the Lord say because that's not going to change and it's always right um years ago I I realized we needed to not just go through the Bible but we needed to go through some important current topics of the day that Christians were asking about so I did a series I think it was on W or maybe Sunday nights and it was called what the Bible says about what is the I say about marriage what does the Bible say about finances or money what does the Bible say about friendship what does the Bible say about sex you know God created it by the way not Hugh Hefner or somebody else it was God he has some things to say about what does the Bible say about family what what does the Bible say about forgiveness what does the Bible say about suicide what does the Bible say about heaven because the Bible talks about all these things we need to know what God says instead of what somebody's opinion is about it including man that's man that's in the Pulpit we need need to know what God says put this down when we obey things go well that's what the scripture says now listen mean you're not going to have trials but look at 17 you should diligently keep the Commandments of the Lord your God and His testimonies and his statutes which he has commanded you you shall do what is right and good in the sight of the Lord that it may be well with you there a correlation you should obey you should give yourself to it that you blessed in the 1960s there was a jingle that cocacola used in their commercials things go Coke um was popular Little tune that they would put in their commercials someone took that and changed the tune and and they made it things go better with Christ I happen to like that one a better but maybe you're asking is that is is that really true just today a uh survey or a study came out of the nations of the world that somebody", "conducts they ask people of every country on this Earth U how happy they are the United States is going downhill by the way just so you know it it was in the top 20 for years and years and years until this year uh it actually uh dropped from number 15th happiest place to live to number 23 so it went it went way down especially among younger people um if you've been to Disneyland or you're just familiar you know they have a sign that says it's the happiest place on Earth that's true when you're about 4 11 after that it gets a little more expensive and it's kind of not always the happiest place it's the most expensive place in Orange County anyway but Disney thinks it's the happiest place on Earth but I I personally believe obedient Saints are the happiest earth I really do why do I say that is it really true is happiness something that's afforded us well David says happy I I think blessed is the right word it's a little different but blessed are the people or happy are the people whose God is the Lord so you should feel Most Blessed most fortunate if you want to use the word happy I won't play games with words with you it's not the right word because happiness has more to do with chance hap Happ it's a word that means my love which I don't believe in but you're the most blessed people on Earth and I do believe even like Solomon talked about in the scriptures you you may know this passage Proverbs 29:18 but I think it's often misunderstood where there is no vision yeah King James says the people perish uh translation might be more like where there's no vision the people are unrestrained but notice this happy is he who keeps the law the vision this is often quoted we need Vision because the leader has have Vision if you don't have Vision then the people are going to just be bummed out well that's probably not exactly what the original language says there it's the way the English comes across it's talking about the law and it's talking about where you don't have vision and understanding of what God says you don't have any kind of restraints on you and you're not in a good place but happy is the person who keeps the law it's talking about the word of God and its effect on a person's life I I think that um for a person who remembers their life before they knew the word of God or cared about obeying", "the word of God and you see the difference of what the Bible what God has done through the truth of the Bible it's the Lord but he uses his word you can fully understand that song uh it was written back in 1887 when we walk with the Lord in the light of his word what a glory he sheds on our way while we do his good will he abides with us still and with all all that will trust and Obey trust and Obey there's no better way there's no other way to be happy in Jesus than to trust and Obey you see a lot of times people think well God just doesn't want us to do stuff that's fun God's the big Cosmic kill Joy everything that I want to do I saw bumper sticker that once that said why is it everything I want to do in life is illegal immoral or fattening you sin has been called The Monkey Wrench in Machinery now if you don't know what a monkey wrench is it doesn't really matter what kind of wrench you throw into a machine it really doesn't matter if it's a monkey wrench or a crowbar it's just not belonging in there the gears are going to get ripped up and it's going to mess things up and it's going to tear things up and that's what families look like and that's what people's lives look like because of sin if you want to know the effects of sin because the Bible says the wages of sin is death but if you want see the human effects of sin if you really want to understand it look at Jesus on the cross that's the effect of sin the Bible says God made him who knew no sin to become sin for us God judged him in your sin and in my sin in the Sin of man that's what sin does it separates you from God it separates you from your loved ones it'll tear you'll have nothing left it'll it'll rip your entire life off that's what sin does that's to call it the monkey wrench the Machinery is a little gratuitous in my opinion when people think of the law of God and I mentioned this before to you they think well these are these rules that we have to keep and I think that's just a terrible thing you you got to understand the other side of it think of the law of gravity the law of gravity was not created to punish us the law of gravity just is okay God created within his", "Universe now you don't have to obey it but you defy it to your own hurt that's the bottom line it's not made to to punish you but if you don't believe in it or you reject it you will hurt yourself I remember hearing of a church camp up in the mountains these kids were there Elementary agid School and the the teacher was a young man that was one of the youth leaders and he was saying you know everything God made has a purpose that's true the Bible says he's made everything for it it has a purpose and um so he said every all these trees everything you see the birds and the sky and the stars and the sun he would say everything has a purpose and one kid yeah what's the purpose of poison ivy and he goes uh he was I'm not really sure about that another kid said I think I know what he goes I think God created some things to teach us to there's things we're supposed to keep our cotton picking hands off of well there are things that God has said don't do that because it'll hurt you and many of us have tested that out and found out you know what he was right he was right God says I want you to have a sexual relationship in the Covenant of marriage it's not that it won't be fun outside of it but it will be destructive in Proverbs it says uh passion uh the passions of the the lust of the flesh sexual lusts are like a fire you know can a man put fire into his chest or into his bosom and not be burned Ian that's a cause and effect if you're going to have if you're going to touch fire you're going to get burned fire is really great when it's in the right place and it's under control but when it's not in the right place oh it's still fire but it destroys and it does it very very quickly anyone I don't know if anyone here has lost anybody or known anybody that was lost on a fire but uh if you aren't aware you do not realize how quickly a fire can get out of control and take someone's life I'm talking seconds and I happen to have a dear friend who lost his mom in a house fire that you wouldn't believe it would be possible that it could happen that fast but that's what God says stay away from it not because I'm trying to take pleasure away from you but because I", "know how much it'll destroy you um when it says to be well it'll be well with you it's an interesting word in the Hebrew um it it of course includes it'll be things will be well with you circumstantially but I think it also means and at times it means to be well with you just internally um it's very interesting there's a passage in the Old Testament where there's a woman she's known in the scriptures that the shunamite woman who um blessed Elisha by she was a woman of means and she provided her and her husband provided a a place for him when he was in town and would provide food for him he was a you know you know a prophet who had to trust the Lord for his food and on one occasion she he he says to her after years of her ministering uh to him is there anything we you know I can do for you what would you like and she was childless and her husband was old she was old she had no children so no one to carry on their name and and so Elisha tells her you're going to have a son it's kind of like a it's kind of like an Abraham and Sarah story you know or Zachariah story in the New Testament somebody who's just GI up on that hope that's never going to happen and uh but he said you're going to you're going to have a son next time I see you and sure enough she gets pregnant and she Bears a son and it's this miracle boy and he boy grows up goes out into the field to work with his dad and something happens he just says my head my head he has some kind of horrific head pain we don't know exactly medically what it was and aneurism or something he's you know just seems like a horrible headache but he goes home lays down on his mom's lap he's a grown Young Man by this time he's have a little baby but he uh he dies in her lap and uh this this promised child you know and her husband's still out in the field so she goes to her husband doesn't tell him about the boy dying but she says uh I I need to go see the man of God Elisha and um he says well why it's not the new moon it's not the festival why is it is everything well she says it is well and then um she goes with the servant on a donkey and she's telling", "him you know we got to get going here and Elisha sees her coming from a distance and sends out his servant gesi go you know this is this is go find out if everything's okay you know go meet her halfway or whatever down the road there so gesi the servant goes out and says is everything okay with you she says it's well he says what about your husband it's well what about your son well she refuses to tell him anything which actually in the scheme of things knowing anything about she shouldn't have told him a word anyway he's not a trustworthy guy but anyway that's later a different story but um she finally gets to Elisha and she just pours her heart out and I was thinking about it very interesting you know might seem to the person who's just reading the story well she lied she lied to her husband she lied G I don't know that she did when Horatio spafford when they stopped the ship in the place where his daughters died when that ship went down he he penned those words when peace like a river attendeth my way when Sorrows like sea Billows roll whatever my lot you've taught me to say it is well it Is Well with My Soul I can be okay internally even when everything else is falling it's not just wishful thinking or positive thinking because I know whom I have believed I can trust him when I don't like don't understand don't want the things that he is allowing because he is the he is the Assurance of my heart that it's okay I'm going to be okay he is doing things in a way that I don't understand well put this down obey God in order to possess his promises we obey God to that things might go well in our soul and in our circumstances it doesn't mean we don't have trials it just means that they don't have we don't have the extra trials that we have from Disobedience but obey God in order to possess his promises in verse 18 He says you do it so it you you're obedient that it may go well with you and that you may go in he's talking about to the land of Canaan and you might possess the good land which the Lord swore to give your fathers so the idea is if if you want to experience those things God is promising in the Bible obedience not that we earn God's blessings but we put ourselves in the place where we can receive him there's", "an old saying you need to keep yourself under the spout where the blessings pour out um it's not that we are somehow now because we're so good God blesses us that's a mistake as though our performance earns it it's not that way but our sin will keep us from enjoying the presence of God and there's joy in his presence Psalm 1611 you want to have joy get into God's presence that's all that's where it is so if you're not in the presence of God or you're separated from God because your sin you're not going to have joy remember David when he kept quiet about his sin the Bible says he said I was like the fever Heat Of Summer your hand was heavy on me I had no I mean I was just drying up that's what happens when you're in sin it's not that God's punishing you your own sin is keeping you from enjoying God the way that you normally would maybe you came in tonight you feel I feel far from God I can't get into these songs that's it's the songs they chose well no it has nothing to do with that it has to do with you oh it has to do with you too understand you're schizophrenic bom listen God promises in the New Testament a piece that surpasses understanding you know what that means it means that it's a piece that does not make sense he promises you can have that but maybe you say I've never had that maybe you say I don't I just can't understand why I lack a piece that understanding see if you go to the doctor your doctor and you have a problem whatever it might be and the doctor does his tests and his evaluation and he he diagnoses your problem and writes you a prescription and you go home and you do some research on your condition and you like so many of us do you know you bring up the online Physicians Desk Reference and you want to know about the medicine and all and um so you understand how it's going to treat you and maybe some of the side effects um you won't get the effects of the medicine by studying the medicine um you don't get the help of a prescription by reading the prescription it might make you feel there's hope but it won't do a thing for body so when people say I have never had God promises me peace I don't have any well have you done what he said to do well I don't know what he said to do", "I just know he promised me it well then you haven't even read the prescription well you I you're talking about Philippians 4 yep that's the prescription for peace have you done it worry about nothing you say I can't even get past step one I'm worried I will never get it take heart Brothers and sisters if he tells you stop worrying you can God is not saying go do something I know you can't do now you can't do it without faith and you can't do it without his help and the man with the withered arm came to Jesus and Jesus said stretch forth your hand the God go wow what a joke stretch forth well stretch forth your hand no he couldn't stretch forth his hand until Jesus said stretch forth his hand and then he could did if he's telling you stop worrying you can how do I know cuz he's telling you and you need to believe his word more than what your experience has been be anxious for nothing so there's five steps by the way the this is a compounding pharmacy all five of these come before the promise FYI worry about nothing secondly pray everything so if you're sitting there thinking about what is going to happen stop that but start talking to God about it tell them Lord I I really want you to do this I I need you to I need you to help me pray for the peace pray for the problem to be resolved pray for God to be glorified he doesn't really tell you exactly what to pray but you can pray your heart let your desires be made known some now sometimes people instead of worrying they pray but all they do is somebody says is worry on your they worry on their knees oh so every everything's falling did you bring us out here to kill us in the wilderness oh wa yeah we're not really praying we're worrying we're just pretending to pray don't do that you be honest I'm afraid Lord Hezekiah was terrified and he had every reason to be terrified that Army was coming and he had no solution for it and he took that letter that condemning letter that was threatening him and it was a threatening letter we wiped everybody else out you think you're better than them think your God's better than our we we're wiping you out you're just next on the list list and hezeki is going there that's true they wiped everybody else out we're next went up into the temple and he just he spread that letter out before the", "Lord Lord this is what they're saying I don't know what to do just tell the Lord the truth I am scared I don't want to be worried but I'm scared Lord pray about everything and then just in case you want to stop keep praying it says be anxious for nothing but everything by supplication what is that where do I get a gallon of supplication it just means Earnest pray and don't stop don't just I prayed once I'm done check no no no Keep Jesus talked to his disciples about losing prayer that it's it's our temptation to go well that didn't work I tried it I let's try something else you know let's um don't stop praying pray and and continue to ask the lord lord be with the Lord let let your let your problems drive you into God's presence some of you have gone through trials in your life that were so difficult you've never been so close to the Lord as when you were in the worst situation in your life it's no mistake that Shadrach mesach and Abednego who are being executed in a fire suddenly and more a witness of Jesus being alive to the people around him in that moment and have to be commanded to leave the fire they didn't even want to come out some of you know pain some of you know suffering that has forced you into the presence of God in a way that nothing else could have nothing else has and it's not that you enjoyed the process but you were grateful for what it did because you allowed it to draw you to drive you to force you into the presence of God be anxious for nothing but in everything by prayer with Earnest intreaty seeking the Lord and then it says give thanks that's the last thing and I just want to say thank you this is the worst time in my life thank you that there'll never be any worse than this what am I going to say thank you for and we struggle right there that one doesn't come natural but listen you can thank God that you're talking to the god of the universe you can thank God that he has promised you it's working together for good though you don't have a clue you can thank God that he can give you peace and by the way there's many times I say God forget about solving my circumstances I know you could do that you didn't have to bring them all I need is peace just give me peace because I know you promised me peace you didn't", "promise that you'll solve my problem you never said I will change your circumstance remember what 1 Corinthians 10 says says no trial no temptation has overtaken you but such as is common to man in other words hey you're not the first person that's gone through this now that's never given me much oh yeah that makes me feel great misery loves company you know no no trial has overtaken you but such as is common to man and God is faithful he won't allow you to be tried or tempted beyond what you're able even though you think it is but with that trial with that Temptation we'll provide a way of Escape I've always liked that part of the verse it's like there's a way out there's an exit I want to find the exit where's the how do I get out of here except the rest of the verse explains where the exit is that you may be able to endure it it's like what I don't want to I don't want to endure nothing I want to get out of it that's the way you're getting out of this you're not getting out you're going through it remember what the scripture say when you go through the fire I don't want to even go in if I'm in it I want to be pulled out I don't want to go through it no no you're going through it how am I going to refine you if you don't spend some time in the fire no my your testimony is not you got out and that's over man God's good to get me out oh no no I need you to endure it with me because I'm going to change you more into my image so worry about nothing pray about everything keep praying and give thanks there's plenty to thank for you just got to think through that one a bit and then bring every thought into captivity to Christ now it doesn't say that in Philippians 48 that's elsewhere but it's actually the truth of it when it says whatever is true lovely pure excellent worthy of Praise think on these things listen you can't control how you feel you can't but you can control with God's help what you think about you can you can say I can't think about that I don't know if that's going to happen or that's an ugly thought or that's terrible I'm I'm focusing on the I'm going to I'm going to choose to stop thinking about that and believe me this is a big part of having peace you're not", "going to have peace if you don't obey Philippians 4:8 you can obey the rest if you don't believe Philippians 48 and choose what to think about you don't get peace sorry it's not available because as a man think as a woman thinketh in his heart so is you're whatever you're playing on that big screen of your own mind is going to affect your emotions listen I can take you to a scary movie I won't I don't believe in them but if I took you into a scary movie this is my analogy and uh uh we go into this horror movie and the lights are low right and off in the room and this terrible scenes going on people are dying and being whatever they do in scary movies and there's intense music playing it's like and you're freaking out your emotions are running wild now let me just be serious about this for a minute why are you afraid you're in a movie thi you paid money for this experience even about popcorn to enjoy while you're freaking out you're here on purpose not by mistake you're watching scenes on a screen there's there's not people in the room with a hacksaw or a chainsaw or whatever the M what you there's not a real person threatening you at all those and actresses that's not even real blood no one died no one even got hurt why are you freaking out you want to be freaked out you're letting yourself be freaked out you're hoping to be freaked out you're freaking out because you put yourself in a place where you filled your mind took some work but you got yourself there that's exactly what what you do when you sit around and you think about the worst possible outcome how terrible and awful this is going to be how ugly this is you do it you you're just playing the movie in your mind and you're pretending like you're on a train that's out of control going faster and faster and it's about to explode at the end of the rail hey your God is in charge of your trial you are not out of control but you let yourself think that way you do it to well when we obey things go well and obey God we start to enjoy his promises put this down number three obey God by driving out the enemy in verse 19 and by the way this we're just going to touch on this because this will be picked up big time in chapter 7 but in verse 19 he says uh we are to obey God by", "driving out all our enemies from before us as the Lord has spoken now God promised in the word to drive out their enemies for them Joshua 23: 5 and 6 if we skip ahead but he said it also before here's what it says Joshua says and the Lord your God he shall thrust them out from before you and he'll drive them from before you and you shall possess their land just as the Lord your God promised you be very firm then to keep and to do all that is written in the book of the law of Moses so that you may not turn aside from it to the right hand or to the left and so they are told God says I will drive out the enemy but here in our text it he's telling them they need to drive out the enemy that's interesting God will drive out the enemy but it's going to happen as they obey the Lord so you say well wait a minute Pastor is it God or is it yes no you didn't hear my question no you didn't hear my answer Paul said I do all things through Christ who strengthens me without God I can't without me he won't you've heard me say it a 100 times you don't lean on a shovel and pray for a hole I hope you don't we're not called they were not eradicate all evil on the planet that was not their mission just to remove and drive out the enemies who had strongholds in their god-given territory Martin Luther once said this he was talking about Temptation he said you cannot stop the birds from flying overhead but you can certainly keep them from nesting in your hair in other words we have a responsibility we have territory you might say in our lives as Believers if we make the analogy that was physical territory where there were enemies that were a threat to them not so much just to destroy them but to cause them to compromise which is what will happen eventually you know the northern kingdom and the southern kingdom are going to go one's going to go into captivity the other one's going to be invaded because of God's judgment because of idolatry children of Israel are are not worshiping Idols at this point the nations are that they don't drive out the history is God's warning them you got to drive them out you'll be sorry if you don't and and of course they would be but in in our lives it's more like this it's our territory where's the enemy in in your life", "where does he have a stronghold in in your life if you want all that God has for you you have a responsibility to say I see where he is and I need him to I need that to be gone that that area of evil that area of compromise it could be your thought life it for most of us it is in one way or another maybe in areas that's why the Bible does say bring every thought into captivity to Christ we need our minds renewed battle for the soul happens in the mind you guys Satan's it's not a power encounter it's a truth encounter you'll know the truth the truth will set you free it's not about I'm going to the devil's button my quoting vers it's not that you need by faith to believe the word of God it's it's in your mind where that exists maybe it's in your family remember Gideon will have to go fight the midianites and lead the nation of Israel against their actual physical enemy but before he can fight them he has to get rid of the idol in his own backyard in his father's on his father's property that was going to cause problems for him they wanted to kill him for doing that this is before he gets to go help anybody else start right where you are what's going on in your family what's going on in your home where does evil have a stronghold maybe it's with your friends things you do that you know you shouldn't do maybe it's with your fears that you have or with your finances I mean there's areas where this enemy has a stronghold you don't believe God you don't trust God or you're God now in the New Testament in Ephesians Paul sayso not give the devil opportunity the actual Greek word literally says don't give the devil a space word opportunity is not there don't give the devil a square inch and then in context it applies it it says don't let the sun go down on anger so so what does that mean well it means if you're upset with somebody if you're angry with somebody um deal with it don't say well Time Heals all wounds that's just a Lie by the way that's not true especially in wounds of the disturbances friendships that have not been mended because you didn't agree about who was right if you're at odds with a friend I I don't really care who was right I don't I I hope you were right I was good but you're not right by not reconciling", "now you can't make that other person accept you and forgive you but if you're waiting for them to recognize they were wrong you're in the wrong you're saying being right is more important than that relationship humble yourself and tell them maybe you're right maybe I'm right I don't know but it doesn't matter what matters just you matter to me I want a relationship with you please forgive me for the way I've been acting you say I can't do that well you can you just don't want to don't give the devil an opportunity don't go to bed angry that's easier said than done see once you start breaking that one you just keep doing it um I I want to encourage you in this area this is talking about anger but the same thing is true with all sin keep just deal with it soon in particular when people have hurt you we are so much still like when we were kids it's they it it's their fault do you know what they said whatever I try to deal with my kids when my grandkids when they're at odds with each other they always only want to tell me what the other person has done do you know what they said earlier do you know what they did did you the look they just gave no we become adults but we still act the same way why should did I have to deal with this I didn't start it it's not my fault it's their fault aren't you glad God doesn't say that you I won't reconcile with him I won't reconcile with her they it's their sin Bible says forgive each other as God has forgiven you you know what that means take the initiative he was reconciling with you before you were born he's always ready to reconcile put this down letter C let obedience create a thirst in your children a thirst verse 20 says this when your son asks you in time to come saying what do the testimonies statutes and judgments the Bible mean which the Lord Our God commanded you you'll say to your son we were slaves to pharoh in Egypt and the Lord brought us up from Egypt with a mighty hand moreover the Lord showed us great and stressing signs and wonders before our eyes against Egypt pharaoh and all of his household and he brought us out from there in order to bring us in to give us the land which he had sworn to our fathers if you're taking notes uh the first one under letter C is the question is do your children wonder", "why in other words um in the New Testament in Peter he says be ready always be ready to give an answer uh for the hope that lies within I don't know if you've ever thought about that um always be ready to give an answer an apologetic really is what it says an apologia in the Greek a reasoned answer always be ready to give an answer for the hope that lies within you but that statement assumes something that there's a hope within you and somebody else can see it they're not going to apologetics is not about you going and arguing with non-christians they should be Christians and atheist should believe in God and trying to convince them with Logic No they're supposed to see something in you that attracts them and says how why do you believe in that why why do you think the Bible's true and why do you think when you die you're going to go to heaven that Jesus was what what makes you think that but they need to see it the hope that lies within you you see and even here it's assumed that our children see the significance of the place of God's word in our lives why what is the Bible to you you clearly read it a lot and you quote it you study it and Mom and Dad what are they asking why because that's true because that's the premise here is that your children can see you really believe this book you don't just value it carry it you you love it put this down have a short version of your testimony ready to share a summary version I mean that's really what he says look he says be ready to tell them what happened in Egypt and how God what God did give them the highlights the cliffnotes version you know I think every Christian should know their testimony I mentioned on Sunday we have a little way if you want record yourself on your no one's doing it but record yourself on your phone send it in so other people can hear your testimony I think it's a good practice even if you don't send it in just what is your testimony when did you get saved how did you get saved who did God use just just share it to remind yourself and to praise God even if nobody else watches it but I think your children should be able to do that can your children tell re rehearse your story not really so I haven't told them the whole story listen you don't have to get into", "the kind of gods you worshiped in Egypt and all the sin you committed back in Egypt no they said we were slaves in Egypt it was miserable was like w was party time it was great that I became a Christian no it was terrible I hated life but God saved me from it you don't have to get a whole bunch into what you did wrong focus on what the Lord did but you got to remember there was a past one verse here it says we are going to tell them what and where we were in the past before we were saved we were slaves and but by God's power he brought us out of our past life and he showed us signs and wonders he revealed himself to us personally not just I believed intellectually then he revealed his plan to bring us out not just to get us out of slavery that would have been enough but no to bring us into this Promised Land maybe for you it's you know what my kids need to know I was an atheist or my they need to know I was into a false religion I was just living a self centered life what whatever your is and then finally put this down tell them how God uses his word in your life today in verse 24 and 25 so the Lord commanded us this is the fathers telling their children or the parents so the Lord commanded us to observe all these statutes to fear the lord Our God for our good always and for our survival as it is today it'll be righteousness for us if we're careful to observe all this commandment before the lord it's one thing for our children to know that we believe the Bible is true I think that's important what the Bible says about God's existence about creation about the return of Jesus about who Jesus was they should know that we believe those facts but this is something more what about what the Bible teaches us about fearing God about having a a right relationship with him about enjoying life to the fullest about surviving that's what he says it's our survival surviving the hardest times the word of God is both true eternally and it should have our reverence we we believe what it says is true but it also is being reflected in the way we we are living Our Lives practically it's the word of God that is giving me this reason for living and this Joy of looking to the Future and understanding when things are terrible I'm going to", "survive I'm going to make it this is this is God's survival manual our children need to understand that not just that we believe that but they see it lived out in our lives and this is what God is saying through Moses make sure your kids see something about the the word to you that they're going why is it that way and then man be ready to tell them your story of what I've done in the past and how the how I'm using my word right now in your life so that's what we're encouraged these are part of the blessings of obedience it gives us the not only a way to make it through life and get ready for heaven but really to affect a whole new generation our kids our grandkids need to see the reality of the Lord in our lives let's to close with this one of the things I share about when I go to Israel on the southern steps um is when Jesus went and cleansed the temple and by the way he cleansed the temple according to the Bible twice at the beginning of his ministry and at the end of his ministry it's very interesting you say well if he cleansed it once why did he have to Cle cleans it a second time do we really need to ask that question our bodies are Temple of the Holy Spirit yeah we need recleaning and repossessing and that's what he did he went said this is my father's house you made it a den of Thieves but it's very interesting after Jesus cleansed the temple the Bible says people started coming to him Not only was he teaching but he was healing people Miracles were happening people that were sick were coming in and coming out well from the presence of Jesus and then it says the children started praising God when they saw the wonderful things that the Messiah was doing it's like this is God's house hey JC is in the house and there's stuff happening in here and they had been to the temple many times I knew it was a wonderful historical place but it was more of a museum and ritual and blood and nothing power of God was happening the shikan and Glory had left a long time ago but suddenly the glory of God was in the temple when Jesus was given his right place there was power coming from the temple folks another generation needs to see the power of God working in our life they will start to praise God you won't have to send them to church they'll", "Chase it down they'll go on their own because they'll want to know your God Amen let's all stand and sing together you're never going to let you're never going to let me down you're you're never going to let you're never going to let me down you're never going to let you're never going to let me down you're never going to let you're never going to let me down you're never going to let you never going to let me down you're never going to let you're never going to let me down you're never going to let you're never going to let me down you're never going to let you're never going to let me down you are good you are good you're good so good you're never going to let you're never going to let me down you're never going to let you're never going to let me down you're never going to let you're never going to let me down you're never that you never that me somebody has said the the Bible maybe bi should stand for basic instructions before leaving Earth that's not bad but maybe as we are studying the word of God the importance of the word of God loving the Lord and having it so be in our hearts that it's affecting everything we do and affecting the people around us and you're saying I I don't really think that's a very accurate description of of my life and maybe you walk out going man I I'm not like that I wish I was more like that listen you can be if you're willing to say Lord I want to be that help me he will give you a love for him and a love for this book and and when that happens it won't be because you felt bad and started working on it it'll be because you allow his holy spirit to give you that desire there's not a person here that in our own flesh is going to master this book or have a love for this book The Way We ought it's a work of God but it's available to anybody so if the I'm just picturing somebody here who's bummed out thanks that was a great message I feel so condemned I'm going home now watch TV uh listen to me don't be bummed out let let this message say this is available if it's not maybe for some of you because I used to be like that in the word I used to be like I love the read I love to be with the Lord but that's a long time ago when", "I was a young Christian I don't know your story I just know mine and I know that I wasn't always in love with the Bible I wasn't always in love with the author of The Bible even as a Christian but if you want all that God has for you if you want all that God wants to give you to start giving you from his word then tell him that you want that but you don't know how to get there guess what Jesus didn't say I'll show you the way he said I am the way he's just waiting for you to say it he'll do the rest God", "speak not even my opinions about what you've spoken the Lord we want to hear thus saith the Lord so speak with authority in jesus name amen you can be so Paul last week for us but last verses that we've studied the first verses of this book is commending this church that's being persecuted for their faith and he commends them first of all he said remember your faith is greatly enlarged so they're growing you said not only that but your love is obviously growing toward each other very individual you're loving individuals you know I think it's great to come together and experience the love of God as the body of Christ but he say hey know that love is being practically lived out toward people in need and then he finished commending them by saying I actually talked to other churches about what I see and or at least what I hear is going on there how though you're suffering you're enduring your persecution we got down Ecclesiastes 7 and verse 8 by the way if too I'm glad you're here we do encourage you to bring your Bibles there are outlines and I will make reference to a scripture it'll usually be on the screen and if you want you can jot down the references and look at them again later or turn to them as you wish but in Ecclesiastes 7 and verse 8 that wisest man in the world actually the wisest fool as well wrote this but it's inspired Scripture he said the end of a matter is better than its beginning the end of a matter is better than its beginning I know people enjoy it when I say amen and they can go home but the end of a matter is better than its beginning and that's kind of why I've entitled this mad at this matter this message in the end because Paul is talking to a church that's growing but suffering and he if you will flashes forward to describe what will happen at the end remember first Thessalonians is written really to the church about the rapture second Thessalonians is written about the return of Christ what we call the parousia the second coming when Jesus Christ comes to the earth to rule and reign for a thousand years and so he will take us in this text to what will happen both for believers and for Christ rejecters in the end but Paul is basically going to say if I could summarize it in the end all your suffering will cease that's revelry 21:4 no longer any morning crying or", "pain the first things have passed away we look forward to that and also your persecutors are gonna be punished which is something that would encourage them to realize this won't go on forever in it's an ignoring and just letting me be ripped off and hurt by other people God's taking note of it and we'll deal with it and in the end the bottom line is God will be glorified so that's what he's gonna teach us but let's get into it first of all in the end this is the fill and put in the word vindication we will see divine vindication and verse 5 talking now let's go back and look at it again I like to read it twice to get the Word of God into our minds this enduring persecution and afflictions is a plain indication or indicator or a token of God's righteous judgment so that you'll be considered worthy of the kingdom of God for which indeed you are suffering put this down it will validate God's use of suffering the end will validate what God's allowing to happen in our lives right now we can't see the valuable effects of our suffering at the time but in the end we will you see there are those who wrongly teach and maybe you've read their books or heard their sermons that all suffering for Christians is a result of sin personal sin or a lack of faith that is just not true biblically jot down 1st Peter 4 and verse 19 listen to what Peter writes by the way he's writing his epistle to suffering Christians he said therefore those also who suffer noticed this according to the will of God okay there is suffering that's not according to will have gotten there is suffering that is according to the will of God when you sin you get a ticket you get arrested you get in trouble soon as its consul that's not suffering according to the will of God that's suffering according to the stupidity of man okay but when we suffer as believers in the center of his will let those who suffer according to the will of God were to entrust our souls to a faithful creator in doing what is right I've told you be for and I'll say it again jesus is our example for everything but in John 13 he says as he washes the feet of the disciples I've given you an example if I as your Lord would wash your feet you should wash one another's feet so he's an example of service Peter says if we", "look at Jesus in his trial when he kept his mouth shut and when he was being abused on righteously he's an example not of serving but an example of suffering and we are called to follow in his steps how did he do it how did he go through that it's hard to keep your when you're being treated wrong it's an old saying it's easier to suffer in silence if you're sure somebody is watching read the book of Acts and watch Stephen who is going to be killed unjustly but he sees Jesus is watching him standing at the right hand of the Father ready to receive him yes when you know God is watching and he is taking it into account you see jesus is our example remember the old saying if I put my hands in my pockets when somebody wants to fight God will take his hands out of his pockets because he says vengeance is mine saith the Lord I will repay but if you take your hands out of your pockets God says okay I'll put mine in my pockets go for it and so we're gonna learn that God is going to allow us to suffer but many times actually it's in the center of his will he is sovereign he could stop it at any time but we see that Jesus Christ becomes our pattern for how to come into the kingdom of God it's not just the Jesus suffered persecution and death but rather he says if you want to follow me then follow me deny yourself take up your cross and follow me you're gonna have to go the same route first the cross and then the crown first the pain and then the gain jot down Romans 8 and verse 17 Paul they're talking about how we're children of God but he says if we're children and as believers were heirs those who will inherit also we're fellow heirs with Christ if indeed we suffer with him so that we might also be glorified with him please don't get the misunderstanding from this text that Paul is like we earn heaven by suffering that is absolutely heresy we don't earn heaven ever and no amount of suffering that you're gonna go through in this life will warrant your going to heaven absolutely not but rather the fact that we're suffering and still trusting God Paul said becomes an indication that God's suffering that he's loud is just he's wise its vindicated what he is doing in a very interesting article about Andrew Jackson who by the way was a man who was a", "and I mean from the time he was young rough guy he lived most of his adult life with two bullets inside of him he was a man who knew physical pain emotional pain but a very interesting guy I mean his wife died not long after right after he was elected president had a lot of hard things in his life but he was a very popular president fact one of the most popular he actually is one of the few presidents who left office more popular than when he began a journalist at his time said for one time the Rising Sun was eclipsed by the setting of the Sun and in a very interesting article about his life swindoll talks about how pain didn't destroy him it developed him into the man that he became as far as his character and he wrote this when Dahl said pain humbles the proud it softens the stubborn it melts the hard silently and relentlessly it wins battles deep within the lonely soul the heart alone knows its own sorrow and not another person can fully share in it pain operates alone it needs no assistance it communicates its own message whether to statesman or servant preacher or prodigal mother or child by staying it refuses to be ignored by hurting it reduces its victim to profound depths of anguish and it is at that anguishing point that the sufferer either submits and learns developing maturity and character or resists and becomes embittered swamped by self-pity smothered by self will and I might add who just lives to blame others I have tried and I cannot find either in Scripture or in history purse that was greatly used of God that he didn't have to first allow to undergo great hurt but this down suffering reveals a confirmation of your salvation a confirmation suffering and enduring it does now you know I think sometimes as Christians we think well as Christians we're not really persecuted for our faith and I would say certainly in comparison to those who are giving their life by the way I think we're so isolated in America we can thank God that were protected in many ways at least for now but there are many who are not there are many who are giving their lives and I don't know if you know this or even realize it's true do you know that in the last hundred years more Christians have died for being Christians than in the nineteen hundred years combined so if you think there is some persecution in our world already and I'm talking about martyrdom you're", "wrong but we do escape a lot of that we think well I've never been persecuted for my faith but actually Jesus in the Gospel of Matthew said blessed are you when men persecute you and insult you maybe you've been insulted maybe you've been called a holy roller or a Jesus Freak or a weirdo because you believed Jesus had blessed her you rejoice for such was the case of the people before you who stood for God maybe our persecutions are small but they're not nothing in God's eyes maybe you like I have lost family members because of your faith or you've lost a friend or you've lost a job as I have but can I say there is nothing I've ever lost that can ever compare with what I've gained I mean it's nothing why talk about it it's nothing compared to what Jesus Christ has given me what did Paul say whatever things were gain to me those I have counted as loss yeah I count all things those lost and count them but rubbish that I may gain Christ so we shouldn't focus on it but the fact is if you're walking with the Lord you will be persecuted to some degree how do I know it it's a promise of God say I don't want to claim that one sorry it's still a promise of God oh that means all who desire to live godly in Christ Jesus shall be persecuted jesus said they hated me if you want to become like me they're gonna hate you too I'm not even close to being like Jesus but to the degree I become like him there will be more opposition and in our dark world it's gonna grow so Paul is writing to Christians who happen to be really suffering losses of jobs perhaps of freedom tough times but Paul says it's actually a confirmation that you're a real believer jot down philippians 1 verses 28 and 29 paul writes that church who are going through persecution and he says don't be alarmed by your opponents that's a sign of destruction for them but of salvation for you and that too is from God maybe you've heard the phrase the perseverance of the saints usually when people have heard that phrase they're studying Reformation theology or the five points of Calvinism tulip etc but the phrase is actually in the scripture the perseverance of the saints it's from the Bible well what does that mean the person it's used twice in the Bible by the way well it's interesting there Jesus is talking about the tribulation where the", "worst trials will come and there will be believers still on the earth I'm not these believers but new believers who will come to faith after the rapture and Jesus says this during that time of Jacob's trouble trouble the worst time the earth will ever know he said but he who endures to the end shall be what saved you should say that out loud they who endured to the end shall be saved why will those who endure to the end shall be saved let me tell you why theologically because those who endure to the end are saved that's why you see John put it this way when he saw some people leave the body of Christ to walk away from the Lord he said they went out from us because they were never really of us had they been of us true believers they would have remained with us but they went out that it might become manifest apparently they were never really of us he didn't mean they wouldn't have the street to a different Church because they had a better worship service he they left the Lord they fell away and one of the evidence they were unwilling to stay with the body of Christ and endure the persecutions remember the seed that son on the rocky soil does not endure persecution so Paul says you going through it and staying with the Lord is evident that you're really a true believer in fact suffering tends to reveal our faith and refine our faith now I'll be honest I'm just like you when things are going bad I wanted to go away don't like it please go on you're big you can do anything still the storm and you know what he can there's nothing wrong with asking God to do so so long as you can also pray the last part of Jesus's prayer when he said if it's possible let this cup pass from me you can pray that all day long just finish it off with nevertheless in other words God and then eunuch ate it well I'll say it I don't really mean it no you got to mean it I want this to pass but if it's not going to I will except in fact I'm asking for I'll celebrate now your will whatever it is because I you have to decide God but what you decide is going to be best so if the suffering stays then I'm gonna remember all your promises in the Bible about why you allow me to suffer what you do through it and ask you to", "accomplish your purpose is put this down number three Christ brings relief when he is revealed verse six Paul says after all it's only just for God to repaid with tribulation literally those who afflict you and to give relief to you who are afflicted and us as well when the Lord Jesus will be revealed from heaven with his mighty angels now divine retribution that's letter B there will be divine retribution I know you just put in the word relief listen this is an interesting word this word relief he says he'll give you relief it's the word that's used of a person pulling like a bowstring under tension who then releases it Paul says God is going to bring you relief when Jesus Christ comes back not a problem I want him to give me relief today this is a true story I read it years ago but I still think it's pretty fascinating according to the Press August 1991 a thief decided to siphon gas from Dennis Quigley's motor home in Seattle Washington Dennis inside the motor home heard a commotion outside and went to investigate he found the thief curled up in a ball on the lawn vomiting violently intending to suck the contents of the gas tank through a hose the thief had accidentally put the hose in the wrong place and sucked up the contents of the sewage tank instead the thief was not prosecuted because Dennis and the police agreed he had suffered enough justice had been meted out you hear a story like that you go yes because it just doesn't usually end that way right now I want to tell you something it's important about this the Bible says God takes no pleasure in the death of the wicked and we're not to rejoice when the wicked experienced that that's that's actually we're not called to do that but there is a sense of relief and confidence of knowing that God is just God is called the God of justice he loves justice what was it Abraham said to the Lord and just concerned about Sodom and Gomorrah will the judge of the whole earth not do what is right can I say you don't have to ever worry about that people who worry about while some are predestined and others aren't so it's God's fault they're going to well the judge of the earth not do what is right listen you have to worry about justice with God if he's not just he's don't worry God's not just just he's gracious and that's undeserved favor well the fact is Paul is writing to encourage them that the Lord will", "ultimately bring about justice those who have unjustly caused you affliction God will justly bring them affliction so there we are in verse 7 about divine retribution now look at how he describes he says when Jesus verse 7 comes back when he's revealed from heaven it's talking about the second coming he won't be revealed from heaven at the rapture the Bible says when he comes in the second coming every eye will see him she said when he returns in the power of the Angels and with with with power and in Greg Laurie yeah that's what sounds like an ax I assume Greg will be there but that's not what he said he returns in the power of his angels and with great and clouds of glory that's the second coming when every eye will see him everyone and the whole earth will see it you won't be able to miss it rapture no one on earth will see it we will see him when we're there but they won't so he's talking here about what's called the parousia or the second coming of Christ and he says Jesus Christ will be revealed from heaven with his mighty angels we know the angels come back with him and with us in the second coming but notice what it says in flaming fire dealing out here it is retribution that is paybacks to those who do not know God and to those who do not obey the gospel of the Lord Jesus and he goes on these will pay the penalty of eternal destruction away from the presence of the Lord and from the glory of his power you know you could write a book about what the Bible has to say about heaven it's just a very very very very very very small book we don't have that much when it comes to the doctrine of Hell there are those who want to pretend it's not even in the book oh but it clearly is and Jesus actually had more to say about Hell than heaven if you read the Gospels so here Paul is gonna touch on a subject very unpopular in our day there are churches and pastors who will not use the word you know they don't even say a Qi double toothpick they just stay away from the whole doctrine of divine judgment they think it's to protect I think God's image because people don't like to hear about judgment now there are those who say and you hear at 92 with all the mass shootings you know think times like 9/11 and tragedies why doesn't God do something about all the", "evil why did they do something about all the evil you know my answer to that is he has it's called the cross of Jesus Christ where the wrath of God was poured out on a son for all the sin that man has committed not only has he done it but he is doing something about it you say how he's recording ever every evil thought and intention of man from the time man was first on this earth from the time they're born till the time you die it's all recorded Jesus and men will give an account for every idle word there is nothing this Billy Graham used to say this in his Crusades he would go the cameras have been rolling since the moment you were born read revelation 20 man when he's judged and condemned not you if you're saved but those who are damned will be judged out of the books that God has kept the records every single thing man has done wrong so God did do something about evil he is doing something about evil by recording it tracking it and by the way also using it in our lines that's what he's talking about in this passage what man does for evil God uses for good he redeems it and he will do that all things are working together for good and then finally he will and that's talking about the time when Jesus Christ comes back and the Bible clearly teaches he will judge the wicked so faith is a gift we're not saved by works and so there's a reward sin is a work and therefore it has a payday the wages of sin is death and if you think about it it's kind of amazing we're gonna be on this earth maybe a hundred years maybe a hundred and ten if you you know eat all the right stuff I guess but for the world for the world the best they'll ever have it is during this short time on earth it's the closest to heaven they'll ever get for the believer it's the closest to Hell will ever get what a difference put this down they refuse to know him or obey the gospel those who are condemned those who are judged are described as they refused to know him or obey the gospel they do not know him now there's a mistake you might make of this place saying God's gonna judge to hell those people who never knew him that's not right that's not fair and that's not what he's saying they say what Stirling's I get will you jot down Roman", "verses 18 through 20 listen to what Paul says there the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men here's why they suppress the truth in unrighteousness then he describes what he means because that which is known about God is evident within them for God made it evident to them then he explains what he means by that for since the creation of the world God's invisible attributes that is his eternal nature and divine power have been clearly seen being understood through what has been made so that they are without excuse what Paul is saying if you read Romans 1 is that in Romans 2 as well is that God will judge mankind based on the light that they had but part of the reality is that all people have a knowledge of God they don't know God relationally but they know there's a God Helen Keller was born blind deaf dumb and mute but as she was taught to communicate someone shared the gospel of Jesus Christ with her it was very interesting what her response to it was she said she communicated I always knew there was a God I just didn't know his name until today here's a person who lacks the senses that most people have God says people are without excuse I am revealing read Psalm 19 the heavens declare the glory of God and the firmament showeth his handiwork day to day ports forth speech and night to night knowledge the evidence that there's a creator is in front of everybody and I'll hold them accountable for it not only that I placed in within their conscience a knowledge of right and wrong which will condemn them without the Bible without the gospel it'll condemn them because they knew what was right and they did wrong according nobody has a right to salvation because I just didn't know when it says that they know not God is talking about willfully not being willing to know God remember what John writes in John 17:3 jesus said it this is eternal life that you may know the only true God and Jesus Christ to me ascent doesn't mean to know about God I grew up knowing all about God believe me the demons know about God they're not no to know him experientially as my Lord to surrender my life to him you see do you know God do you have a relationship with God because it's one of the descriptions of being a saved person but then it says they don't obey the gospel now that's an interesting phrase we hardly ever hear", "that we hear about believing the gospel but obeying the gospel well that suggests there's a command there jot it down acts 17 in verse 30 Paul there in Athens says God overlooked people's ignorance about these things in earlier times but now notice he commands everyone everywhere to repent of their sins and turn to Him in other words before he revealed himself in his son God moved in compassion with people who didn't have him but now that he has sent His Son and revealed himself through Christ who fulfilled the law and was crucified and raised again now he's commanding everyone everywhere to repent of their sins and turned him here's here's the reality then the gospel is more than information to be understood it's an that you must respond to years ago a man who was knighted his name was Sir Leonard Wood was in France he was meeting with the French King and the King was impressed by him and invited him to come to lunch the next day at the palace well the next day Sir Leonard Wood showed up came into the palace and actually ran him to the King in the and the King said what are you doing here he said you invited me he said yeah but you never responded to my invitation he said sir a King's invitation is not to be responded to it's to be obeyed when Jesus Christ invites all men who soever well it's a command to come to him come to me that's a command all who are weary and heavy-laden so they obey not the gospel and then it describes what we would call hell never uses the word hell but it does say this verse 9 they will pay the penalty of eternal destruction away from the presence of the Lord and away from the glory of his power now there's a lot that is written by people and even by Jesus in the Gospels about Hell but may we focus in on the fact that while these descriptions of Hell might help us to some degree to have some fathom how can you burn and not be consumed and you know how how do you be an utter fire for ever and it happened you have fire and that our darkness those things don't seem to go together there's a lot about the descriptions of help we don't completely understand but here we have it in black or white in black and white what it involves is being away from the presence of God I want you to think about that because the best way to understand Hell is probably", "to think a little bit about heaven you say what do you mean well what makes heaven heaven is it the pearly gates is it the golden streets is it the mansions so well those aren't bad no but you would agree with me that what makes heaven heaven is none of those things and by the way if you read your Bible you'll discover that heaven is on earth in the end anyway but I know a lot of people don't just can't imagine that but read the rest of the book of Revelation you'll discover it's here but anyway the New Jerusalem comes down to earth forever anyhow here's the point that I want to make we do understand where heaven is by the way I take people over to what we call the Holy Land right everybody wants to see the Holy Land but do you remember what God said to Moses not in Israel but out in the wilderness of Midian take off your sandals because the place that you're standing is what Lord we got a little piece of the Holy Land here yeah wherever God is wherever he says it's holy is holy we need to get Psalm 16:11 puts it this way in his presence fullness of joy at his right hand are pleasures forevermore it's not about the place it's about the person it's about being with the right person that's what makes heaven have and so we can easily see what makes hell hell it's not about the temperature it's not about how hot it is it's about how far away it is from God's presence it's not about utter darkness it's about the other distance from the presence of a holy loving Almighty God that's what makes Hell hell so I conclude this and I wrote this down if in his presence is eternal fullness away from his presence must be eternal emptiness if in his presence is eternal joy then away from his presence is eternal sorrow if in his presence is eternal pleasure than away from his presence is eternal pain if in his presence is eternal relief then away from his presence must be eternal regret and so please keep in mind while we can't physically describe spiritual torment in eternity though the Bible clearly teaches it and to do anything less is to do despite to the Bible those who claim well I don't believe it's forever I think everybody's all totally gonna be saying you can say that all you want but if the Scriptures do not line up with that it's hard for us to understand the reality so I know a lot", "of people don't like this doctrine it's just Lewis said if I could take one doctrine of Christianity you'd be hell but I can't because it's in there and it's clear black and white when it comes down to it there are only two kind of people in this room in the end on the earth CS Lewis said this he said there are two kind of people in the end those who say to God thy will be done and those to whom God says in the end that I will be done all that are in hell choose Spurgeon used to say in heaven are the whosoever wills and those in hell are the whosoever wants in other words you may not like the doctrine of hell in fact I hear people say well I don't believe in Hell okay you're free to not believe in it but can I ask you do you think not believing in something makes it not true obviously that's ridiculous I'm a I had liked one of my little hobbies is to save last words of people things that people said that are interesting or curious one of those was a general his name is general Sedgwick John Sedgwick of the inn during the Civil War and he was trying to rally his troops to fight the enemy but he thought the enemy was so far away they weren't a threat and they were all kind of hiding behind this parapet and last words of John John Sedgwick were come come now men they couldn't hit an elephant from this disk yeah the rest of the story you can kind of imagine just because you don't believe something is true does not make it not true so you say I don't like that doctrine and and I hear people say well I don't believe in a God who would send anyone to hell and I answer that by saying me I don't believe in a God who would send anyone to hell but I do believe a person can send themself there remember what Jesus said hell was created for the devil's and his angels never created for man the Bible says God's not willing that any would perish but that all would come to eternal life to go to hell you have to say no to God's love to God's grace to God's will to God's Word to God's son and to God's Spirit repeatedly your whole life no no a million times no and then God will honor your request because in the end it's very clear according to the Bible there's only two kind of people that are", "the Saints and the aints I read Matthew 25 when he comes back he's gonna gather the nation's as a shepherd gathers his sheep and goats and he'll separate them some going into eternal the kingdom of God inherit the kingdom of your father prepared before the foundation law and others will go into eternal destruction only - there's only sheep and there's goats I there is no such thing as a GEEP I have preached this and have people come up to me I'm a gay it's like you're not you're a fool for saying it but anyway don't tell me you're a geek because it does not exist in Matthew 25 regardless of what crazy scientists tried to do with animals I'll never reproduce because they are not a species Saints a Nate's sheep and goats in the Lamb's Book of Life it's black and white your name is either clearly delineated or tragically deleted and the choice is the bottom line I love the story about Calvin Coolidge you know Calvin Coolidge was he was president but he was vice president first and he served as the vice president you serve as the president of the Senate it's your job to oversee the Senate and I one occasion cool Cal he just was a man of very few words but he would he was sitting there watching the proceedings and two senators got into it with each other and were arguing and offending each other and finally one of the senators said to them well you can just go straight right out and the other guy the guy who said that too was extremely offended went up to him to say hey did you hear what he just said and Calvin was looking at a book and he goes you know I've been looking through the book the rule book and you don't have to go can I tell you I've looked through the rule book and you do not have to go I remember in the 60s there were anti Vietnam war protesters with their pickets and there's chants and they would say hell no we won't go talking about the draft I thought you know that if you just put a comma after the word hell we could have a Christian bumper sticker on that one hell no we you don't have to go to hell but don't think it's going to go away simply because it's not popular put this down let her see we will witness divine exaltation we will witness divine exaltation in verse 10 he talks about Christ's second coming he says he's coming to be glorified in his Saints on", "that day and to be marveled at among all who have believed you know you read through the Gospels and you what you repeatedly read jesus heals the paralytic and men marvel jesus stills the storm and the disciples marvel jesus teaches and the people are you know that word marvel is used all through the Paul says well there's a coming a day when all believers are just gonna go what see I don't think we fully appreciate John says we don't yet know what will be we know that we see him we're gonna appear as him it's talking about the revelation this is the word that Paul uses in Romans 8 the revelation of the sons of God what does that mean the revelation well right now we just kind of look like ordinary folk but God says oh you got real blood in you you're Christian you're a king and you're a priest and you're gonna rule and reign with them you don't you just kinda look like me just ordinary me yep just looking nobody knows what God knows about you you see because you're in Christ he has plans for you and not only that when he glorifies you was just what Paul was talking in Romans 8 you're gonna look a little different it's on the plus side see Paul says that the entire creation the world and the universe were subjected to futility by God was that mean it means that when man sinned he didn't just affect himself and his wife and his kids or us it affected the entire creation infected the entire creation sin and its effects well we sometimes call the third or second law of thermodynamics the unwinding of everything that's built into this universe sin infected everything but God is going to redeem this universe not just me and you but everything in it and Paul says it's waiting the creation Long's like with child birthing pains to be set free from its corruption and when is it going to happen when God reveals the sons of God when you and I are glorified at the rapture and then it's a second coming when the world and the angels see us here's what God said it's like they go tada look at what I've done and at that point it's gonna be we're gonna marvel at him and people are gonna marvel it that's Bob Copa knee you don't look anything like you used to you know you two thumbs up Lord you did okay on him you know put this down see why God will be glorified then see why he'll be glorified verse 10", "now he says he'll be glorified in his Saints it's not just my new body in your new body though or our positions of authority we need to see where the glory comes to God jot it down 1st Corinthians 1 verses 27 through 29 Paul is writing to the church at Corinth and he says God has chosen the foolish things of the world so that he might shame the wise he's chosen weak things of the world to shame the things that are strong and the base things of the world the despised God has chosen the things that are not so that he might nullify the things that are so that no man may boast before God every believer every one of us in this room is a trophy of God but let's not forget what the Bible actually says we are a trophy listen to me of God's grace you say I like that well think about it do you understand what you're saying when you're saying you're a trophy of Ephesians 1:6 says we're to remember we're to live to the praise of the glory of His grace which he'd bestowed on us in the beloved in other words we weren't worthy of honor when he calls us a trophy it's like wow I used to have trophies when I was a kid of my bowling you know a little gold guy it's amazing you know high score high average tries hard not that good most gutters whatever I had a whole line of trophies but it was for something I did right no no being a trophy of grace isn't about what I've done right it's about what he did that I didn't deserve I was the last person in the world that deserved to be in the kingdom you see I'm a trophy of how gracious God is jot it down 1st Timothy 1 verses 13 through 16 listen to what Paul says even though I was formerly before he was saved I was a blasphemer he was a he was a Pharisee he believed in God he would have never blasted even God scream God's son he just didn't know he was God's Son I was a persecutor and a violent aggressor yet I was shown mercy because I acted ignorantly in unbelief notice and the grace of our Lord was more than abundant with the faith and the love which are found in Christ Jesus it is a trustworthy statement deserving full acceptance that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners hey I'm foremost I'm chief of them all yet for this reason because I'm just big", "sinner I found mercy so that in me as the foremost number one Jesus Christ might demonstrate his perfect patience as an example to those who would believe in him for eternal life do you hear what Paul is saying he saved me to tell everyone else there's hope for you because if he can save me you're not as bad as me do you hear what he's saying I was the worst and God poured out his grace on me put this down number two know how God is glorified now know how God is glorified now look at verse 11 and 12 to this end also we pray for you always what's Paul praying for this church that God would count you worthy of your calling what does that mean it means that you would live up to your calling as a believer in Christ that you would live above the line of compromise is what he's talking about and I'm praying that God he is the subject of the sentence will fulfill every desire their desire for goodness and fulfilled the work of faith with power so that the name of our Lord Jesus will be glorified in you and you in him now he says a lot there but let's understand what he is saying he is saying I am praying that you would live the life righteously but also that God would be able to fulfill every desire that you have for goodness that he would be able to fulfill every act of faith with power and here's what he's really saying I'm praying that the desires of your heart and your prayers basically would be a reflection of God's heart so that he could fulfill them you know most of us know that great verse in Psalm 37 verse 4 is one of the first ones I think I memorized when I first heard it was amazing delight yourself in the Lord and he will give you what the desires of your heart and I just remember going wow there's some magic formula here in the Bible I know what the desires of my heart are you know is probably some girlfriend at that age you know or something I wanted to have buy some motorcycle I know the desires of my heart so let's see what's that first part I got to get worked on here delighting myself Lord okay delighting Lord you're all that's good praise you praise you praise you waiting for the desires of my heart to come through and when it didn't work I thought well I've got that verse I don't know I'm trying but along the way", "somewhere I've learned and maybe you have to that it's not that at all it's not a prescription for how to get God to give you what you want it's talking about this the first part of the verse is the key put your delight in the Lord find your fulfillment in him and guess what'll happen here's what will happen he will give you desires he will act the Bible says he's at work within us both to will and to do his good pleasure when you delight in him and you make him your all he'll create desires in you that you think are yours and it'll affect your prayer life you don't want on the coolest things to do is to wake up one day and when you're praying to realize everything you're asking God to do you know is the will of God you're praying for people's salvation you're praying for marriages to come back you're praying for prodigals oh come on you want Lord this is all that I want and you realize God you're creating desires in me that I know are consistent with your will and you've said if I ask anything according to your will you hear me and it'll be done oh man Paul says I am praying that God will fulfill every desire for goodness because that would be his desire every work of faith you see with power because God wants to do a work through your life and when that happens God is glorified right now not just when Christ returns but don't miss the last phrase because I know some of you closed your Bible I forgive you so that the name of our Lord Jesus will be glorified in you and you and him according to the grace of our God and the Lord Jesus Christ please get this whole picture I want God to be glorified but it's gonna be according to His grace you know David is the one in the some who said oh magnify the Lord with me let us exalt his name together I sought the Lord and he heard me and delivered me from all my fears but we are told when he wrote that why he wrote it when did he say that he said it at a very low point in his life let me give you the background Saul wants to kill David David is running for his life but Saul has the whole army of Israel after him you're in trouble APB you know Amber Alert I mean it's a problem you know they got your donkeys license plate you got to get out of town", "so where does it David go he goes across enemy lines into gas gas is run by the Philistines nanny nanny nanny yeah I'm okay help me over here he's safe with the enemy now God didn't send him there he just went there on his own only problem is some the Philistines go who is that guy isn't that the kid that killed our member kalaiy ah--this from oh yeah same town oh yeah and it causes a problem suddenly david\u00eds and safe at all they want him dead they bring him to the king david has to think superfast is like well how many get out of this I didn't expect this so he pretends he's like 5150 unable to care for himself as one of those three anyway he drools into his beard he acts like a bad man he's scrolling graffiti on the walls and the King says we've got enough nut jobs here in Gath get to take that guy out and so they throw they they give the right foot of fellowship to David kick him out of town in shame and he with his tail between his legs makes his way back to the cave of a deulim where God has protected him where he sees that God has given him this place of safety and he says you are my refuge in other words the lowest point of my life when I didn't trust God becomes an opportunity for God to magnify himself listen to me if you're gonna glorify God you can use your gifts for the Lord and you should I want to bring maximum glory to God by the gifts of God that he's given me but that's not what the way I'm gonna bring him the maximum glory it's gonna be by the grace that he's given to me you think that you've blown it so bad God could never use you can I tell you something Jesus already died for the sin that you've committed it's no surprise to him and he wants to use it worse ended about and graced it all the more about why then we might bring glory to the God who is gracious let's bow in prayer father I thank you that you give us insights in this text about what's going to happen in the end and Lord your intention clearly is that we would see the end from now and live now in light of what you said Lord we can hang on if we're suffering if we know you're watching we can trust you that you're working things if you choose not to take the struggle", "the pressure the problem the people out of our life that we would want out because you're taking note of what they're doing to us and you're using it to help us trust you more so help us father to trust you even like David didn't Lord even when we don't would you help us to see that you're gonna be more glorified when we receive grace then using your gifts to the max use it all for your glory and honor Jesus through our lives we pray in Jesus name Amen let's all stand sing together", "in our gymnasium all right enough on that open your Bibles to the Book of Numbers Chapter 28. last week we looked at a couple of things that were unrelated but put into one chapter that had to do with death and we talked about the effect of inheritance and how these five daughters as a low of fad said we don't have an inheritance and kind of an equal rights amendment we want you know we want you to consider us fascinating to me because women were considered property in the ancient world and yet we see in the Bible not only did they do this but they weren't reprimanded for doing this Moses said I don't really know what to do here he's been leading the nation of Israel for 40 years it's in fact the rest of the chapter is about it's his time to die so he's at the end of his 120 years you couldn't get a more a man is more intimate with the Lord who knows the Bible better he's been giving it the word of God that they had and yet he says I need to talk to the Lord I talk about humility I I don't really know it's good when you say to somebody I know what I think but I think I should talk to the Lord about it I used to say that my kids can we do such and such and I'd say well I I when you need to know right now right now well if you need to know right now the answer is no what yeah give me some time to pray about it maybe the answer will be something else but I don't know so it's important that this last chapter was very interesting to me on the succession of Moses with Joshua and now chapter 28 kind of reads like Exodus and Leviticus in some ways because it talks about things we have talked about before but whenever you see something that doesn't make sense like why are we reading it again there's always a reason so beginning in verse 1 of chapter 20 and then the Lord spoke to Moses saying this command the sons of Israel say to them you shall be careful to me at the appointed time you shall say to them to the congregation this is the to the Lord to male Lambs one year old without defect as a continual burnt one lamb in the morning and the other lamb you shall offer at Twilight also a tenth of an IFA a fine flower for a hen of beaten oil it's a continual burnt", "Sinai that was 40 years earlier as a fourth of a Hymn for each lamb in the Holy place you shall pour out a drink other lamb you shall offer it at morning and as its drink offer you shall Aroma to the Lord verse 9. then on Shabbat on the Sabbath day two male Lambs one year old without defect two-tenths of an IFA a fine flower mixed Every Day verse 11 we're only going through verse 15. you you can make it then at the beginning of each of your months you shall present a burnt seven male lambs and a partridge and I'm just kidding one year old without defect and three tens of an IFA a fine flower each Bowl two tents of fine flour mixed one ramp and a tenth of an IFA a fine flower mixed with oil for a grain hint of wine for a ball this is like a recipe and a third of a hen for the RAM and a fourth of a hen for a lamb this is throughout the months of the year and then verse 15 and one male goat for a father there's a lot of stuff in here and every part of it in some way tells us something about our Lord and savior tells us something about ourselves and about our relationship with you so would you bring yourself through this into our eyes open our eyes Lord to see not only why it's here why it's here for us what do we need to take away from this tonight encourage us as we grow in our relationship with you help us to fall deeper in love with you thank you that you don't have to fall any deeper in love with us you've already you you'll always love us as much as you ever can and that's encouraging Lord so now help us to grow in our love for you in Jesus name amen amen you can be seated well I've entitled the message now is the time to worship and I've done that because sometimes we can forget and if you've been around you know that I've talked about this from time to time especially as we studied the books of Exodus and Leviticus I'll say you know when people ask what is the songbook of the Old Testament most I'm sorry what is the worship book of the Old Testament most people say the book of Psalms and I said no the worship book of the Old Testament is actually the Book of Leviticus because the book of Psalms is the song book of the Old Testament it's", "not the worship book we get those kind of confused because we think singing is worship it never is has been uh all that worship is if all worship is to you is a singing you have not yet come to understand worship no The Book of Leviticus is the book of worship in the Old Testament because if you've read Leviticus and if you've studied it with us the very beginning chapters talk about the various sacrifices the sacrifices that God required in order to come into His presence sacrifice and worship go together in the life of a Believer even though we might feel like well we don't do those things anymore that's just something for the Old Testament actually that's not true that sacrifices are only for the Old Testament we'll talk about that but here God is bringing to his people something that we've already studied so put this down God repeats himself and when he does it's always for put it in a good reason when God repeats itself himself it's always for a good reason we kind of have a rerun in this chapter of some of the sacrifices that God had given instructions about in Exodus and Leviticus and we need to ask ourselves is he doing that you know um from time my wife will tell me that I've already told her something now I've noticed it's happening more hoping she can get help with that fact is there are times I forget there are sometimes I'll be honest with you on second service I don't know why this happened well I do it's because it's second service on Sunday morning I'll be in the middle of a message and I'll be thinking about something I'm about to say and then I'll say to myself did I already say this because I said it an hour and a half or did I also say it in this message a couple of minutes ago and I'm thinking if I go tell this story again people are going to look at me like he just said it God doesn't have that problem he's not going I gotta say something here to fill the rest of the book it's a little too short with put some there's no filler in the Bible put this down every new generation must be instructed or reinstructed In Worship you have a brand new generation that's going into the promised land that other generation has died off God gave those instruction to a previous generation he says Moses let's go through it again so this generation is taught remember parents are told fathers are to bring", "their children up in the fear and the admonition or some translations the instruction of the Lord God said there in Deuteronomy 6 you fathers are to teach your children the things that I'm teaching you the law that I've given you teach them to your children talk of them when you walk by the way when you rise up when you lie down look you know we kind of take things for granted many times that everybody should just know things by osmosis and sometimes we do that with children sometimes we do that with each other I remember I I hired my first assistant pastor years ago and he came in for his assignment and there was we had a building and there were some problems down in the children's ministry there was a light switch that wasn't working and had broken they what the lights wouldn't go on and we knew it was the switch and I just said Joe I want you to put in a new light switch and he said that was one of the 20 things I gave him to do and at the end he goes okay and he said uh uh how do you do that and I said how do you put in a light it's two screws two are and then I I mean I felt like a little embarrassed because I realized you know what I wonder if my sons know how to put in a I mean they were you know in their teens and I thought why would they why do I know how to put a Delights because somebody taught me how to do it and we just kind of assume everybody knows how to do this no we all have to be taught Fire's hot don't touch it guns are dangerous be careful how you use them yeah baby taught how to bowl right you could I mean you can throw it however you want you want to throw it like Fred Flintstone you can but I mean you know shake hands with the head pin you know don't go across the foul line if you're playing League because then it's zero you you have somebody has to teach you that at some point we need to teach our kids how to pray we need to teach our kids how to worship God why we worship God and God's saying I want you to give instructions yes Moses you know how to do this but they don't and it's their turn it's you're about to say tag I'm leaving you're staying give the instructions to this new generation put this down", "sacrifice is God's call to consecration to concentration consecration which means to completely surrender yourself and dedicate yourself to God now put this down we need to see in this issue of sacrifice and worship what satisfies the Lord in verse 1 and 2 go back with me to the first couple verses the Lord spoke to Moses saying command the sons of Israel say to them you shall be careful you my food this is how God sees the sacrifice it's my food for my offerings by fire notice this phrase of a soothing Aroma to me at their appointed time my food my soothing King James says my interesting to me God says this is how I feel about the sacrifice that's how I feel about worship it's my food it's something that satisfies me I like the smell of it you know I was here on Saturday speaking I had the privilege of speaking to the couple other folks that came to the love life conference and I walked out of the courtyard met some people and I didn't realize they were having such a good lunch they were making tri-tip they were our guys were barbecuing tri-tip I thought I want to stay I couldn't stay but uh oh man it smelled good God says I love worship I it's like this wafting you know he speaks a prayer like sweet incense when we pray the Lord says it's like sweet incense to me but put this down God wants the flesh to be sacrificed now that's interesting to me why would God call this a sweet smell well it wasn't exactly a barbecue guys in fact have you ever smelled and some of you have and many of you can thank God you haven't have you ever smelled what hide and fur of a bull or a cow or a horse smells like when it's burned they call them rendering plants we don't have many of them around here but when I go to Cuba there's one not far from where Richard Pastor Richard lives you always know when it's working it is one of it's the smell of death it smells like Rotting Flesh it is absolutely horrible and what you need to see here is that God is saying your sacrifice to me that is pleasing to me very interesting the death the flesh jot down Romans 8 verses 6 through 8. for the mindset on the flesh Paul said is death but the mindset on the spirit is life and peace because the mindset on the flesh is hostile toward God can't subject itself to the law of God it's", "not even able to do so and those who are in the flesh cannot please God they do not please God on the last slide and so very interesting to please the Lord we have to deal with the flesh now we're remember what is the distinctive about remember it's just what makes it just yeah what were you gonna say the same thing over here it all gets burned as opposed to cooking it and and literally eating some of it a lot of the sacrifices the other sacrifices were designed to be an expression of Fellowship God's eating the part that we're burning for him and I'm eating with him the priest would eat and the offer would eat it was Fellowship studying In this passage other than that completely incinerated to the Lord It's the Hebrew word Olam or Ola o-l-a-h and if if you know a little bit about uh Hebrew it's related to the word to go up okay and the idea is it's going up in smoke all of it is being incinerated and destroyed there's nothing left of it because God is accepting all of it and the idea is one hundred percent surrender to God this is what God is the sacrifice of the flesh he takes pleasure in that and our complete 100 percent giving ourselves to him that's what's acceptable put this down letter B know when God is saying it's time to worship now of course it's always time to honor God but in the text there are some lessons for us because there are three times that God will go over with his people on the calendar if you sacrifice so put this down first of all there's a daily dedication which must be that's found in Verses 3 through 8 and the second half of verse three take a look at it we'll start at verse just the beginning you shall say to them verse you shall offer to the Lord notice two male Lambs one year old without defect day in verse 4 points out when in the day you shall offer the one lamb in the morning and the other lamb you shall offer in the evening or as as nighttime is coming or the start of a new day in the Jewish Reckoning very interesting basically the thought is this you're going to start and end your day with the lamb you're going to start and end your day with the slain lamb and then it's really an interesting thing the Lamb of course is a picture of Christ it's the lamb without defect which points to his", "the fine flower remember the flower the fine flower that's being offered to God is a picture of Christ's righteousness anybody grow up when I did when the flower that you got you had to sift it do you remember sifters and why am I doing this people that don't know sifting don't have a clue I'm doing because I don't think you buy that anymore do you I don't know why you would but in the Day flower had to be sifted because there are lumps and stuff in there and you want to get that junk out right and so the sifting um remember Jesus said of Peter Satan has desired to sift you like wheat in other words there's some chaff that needs to be dealt with but Jesus Christ in his trials there was nothing but righteousness in his life and then you added to that in the in the sacrifice of the beaten oil now the beaten oil does not speak actually of oil that comes from an oil mill but from a mortar and it was considered not a more like a gun but it was considered the very best grade of oil the highest grade that was used by the way in the Tabernacle for the light that represented the Lord pure oil which of course represents that Spirit-filled life of Jesus Christ who said I am the lion and then there is this pouring out of this libation before the Lord jot down Isaiah 53 and verse 12 where we read this concerning Christ in his suffering and sacrifice therefore God said I'll allot him a portion with the rate and he'll divide the booty with the strong because he poured out himself to death and was numbered with the transgressors yet he himself bore the sin of many and interceded for the transgressor so the sacrifices that we see here are a type or a preview if you will in every respect of the person of the Lord Jesus Christ who would come and make us acceptable to God we come to God on the basis of Christ's sacrifice nothing else nothing else but they're also a picture of our own dedication and so put this down they're a fresh full Daily surrender now jot down first Peter 2 and verse 5 when we talk about sacrifices we think Old Testament but you need to think New Testament why Peter said this Believers we are living stones we're being built up as a spiritual Temple or a spiritual house for a holy priesthood to offer up what which are acceptable to God through so let's begin this idea Lord", "I want to know how I can come to you when should I come to you well every come with the lamb come with what Christ has done for you start the day though with a death there has to be a death not just his Jesus is going to go to the Cross we talked about this the other day but he said if you want to follow me let every man who wants to follow me do what take up and in Luke he said you need to do it daily Paul said First Corinthians 15 I Die daily so did you yet so I don't think so you know next time you're believing spouse is grumpy say did you die yet because that's the problem no but you're about to okay they get upset it's proof they didn't jot down Romans 12 and verse 1. here's what Paul said about this worship and this sacrifice he said I urge you therefore and by the way chapter 12 verse 1 is the application part of the book of Romans everything that Christ has done for you in chapters 1 through 11 gets you ready for now what do I do but you've told me what the Lord has done for me now what do I do I urge you therefore on the basis of whatever you just talked about Brethren by the mercy of God present your bodies a living and which is acceptable to God which is your spiritual service of dedication consecration surrender to the Lord so there's nothing left that I'm holding on to now some of you may remember this I've shared it sometime in the past um back in the 15th century there was a of Russia who is known as Ivan the Great and he was so busy running the Russian he didn't have time to find a wife maybe some of you can relate to I don't know and that's too busy if you ask me but anyway so his friends told them you need to have an error in case you die and so you need to get a wife and so there was arrangements made for him to marry the daughter of the king of Greece this really happened in history however while that the king of Greece agreed to let his daughter marry the czars to Ivan guy there was one condition and that condition was he had to become a member of the Greek Orthodox which he quickly agreed to after I think he saw a picture of her or something he's a pretty lady and uh one of the", "things though to become a member of the Greek Orthodox church is he also had to that's how they accepted membership so 500 Soldiers with the Czar and all of to baptize because the soldiers of the Czar said we are going to join the so he had 500 soldiers and 500 priests the priest were all dressed in black all down like picture at Pirate's Cove just like we did holy they were you know they had their own uniforms and uh a problem were dressed in their armor with their and the priest said you can't be baptized if you're a fighting Soldier you have to give up Warfare and the soldier said we can't give up Warfare we're the king soldiers and so there was a stalemate down at the baptism for trying to figure out the people talking back and forth and I don't know they finally figured it out here's what we're gonna do you soldiers are going to be baptized but when you go down in the water before you do take out your sword and this is a picture of it right that's me right there no keep your sword out of the water everything else but your hand with the sword gets baptized because that way you can go killing people with your sword later we'll let you off the hook because you never baptize that sword that really happened that was their solution somebody made a cartoon after that obviously not the 15th century we could put that up there if we can show it when I baptize you everything that goes under belongs to God so he has his wallet and his money up the joke has been kind of like what's in your wallet what's in your when you dedicated your life completely to the Lord when you got baptized by the Holy Spirit into the church when God really took you and you gave yourself did you leave something out did you leave your thought life did you leave what you do at work like it doesn't matter how I am there it only matters how I am outside of my job did you leave the things that you entertain yourself with what was it for that guy's finances well is there some the point is this if we're going to Worship the Lord it's going to be a hundred percent that's the only kind of sacrifice God will accept there are no compromises well that's for me I'm going to hang on to that that's that one closet that one area I won't give to God but for too many people it", "is a fresh full surrender and then put this down make a daily sacrifice and put two things in here of praise because the Bible is very clear that those are considered sacrifices to the Lord did you know that we're to offer spiritual sacrifice dedication of our whole life but also praise and thanksgiving jot down Psalm 113 and verse 3. listen to this from the rising of the sun this is the morning until the time that it goes down by the way this is quoted in Malachi as well from the rising of the sun till it's setting the name of the Lord is to be praised then Hebrews 13 15 New Testament about sacrifices through him that is Christ then let us continually all through the day offer up a sacrifice of praise to God that is the fruit of our lips that give thanks to his name so at the start of the day should start your day thanking God you say well what should I thank him for well for all the good gifts that he's given you if you don't really have a list of your own just you can borrow mine because I borrow David's that's Psalm 103. he starts talking about Bless the Lord O My Soul by the way he talks to himself if you ever talk to yourself say David did it it's okay did I do it bless the Lord O my soul is giving himself an instruction right that all that is within me bless His holy name bless the Lord O my soul and forget none of his benefits then he gives a list he pardons all your iniquities he heals all your diseases is redeemed your life from the pit you know what I do each morning I think about the times that I was in the pit those aren't pleasant thoughts but I think about how he got me out of there God knows how to get you maybe you're in a pit can I have good news for you the Lord the Lord knows the pit maneuver he knows how to get you out and he's done it many times in my life I just I'm thankful I hope I don't have to have him do it again but he probably will the Lord our God is a god of deliverances plural of the psalmist says he'll get you out he crowns you with loving kindness and compassion by the way those are his character qualities that he makes you shows you're the his child you're the son or daughter of the king that you are", "the very care that's the fruit of the spirit you see being lived out by you and me loving kindness and compassion and he satisfies our years with good things so that our youth is renewed like I was telling somebody recently I believe you know we should try to be as healthy as we can till the day we die I want to die healthy he said that's how I'm weird you're gonna be hit by a truck no I mean I want to go out as healthy as I can the Bible says Moses was 120. he still had vision I don't just mean it's you know I mean I think it was this physical Vision but I think it's spiritual we should have and it says his Vigor had not abated so Melissa our Vigor abated a long time Caleb was 85 and he was taken on the enemy and taking ground at 85. said I'm just as strong as it is I was 40 years ago just been waiting to go take on the enemy that's a that's not just something to read about that's something to realize God wants us to have energy for him to do what he wants us to do right to the end I think that's our model but to say Lord you satisfied my years with good things I'm not just satisfied but you renew me you give me like when I was young when I wanted to go take on new challenges well Psalm 92 verses 1 and 2 talks about this Thanksgiving and faithfulness it's good to give thanks to the Lord and to sing praises to the name almost high to declare thy loving kindness the word is in Hebrew it's the same meaning as Grace in the New Testament loving or Tender Mercies thy loving kindness in the morning remember his mercies are new every morning and thy faithfulness now that it's called here in Hebrews 13 15 a sacrifice of praise should tell us it won't always flow naturally from our you say that again it's a sacrifice of praise other times you say oh praise God I'm so excited about and there's other times you aren't saying anything like you'd be you don't you're not most of us in the morning don't feel haven't had a cup of coffee you know I'm not really ready to I can't think right you know and I'm I'm just it's taking longer to wake up I'm kind of convinced that old age is getting us ready for being in the Lord's presence it's like we're sleeping it's like the Lord says sleep is kind of", "like what a Christian does they don't die they sleep so at some point we just go why does this just to keep me just keep me asleep I'm just enjoying this so much you know I don't know but um the sacrifice of praise tells me it won't always flow naturally jot down habakkuk 3 16-19 this is a great passage if you've never read Heinz feed on high places by Hannah hernard I highly commend it to you but anyway here's what habakkuk the prophet said concerning the invasion of the Babylonians which he couldn't understand how God could use a wicked people like the Babylonians to come and invade his own people but at the end of the book here's what he here's what he says I heard referring to this Invasion and my inward Parts trembled in other words I have dread and the sound of my lips they quivered Decay enters my bones this is this feeling of I hate what is going to happen and in my place I tremble because I must wait quietly for the day of distress for the people to arise who will invade and then he says it this way though the that's the national symbol of Israel by the way though the Fig Tree should not blossom and there'd be no fruit on the though the yield of the olives should fail and the fields produce no food though the flock should be cut off from no cattle in the Stalls yet I will exult in the Lord I will rejoice in the god of my salvation the Lord God is my strength and he has made my feet like Heinz feet and he makes me walk on the high places listen they're in the book of Zechariah Heaven's troubles building the Temple the second temple after the Babylonians destroyed it and the rubble Bulls come back and they're trying to rebuild the Temple and they're having all kinds of difficulties and God says this mountain when he says a mountain he's not talking about a physical Mountain talking about the obstacle a mountain in if you have faith of a mustard seed a mountain will be removed it's not talking about a physical Mountain we're not supposed to go around like vavum moving Earth moving that's not what it's about Jesus never did that what does it talk about it's talking about impossible this mountain will be removed God says not by might nor by power but by my spirit saith the Lord of hosts you can't get this done but I can there's nothing too difficult for me that's true we can", "be encouraged if there's something too difficult for us it's not too difficult for him amen however don't forget habakkuk there will be times you're going to come to a mountain that you're saying God I can't move this you're going to need to move it he's going actually I'm not moving this one I'm giving you new feet I'm giving you Heinz feet that's what the feet of the goats now if you've been some of you been with us to engetti where there's these goats that literally can go up the side of a sheer Cliff we find goats in treason and Getty they climb up in the tree I mean way up in the trees to eat it's a bizarre they have the ability because God gave them these hooves that can handle stuff that you and I could never handle habakkuk is saying if things don't go the way that I had hoped and there looks like they're not God's not taking the Babylonians away what he's going to do is give me the ability to climb up over this mountain and go over the other side so keep that in mind that there's reason to praise him even in the hardest of times as the idea job what did he do on the worst day of his life remember the worst day of his life mostly most of you know he lost his I'm sorry nothing else he lost and he lost everything else compared to that day which was the same day he lost servants and he lost his wealth and his and then he lost his health but on that day when he lost everything he blessed the Lord he didn't have to nobody said why don't you act like Joan he was the one that the story's written about nobody had done that the lord gave was that mean their births 10 of them their births I remember when they were born he's celebrating their birthdays the and now the Lord has appointed when their lives should end it was way sooner than I thought no parent wants to bury but the Lord has taken away I don't understand it I don't want it but I can trust him they lived their whole life person the name the character of God he worshiped the Lord on the worst day at the worst moment of his life what did David do on the worst day of his life if you're not sure what that was that was when his son died a son that he bore with Bathsheba God took that little boy he prayed he fasted he begged his servants thought", "he's going to kill himself if God doesn't heal his son and then word came that the boy the little one-year-old child had died and they did not want to he almost was killing himself when he was that sick what's he going to do when he hears that the child is dead second Samuel 12 20. here's what he did so David when he heard he arose from the he washed anointed himself changed his clothes came into the house of the Lord and he worshiped they thought he would commit suicide at that point he realized there's nothing left to pray for God has made his decision I need to accept it I need to serve in my pain in my heart the worst moment of my life I will worship you need to see what you do routinely is what you will still do in times of don't think you're going to just jump into God's presence if that's not a place you're used to going you probably won't when Daniel realized that a law had been signed that meant if he continued to pray to his God he would be executed and it was only a law that was passed in order to get him executed we know what he did Daniel 6 10. if you want to write it down it's a great verse now when Daniel knew that the document the law was signed he entered his house now in his roof Chambers he had windows open towards Jerusalem and he continued kneeling on his knees three times a day praying and giving thanks before his God as he had been doing previously do you have a regular time to thank the Lord in the morning I'm not going to tell you where you need to do it and how long it needs to be but man this scripture is telling us worship God's surrender yourself daily to the Lord and thank him and praise him put this down then there's to be a weekly cessation of in verses 9 and 10 we read this then on the Sabbath day two male Lambs one year old without defect two tenths of an epha of fine but it's added to it part of worship that the Lord wants us is to learn to rest now some of us go I have no problem with that great sounds good but you got to understand there was no ancient culture that took a day off the Jews initially had a hard time remember when God said I'm going to provide man every day except on the seventh day you're going to get you", "won't get any on that seventh day so don't go out looking for man what'd they do they went out looking for manna remember that and don't store it up because if you do it'll it'll grow worms but they did that too it's like God says to do that why I don't know if he'll really do it and I don't know why besides if we go out we can probably sell out of the black metal Market or whatever you know there's just always that kind of a person who's looking for just but here's the problem there's something inside of us that wants to not do what God tells us to because we just aren't sure he'll show up look I don't like doing dishes you say I would have never guessed Bob you look like a vicious kind of guy every once in a while I will start then what I don't like is stopping quite often my wife well honey come on let's just be together I just I I'm gonna I wanna I wanna say it is finished you know I want to push the button on the dishwashing machine not for any great honor I just when you when you're working you don't want to stop when you're doing something there is something else and then the ancient cultures did not want to take a day off believe me they did not and God said you're going to do it because you're going to learn to trust me I'm going to provide for you though you're not going to work as much as you could as much as you would or used to or other people are you need to learn to rest and that was very unique to the world but it was not only obedience to God's word and was an act of worship to not work but it was to say Lord I know you're going to provide for me and I'm going to follow your example in creation you rested God on the seventh day I'm now going to rest as well you see the idea of rest and worship has the idea of I'm going to for things that I might be tempted to just try to do myself and by the way there's a great verse jotted down Psalm 127 verse 2. here's what it says it's vain it doesn't mean you're vain like you're all into yourself it just means empty it's a waste of time for you to rise up early and to retire late now this isn't talking about late retiring so I'm not going to bed to eat the bread of painful labors", "for God gives to his beloved even in his now this is not against hard work it's not against getting up early Jesus got up early it's not against you know if you want to go stay up late to do something it's not saying it's a sin what it says if you think that the answer is your hard work you got to do it all yourself because God's not really going to do anything for you you have not yet learned to worship and trust God the way he wants you to you know where we see this verse lived out well several places in the Bible but I think of Adam it's not good for the man to be alone remember he's naming the animals and they're all kind of I don't know why it seems like always picture like the arks they're coming in Mr and Mrs to be named by Adam doesn't say that but he's naming the animals and they're kind of pairing up or whatever and but no help me for Adam I'm not sure what that even means I don't know but none of these seem to be the right one maybe you've had that experience but you're dating none of these seem to be the right one I tell people who say there's not a person in my life that I could possibly marry well maybe you're not supposed to get married right now well there's nobody on this Earth listen there probably is but even if there wasn't according to the Bible and you was time God would make you one but when did he do it after he put Adam to sleep Adam's a worker Adam's a hard worker I'm smart hadn't sinned yet he'll fix it he's Home Depot you can do it I can help you know he knows how to do it he's Mr MacGyver but he had no solution here and that's why God gave him a problem that was too big for him so he could learn to rest and wake up and see what God God gives to his beloved even in his sleep that's who received protection while he rested more than one but definitely Daniel thrown into the lion's den it's how he's supposed to get eaten instead Daniel has a good night's sleep and the Lions just one night more hungry to eat the guys the next day but not Peter he's asleep the night he's supposed to be killed the next morning you know if I was going to be killed the next morning I might not I'm not sure I'd want to be asleep or maybe I would", "well I'd like to sleep through it but uh Jesus in the storm is sleeping everybody else is running around going crazy we're going down not the Bible says in Psalm 37 in verse 5 that we should commit our way to the Lord trust also in him and he will do it and and then in verse 7 we read in that same Psalm rest in the Lord wait patiently for him don't fret because of him who prospers in his way because of the man who carries out wicked schemes the Bible says be still and know that I'm God the Hebrew could also be translated cease striving you won't know he's God until you stop and give him a chance to work put this down number three a monthly is the third area of timing a monthly intensification let's sacrifice so there's daily morning and night that we're given then added to it was the weekly Sabbath of rest and the sacrifices they were actually there were more sacrifices not just more exactly of the same but more quantity on top of the daily and then if you read verses 11 through 15 which I have you'll find that they're the same kinds of sacrifices but there there's additional ones now we have two bowls for the first time added to the others and a Ram plus two Lambs plus I'm sorry it was two Lambs now goes to seven Lambs every day once a month uh daily it was one-tenth of an IFA a fine flower weekly it went to two tenths and then monthly it jumps up to uh 15 tenths about 75 pounds I mean it's a whole lot more being offered uh to the Lord as a nation monthly every month there was a special time to start the month in total sacrifice and surrender to God and at least we can draw this principle out as time goes by God's intention in the year the sacrifice became greater and greater okay the daily but it's more than on the Sabbath now is added to the Daily Now the monthly is added even on top of the daily and the Sabbath very interesting and I think of Abraham you know the Bible tells us that Abraham offered up or was willing to offer up his son Isaac we all know the story you know I mean uh that's kind of a crazy story I don't know if you have kids I've ever told them the story it's kind of scary for a kid yes God the most faithful guy in the world God told him to offer his son up", "in Fire on the Mountain I love the Lord but I remember my kids were little you yes you could hardly talk I said you remember what God told Abraham to do with his son burn them up burn them up I'm looking okay it doesn't seem to bother you so okay um but the Bible says in Genesis 22 verse 1 that God said to Abraham it says it came about after these things that God said to Abraham take now thy son thine only son and offer them up on the mountain up there on Mariah the mountain that I'll show you now it's very interesting because that's this Pinnacle of Faith really I mean most of us wouldn't even imagine because God isn't going to call you to do that he's Imaging what he's going to do with his own son and he doesn't even ask Abraham actually to kill his son he doesn't ask him to actually do it he stops him from doing so but that principle is this the Bible says we're to go from Faith to Faith we go from glory to glory we go from strength to strength the idea is that we're maturing and that we have new lessons to learn in our life some of us need to go back and learn the same lessons we've learned before with like well okay I didn't I used to know that and I forgot that I'm supposed to trust you with that problem or that I if you're going back for a little you know we feel like there's the apostles and the bee Apostles or whatever and we're in that secondary group remedial training but the fact is even if you're doing good and you're walking towards there are new things the Lord is going to test you in in new ways that he's never tested you in before and there's going to be greater sacrifices uh to make I I I remember hearing a story of a man he was going through all these trials as a Christian walked through this construction site it was a church and he saw these guys working on this piece of glass and they were cutting it and then putting this frame on and he said what are you guys doing and they said oh this this is a window for up there see that whole way up there they go we're shaping it down here so it'll fit up there before and he realized that's what God's doing in my life he's shaping me down here so I will fit up there remember Jesus said I go to", "prepare a place for you that where I am you baby also but until basically I come to bring you to that place I'm getting you ready down here I'm preparing you for the place I've been a prepared place for you but I'm preparing you for the place that's exactly what this life is all about put this down the sacrifices were very and of course they picture the death of Christ and and our Redemption Psalm 49 verse 8 talks about this for the Redemption of a soul is costly and and we should cease trying to do it ourselves forever and then First Peter 1 18 and 19 know that you were not redeemed with perishable things like silver and gold those are cheap by comparison from your feudal way of life inherited from your forefathers but you were redeemed with the precious blood as of a lamb unblemished and spotless the blood of Jesus Christ it's just amazing and then we do need to take a moment and notice that there's something added at the last verse verse 15. they then were told monthly one male goat of makes no sense to people they say well I can see you know the picture of a lamb even a ram which is a sheep you know that's a picture of Jesus but why would a goat I thought goats were supposed to be pictures of unbelievers you know that's right remember in the sheep goat judgment Matthew 25 Jesus will come back as a shepherd and separate the Nations as a Shepherd separates the sheep from the goats the Sheep are going in the goats are not remember the old song I don't want to be a goat nope you don't know that song I don't want to be a goat nope because a goat ain't got no hope nope I don't want to be a girl yeah so it's very odd like how how does this picture Jesus well what you need to remember is that on Yom Kippur the day of atonement the highest holiday in Israel the most important day where the sins of the nation are being forgiven it's pictured by the sacrifice of Two one goat that's blood is actually put on in the holiest place there is on The Mercy Seat the high priest goes in one day a year this is the highest holiest day goes in and puts the blood of the goat on there and then secondly the other goat the sins of the nation are confessed over they lay hands on it and it is sent away Into the Wilderness", "never to be seen again and that's called the scapegoat do you know that phrase the scapegoat that comes from the Bible it it is sent away never to come back on the pictures that part that our sins have been taken away Behold the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world so our sins have been removed and also we have been the they our sins have been atoned for by the blood of Christ so Jesus Christ is pictured as a goat you say well that doesn't make any sense to me the goats are sinners what does the Bible says God made him who knew no sin to be sin on our behalf that we might become the righteousness of God in him Jesus on the cross is the sinner it's you it's me it's everything we've ever done wrong being punished you see he took our place he took our place why so that we could have his place and that's why a goat is used for a sin God's desired sacrifice could only by fire by fire all through this chapter you will see that God keeps talking about how fire has to be God through the fire now sometimes we talk about being on fire for the Lord and that's a good thing I think sometimes people maybe can get turned off to the any talking about Zeal like yeah people are zealous it's just all emotional well it can be emotional by the way I'm not against emotional worship of the Lord I'm not against it in fact I think some people need to learn to worship god with their emotions I do I think too many people too many Christians I know are just intellectual and they feel like that's the right way to worship God you know spirit and truth it's like well there's some truth there but here's what the Bible says we're to worship God with all of our hearts soul mind and strength in other words every part of Who We Are yeah if it's over emotional or only emotional that's not necessarily spiritual but if you think spiritual is non-emotional you are wrong when David danced before the Lord with all of his might God is insane Nathan down there to calm that boy down no God was pleased with that and frankly I think sometimes we get the idea that emotion is a spirit that's or any emotion is not the spirit it's the devil no that's not right either here's what the Bible says in Romans 12 talking to Christians like me and you B", "this is one translation that is the RSV be a glow with the spirit that's a command of God be a glow with the spirit and the word and the Greek speaks of a metal that is heated up so hot that it's glowing like a piece of metal that's or if it's liquid it's molten that's what God wants he wants our hearts to be what did the two on the road do Emma say when Jesus spoke to us did not our hearts burn that's the right kind of heartburn man that's what we need you know and uh what happened on Pentecost the Holy Spirit came in the form not of a dove this time tongues of fire over every single one of their heads and what did they do when they were filled with the Holy Spirit it was over the we were on fire by the they started praising God that's what they did well they spoke in tongues yeah but what did it go read what that tongues interpreted were they were praising God in languages people could understand that's what happens when you're filled with the Holy Spirit how do I know it because I've read Ephesians and so have you don't be drunk with wine that's not being Spirit-filled that's the wrong but be filled or controlled by the Holy Spirit speaking to one another in Psalms and hymns and spiritual songs singing making melody in your heart to the lord always giving thanks for all things you're thanking God you're praising that's what the Holy Spirit does he causes you to want to talk about the Lord and what he's done to say the words praise the Lord not because it's the right time in the church service where it's one of the lines of the songs but because you're really wanting to praise that's what the Holy Spirit causes us in the Book of Revelation I'll close with this our worship Him can come Jesus said to that church at laodicea I wish that you were cold or hot man Irish I really would rather you were but you're what I mean he said it without saying it the way I'm going to say it but basically he would say being lukewarm makes me sick because I'll spit you out of my mouth I'll reject you I'll vomit you out of my mouth is what he's really saying I I don't want listen you understand what to have somebody who does not share your affection for them you love somebody and they don't love you well they're let's be friends you know but you're in love with them that", "is sickening to you that is not what you that's not you want someone who you love to love you passionately back so does the Lord no one has ever or will ever love you more passionately than Jesus Christ has and does right this moment he wants you to respond with that same kind of love here's what it says of King Amazon second chronicles he did right in the sight of the Lord but not with a whole heart and I think to myself yeah not with a hot heart either and so maybe some of us just need to say Lord I used to be on fire maybe you say I've never been on fire really good news is this you don't work that up you just get close enough to the fire the Bible says our God is a consuming fire I've noticed things about fire if they get if something gets close enough to fire guess what it catches he said but I'm so dry dry things catch really good they're great don't worry God can set you up it's about you getting close to him it's not about you working it up and feeling guilty I'm not on fire I should be more on fire you can't make yourself on fire he's not asking you to do that he's asking you to let yourself be filled with the Holy Spirit who will give you a brand new capacity to praise and worship Him amen all right well let's let's all stand and let's close with a song he did be there nobody but Jesus This Is Our God well I haven't heard you guys say it you've listened to me say it but I haven't heard you sing it in a while so let's do that one the Lord bless thee the Lord make his face to shine upon and be gracious and be gracious the Lord lift up upon thee and give thee peace amen I tonight just as you're getting ready to fall asleep and get in bed to say Lord I want to close the night off I just want to say thank you for being faithful to me you've been faithful my whole life I know I can trust you tomorrow for the problem to solve right now and I don't want to be worried about it Jesus said tomorrow today is enough for itself just just say Lord thank you for getting me through one more day and that you'll meet me in the morning I like when the psalmist said when I awake I'm still with thee and Lord I'll see you in the morning same bat Channel", "but I I I I want to I want to wake up and thank you in the morning for your mercy and that you're ready to give me a brand new day help me to worship you help me to praise you I'm going to be surrendered to you more than I am more than I've ever been so that when I go to work today or when I'm with other people they can see the fires that glow in My Heart Lord set sent me on fire for you I I can't do it I thank you you don't want me to try you just want me to be willing to let you do the work and he'll do a new work in you prayer room's open if you need it Lord bless you", "what your next step might be and so let's pray let's offer this next song to the lord let's offer our time to the lord we're going to get into the word there in hebrews chapter 11. i'm excited to to hear about the great faith that we're going to read about here this morning so let's uh go before the lord lord we're thankful to be here i'm thankful to lift up a shot of praise even if our countenance doesn't always wear it we want to exude the joy of the lord here this morning your presence is here the fullness of joy can be experienced in your presence and so we're thankful we're grateful we're excited as earlier that the battle belongs to you we can fight on our knees what the world sees as a as a sign of giving up or a sign of surrender we find it to be a sign of great power because there's power in our prayers there's power in our surrender because of the one who we are surrendering to and so we want to surrender every aspect of our life lord to you here this morning as we go from one degree of glory to the next degree of glory we love you we thank you we commit it into your hands in jesus name amen created from this now you're taking us high i'm just so affected by the words you stepped into time you lay down your life to you took all our shame on the cross it was late now you're taking to us to glory we'll never be the same we'll never be the same we go for

here you can go on there and hit confirm with cabbage out with anaheim and we'll keep the directory so that is all for our open your bibles and let's get into nice haircut josh this is the week all staff has to get a haircut i guess so together i would like you to open your bibles to hebrews chapter 11 as we continue our study verse by verse through the bible but through the book of hebrews and now in chapter 11 a study we're calling in faith we have looked thus far at those three anti-deluvians which just uh with uh abel and enoch and noah who walked by faith lived by faith obeyed by faith and then abraham now we studying the patriarchs we've looked at abraham and isaac and now we are going to look today at verse 21 at jacob hebrews 11 21 by faith jacob as he was dying blessed each of the sons of joseph and he worshipped leaning on the top of father i pray that you would draw for us the truth your holy spirit put this reference here one verse lord and yet we know there's a whole life behind this that jacob lived a long life 12 chapters in the old testament more than we could possibly com bring out today but lord would you bring out those nuances for this family for us so that we might live and if it would be your will die by faith we want to honor you with our whole life in amen you can be seated so we have been talking about this hall of faith or heroes of the faith from the old testament in the new testament remember the book of hebrews written to jewish christians struggling with really accepting the christ's finished work was enough and going back into the ritual of the temple and the writer is encouraging them to endure", "in faith you have to read chapter 11 light of chapter 12 where he's going which is he's building the audience he's building those that are in the arena that he'll mention in chapter 12 saying seeing that we're surrounded by so great a cloud of witnesses and that's chapter 11 and everyone is lived by faith but all these who who were given promises by god and who believed even though they didn't receive the promises themselves lived and died in faith and then he's going to say now you do it live with endurance run the race with endurance the race that is set before you and he he's going to ultimately of course look at jesus who for the joy set before him endured the cross it's one thing to talk about living in faith we come to these three uh isaac and jacob and joseph and uniquely the focus on them is dying in faith we talked about blessing our children a couple of weeks i don't know how many of you have done that already or did it after that day i did get some messages from some of you saying i want to do that others just said i don't know how to do that you know my my daughter's an atheist and uh you know a new ager and i don't really know how to pronounce a blessing on her and i thought well i'll pray for you you know uh but but the answer to that i most of you know this is that it's not about their faith it's about yours remember we talked about that with isaac at that point when isaac was pronouncing neither esau who clearly never came to nor his brother jacob were really they were believers in name or at least jacob wasn't and yet isaac pronounced a and he did it 50 years before he died so it's not too early but now we come to actually the blessing that was placed on some grandchildren again how many of you have grandchildren how many of you are ever going to have okay you don't know for sure but just checking it was charles haddon spurgeon who said this god is greatly glorified when his people leave this world with their flags flying at full mast and i think that this is a good picture of a man who at the end of his life can be included in the book of faith and there are many who start out as we've said by faith who don't end with faith the problem that i have this morning as somebody who really wants to teach on", "you say it shouldn't be hard bob it's only one verse yeah but hebrews 11 21 to understand it you need to actually read genesis 48 1-21 which is the background and to study that and i would encourage you to do so because we will only be able to touch to touch it a little bit what does it mean to die in faith and what specifically did jacob do that he is included in the bible as a died in faith why don't i just give you three words they're not on your outline but just in case you miss everything there are three words in verse 21 that you say well if i'm going to die in faith these need to be true of my life the first word is blessed it says he was dying but he blessed the second word is worshipped and the third word is leaned he leaned on his staff you say what do i care if he was on a walker we'll get to it but there's a reason it's in the bible now just so if you haven't been with us and a lot of you haven't necessarily been with us on wednesday night or maybe it's been a while since you've studied the old story of jacob uh or pardon me of uh jacob's blessing on his grandkids back in chapter 47 48 and actually his sons in 49 here's what's happening by this time in the biblical story joseph is now ruling in egypt god's already uh to be the right-hand man of pharaoh hears that his father jacob who he's from canaan to egypt he hears that his is sick and so he he asks to be with his father and he brings his two sons manasseh and ephraim both of whom by the way were born in egypt uh you know jacob had uh or joseph had married an egyptian woman so we have kind of a mixed marriage and two sons who were brought up in egypt who are meeting their grandfather jacob for the very first time so they go with dad to meet jacob and jacob is so sick he is actually on and he will die shortly thereafter and we have in chapter 48 of genesis this of joseph arriving to his dad's place along with his sons and jacob pronounces a blessing on his grandsons and it's a fascinating he actually declares joseph's sons his grandsons manasseh and ephraim to be his own sons he says those are mine i'm going to treat them like they're mine and he takes manasseh and he kisses them he hugs them they're", "little children at this point and then he pronounces this blessing on them and i want to read it this is from genesis 48 verse 15. he blessed joseph that's the dad and he said the god before whom my fathers abraham and isaac walked the god who has been my shepherd all my life to this day the angel who has redeemed me from all evil bless the lads the two boys then he said this may my name live on in them and the names of my fathers abraham and isaac and may they grow into a multitude in the midst of the but here was the thing when he went to bless his grandsons i remember at this point um jacob can't see very well he was almost blind but he says i want to bless him and so joseph brings manasseh who's the older the firstborn and ephraim the younger and he positions them before his father so that manasseh will be at his father's to receive the firstborn's blessing and he positions ephraim to be at his only you remember the story dad who's does one of these and puts his right on the younger and his left hand on the and he pronounces this blessing on them and at the end of that uh frankly joseph isn't real happy it's like oh wait a minute you got that wrong i know you're kind of blind but you got your you sh i don't know what you're doing with your hands there and uh jacob says no i know exactly what and this is the way it's going to be that the older will serve the younger this is he is blessing by faith clearly not by sight and he is accomplishing the will of god really prophetically speaking about god's plan for ephraim and then we read this he blessed them that day saying by you manasseh and ephraim israel will pronounce a blessing saying may god make you like ephraim and manasseh thus he put ephraim before manasseh and then israel said to joseph behold i'm about to die but god will be with you and bring you back to the land of your fathers well let's get into the meaning of this for us from hebrews 11 21 by faith he was dying but he blessed and i think you know if we just start there to think well lord i want my life to be a blessing but really when am i going to be i'm kind of hoping other people will be taking care of me i'm hoping other people will be a", "blessing to me when it's my time to go but no i actually by faith want to become a blessing when i'm dying put this down have a faith that is strong to the finish paul could say i have finished the course i have kept the faith and think about the time of your death now look you don't know how you're going you could die suddenly i mean you don't always have control over those days of your death so we know that but if you are in a process of dying like many of probably will be unless the rapture happens first put this down it is your last chance to share your faith and i want you to think about that he died by faith and he he actually shared his faith i i mean i like um i like to study people's last words sometimes there are some interesting things that people have said right at the end of their life this is the reported words of general pancho via his last words were don't let it end tell them that i said something whoever he said that to we don't have a clue what it was he said by the way that's disputed but some say that's what he said grover cleveland reading's last words this is not without said i have something to say but not at and then he was executed so we don't know what it was he wanted to say um funny but maybe not you probably haven't thought about what your last words were you haven't had to and i'm not saying you need to today but i want you to see that jacob's last words which is chapter 48 and chapter 49 there's quite a few words we're actually words that find themselves into the they were inspired by god and they were directed toward his family to encourage them and to let them know what god saw in them very interesting uh to me i heard a story of a man as the story died and he's in front of the pearly because that's what all stories talk about and uh he's he's approached by an angel and the angel asks him the most important question which is have you received jesus christ as your lord and savior while you were alive on earth and he said yes i have and the angel checks his records and says yep your name's in here that's great now let's talk about he says what do you mean he says well i just you know i want to get you ready for the ceremony he said", "you know were you a generous person and the man says what do you mean he said well did you give money to the poor he said well no he said how about charities he said no the angel said well that's not good he said did you ever do any good deeds like what he said well you know help your neighbors or anything like that he not really and the angels started and said i'm not really you know you're gonna have to work with me a little bit on this try to remember something and uh then the man said well wait a minute you know there was this old lady i remember i came out of a store and i found her surrounded by a dozen hell's angels they had taken and they were shoving her around and taunting and abusing her i got so mad he said i threw my bags down i fought through the crowd and i got her purse back i then helped her to her feet and i went up to the biggest baddest of the bikers and i told him how despicable and cowardly he was the angel said wow i had no idea so that's actually when did this happen he said about 10 i'm sure that's a true story why do i tell you that story because of what jay vernon mcgee points out in which is this this is the only thing that the writer of the book of hebrews the holy spirit lifts out of an entire life of jacob to say that he did it by faith one thing now it's not to say that he didn't do other things but it is the that is mentioned mcgee says jacob was on his deathbed and this is the first in his life you can lift out and say by jacob does one thing and it's like well that's hopefully not going to be our case but we ought to make sure it is our case that at least the way we die was given to the lord for all that it could be used for for his glory it's our last chance it is your last time to demonstrate your faith to share your with the people that around you put this down make your departure as much as you can a blessing make your departure a blessing i want you to jot down luke 24 verses 50 through 53 luke 24 50. this is jesus after he has it says he led his disciples out as far he lifted up his hands and he did what well he blessed them", "while he was blessing he parted from and he was carried up into heaven and they after worshiping him returned to jerusalem with great joy and we're continually in the temple praising god now there's a lot about christ's ascension we could talk about but we should at least say this it was a blessing literally he blessed as he was leaving and in a very real sense we say well i want that to be the case obviously jacob was dying and jesus was already resurrected but jesus was a blessing when he was dying i think we'd all agree on the cross he was a blessing to that thief on the cross who changed his mind about jesus don't think that that thief always thought jesus was the messiah he came to faith on the cross that's he no doubt was a blessing to those who later repented if they did when he said father forgive them they don't know what he was no doubt a blessing to mary and in caring for them after he was gone no jesus was blessing people even as he was dying now most of us when we're sick when we're hurting we're not at our best and jacob is sick and weak and bed bound in genesis 48 and verses 2 through 4 let me read to you what it says when it was told to jacob behold your son joseph has come to israel collected his strength he sat up in the bed and then jacob said to joseph god almighty appeared to me at luz in the land of canaan and he blessed me and he said to me behold i will make you fruitful and i will make you a company of peoples and will give this land to your descendants after you for an everlasting possession then in verse 7 he said this now as for me when i came from padan rachel died to my sorrow in the land of canaan on the journey when there was still distance to go to ephrath and i buried her there on the way to ephrath that is bethlehem now this might not sound like a blessing to any of us because it's actually history but it's interesting to where this blessing begins when he first opens his mouth to spend the last time with joseph and with his grandsons he about the day he met the lord that's what he's talking about you're familiar with jacob's ladder you remember the jacob because of his sin against esau his sin against his father had to run had to flee lest esau kill and while he is running he exhausted", "spends the night in a little town village whatever it was called luz remember he uses a stone for a pillow and he has this incredible dream where god reveals himself to him and there's this ladder with angels ascending and descending from heaven to earth which we later will find out as a type of christ in john chapter one but then he doesn't know he just knows god is revealing he has never known the lord he's never met the he believes in god but he doesn't live and god tells him the same covenant that i've had with your father and your grandfather abraham i'm going to have i'm going to bless your life i'm going to bring you back to this place because he didn't know if he'd ever be coming he just knew that his brother wanted to kill him and so it's an interesting thing he begins the blessing and we i think would take this out of if you want to be a blessing to your family to your kids and your grandkids tell when you met the lord folks this was 70 years earlier than when he's dying but he remembers it like it was and i think in a sense we need to some of us brush off our testimonies you know i was reading a story of charles wesley and charles wesley brother of john wesley knew the birth date that he got saved maybe you do and as that was coming up it was in may he decided he was 30 years old at the time and he wrote the words of this hymn the first two stanzas have to do with great theology the third one says this long my imprisoned spirit lay fast bound in sin and nature's night thine eye defused a quickening ray i woke the dungeon flamed with light what happened with peter in the book of acts as his background but he's my chains fell off my heart was free i rose went forth and followed thee amazing love how can it be that thou my god should die for me he doesn't just want to sing about theology he wants to talk about how it changed his life how there was a day he didn't know the lord and god revealed himself and just like peter peter didn't get saved well he did get saved but that wasn't the first time he met jesus but but charles wesley sees himself in that where like jim peterson who in 1961 wrote these words oh what a wonderful day i will never forget after i'd wandered in darkness away jesus", "my savior i met oh what a tender he met the needs of my heart shadows dispelling with joy i am telling he made all the darkness depart heaven came down and glory filled my when at the cross the savior made me whole my sins were washed away my night was turned to day heaven came down and glory filled my soul jim peterson wrote that after an old man named jim got up and shared a testimony at montrose bible college conference and he used the phrase he said it was like when i got saved it was like heaven came down and it was like glory was filling my heart and he thought that's what i want that's what happened to me i don't care what age it is here's jacob saying i want this blessing to start out by you knowing i wasn't always a christian i wasn't always saved i didn't always know the but when i was running from my sin let me summarize this story when i was running from the consequences of my sin god revealed himself to me and he didn't blast me about my sins he blessed me in spite of them and by the way that's my story too god decided he wanted me when nobody else should have or could have and that's true for you too and then he goes from the story of how he got saved and the next thing that he mentions in his whole life journey is he mentions the day that rachel died now that's interesting to me because if the high point was god's grace when he met him no doubt one of the low rachel's death remember she died giving to benjamin so there's a baby being born i'm sure they had plans for benjamin's life this child that's being born and none of that's going to come to fruition because rachel is dying rachel was the one that he loved rachel is the one that he had worked seven the love of his life and he mentions this to joseph not only did the lord meet me in bethel but along the way rachel your mother by the way joseph would have been about witnessed that whole thing when mom died one of the hardest days no doubt in as well why would jacob mention that why would that be a blessing because you see god had said to him in luz i will be with you i will keep you i will never leave you there are other people that will leave you either because they give up on you or it's their time to go", "but god's saying i never will you see his testimony is my life was changed when i met the lord and during my life during the hardest he never left me he had more life for me after my precious wife was taken put this down bless your children's we talked about blessing your children but here we have a model for blessing you might say well bob that's nice but they live across country i don't spend much time with them i i've never been that close to my grandkids but uh jot down genesis 48 verses 8 and genesis 48 verse 8 when israel saw joseph's sons that's his grandkids who are they i don't think we can use it as an excuse we don't know them that well he goes who are these kids these would be your i couldn't tell they're all in their egyptian outfits you know maybe say well my grandkids are worldly yeah so were they probably yes they were joseph's kids but they brought were brought up in egypt they had a egyptian mother and jacob that day saying they're going to be part of the family of faith you see joseph said to his father they're my sons whom god has given me here so he said bring them to me please that i may you know you say you don't know your grandkids can i tell you god's just asking you to bless your grandkids by that's all not by sight once again you don't have to even know them to pronounce a blessing on them jot down genesis 48 verses 15 and 16 says he blessed joseph said the god before whom my fathers abraham and isaac walked the god who has been my shepherd all my life to this day the angel who has redeemed me from all evil bless the lads and may my name live on in them in the names of my fathers abraham and isaac and may they grow into a multitude in the midst of the earth if you want to bless your son or daughter bless their kids if you want to bless me speak value about my children and you'll bless me you see actually the blessing on the grandkids is also a blessing on joseph you can't remove those two they're they're both being blessed here and he says i want my name to live on in them well what was his name his name was given by god in genesis 32 was changed remember not that's not what he meant what's his name say it out loud israel please know we'll get to it in a", "what happened but the name israel could god governed a prince with god or god he says i want my name to live in those and so did joseph god govern and and not just my name but also the name of my grandfather and my father isaac abraham means father of a multitude fruitful you'll see and isaac means bringing laughter i want all the character and the blessings of i have known and my father has known and my grandpa i want them all to live on in those kids the second thing i see here is in in the is put in the word worship he he blesses he leaves a blessing in the air you but he also is blessed them by allowing them to see him worship as he's dying he is worshiping now what does that mean he was playing and singing no but he was worshiping god even until the time that he died genesis and verse 31 genesis 47 31 he said swear to me this is what he's joseph or uh joseph is swinging to him so he swore him then israel bowed in at the head of the bed this is during the same time that he's gathered with you know i tell you something i i don't know about you but i'm guessing you're a lot like me you know what blesses me is to see other i sat down here this morning i looked up totally encouraged as i see them sing the lord i love to watch casey worship i've told her so it's no secret i love to see people that are passionate about the lord because i feel like whenever here's what i believe whenever you see somebody who's passionate about the lord and you know them that it's genuine you say to yourself yeah that's exactly how i feel i may not be able to sing like that i may be able to emote like that but that's how i feel and your chil if you want to bless your children and your children's children then be a worshiper until the day you die even the day you die even in your pain continue to worship god what did job say the day that his kids died god gave god's taken away but what i'm gonna bless his name right now worst moment of my whole life but it doesn't change the fact that these children were his gifts i could focus on all that i'm not going to have or i can focus on what i did have and how it came to me from god and i'm going to focus on god", "gave me them and guess what they didn't leave one second before god wanted them he made that decision he's smarter than me i don't get it i don't like it but i trust him and i'm gonna bless his character his name he worshipped the hardest moment and here's jacob wrecked in pain but he is going to he's going to worship god you know i think back many of you know i attended a lutheran church as a child every and frankly in a lot of ways it was just the culture i grew up in it was just what we did i i can't say there was any real faith much in me i believed intellectually i didn't i didn't deny there was a god i was not certainly living a godly life but i went to church religiously and i'll never forget as i think back about all those years i only one distinct moment of singing with my family my mom my dad my brothers and sisters were all there one moment that i can remember i don't remember the name of the hymn i can remember a bunch of the hymns but i don't remember which one it was but i singing this particular hymn and i don't know how i and how i was sitting next to and i looked up at my dad or maybe we were standing we probably were and i just remember he had tears in his now you don't know my dad but my dad was talking about stoic my dad was a genius but he was all inside i hardly ever saw express emotion ever toward anything but when i saw as a little boy i saw my being impacted by the words of the hymn we were singing i realized this my dad really believes this my dad he loves god he feels everything he's singing and it was impacting i'm 64 almost and i remember it like it worship your god in front of your kids and in front of your grandkids let them see the reality of the faith have and there's several things i want you to see here about worship put this down leave a blessing in the air now i'm talking about blessing god but a blessing that they can witness it was not by the way jacob's natural to do this it's been said there are two kind of people in this world there are fault finders and there are fruit finders kind of which one are you we all can pick out well i know people like no i'm not asking you to tell me that", "you know some of each but if we look in the mirror there are fruit finders and there are fault finders jesus said i came three years looking for fruit i'm but our natural tendency is to be a you know i think of when joseph who's an important guy in egypt introduces his father jacob to the king of the world to pharaoh that's kind of a big deal right not so much for pharaoh but for jacob and maybe even for joseph i want you to meet my dad i mean pharaoh was pretty impressed with joseph it's like i'd like to meet your dad and so old jacob is brought all the way to caden and this is the moment talk about a moment to be a witness to the king of the world you can jot it down it's genesis 47 verses 8 through 10. here's what it says pharaoh in medium says to jacob how many years have you lived in other words how old are you you could see he was an old guy so jacob said to pharaoh the years of my sojourning are 103 he's 130 years old then he describes them few and unpleasant have been the years of my nor have they attained to the years that my father's lived during the days of and jacob blessed pharaoh and he went out from his presence now personally i think that might be should be reversed he went out from his and he blessed pharaoh by going because think about this is his moment this is what he asked how old are you he didn't ask him his opinion about his life he didn't ask compare yourself to other people that have lived longer than you but there is nothing talk about an not a moment of faith as far as i'm concerned in jacob's life jacob had a very negative perspective on his life at this point and he did many other times when joseph he thought was dead and his fear was he was going to lose other members of his family particularly he just felt like he said these things are all against me no they actually weren't but he just didn't know it yet they were all romans 8 28. god was going to save his family move him to egypt he had a plan but jacob couldn't see that just like so often we can't jacob was a man who many times just walked in the flesh now what's interesting is 17 years later now dying he thinks he's almost going to die the day he's beating pharaoh he thinks", "he's going to die a lot a lot of us think we're going to die before we do have you noticed that some of you thought you're going to die at a certain age and here you are you know for me it was 26. don't ask me why i have no idea i'm probably going to make it to 26. then it was maybe 27. i mean it's kind of a weird thing like you're grieving your own death before anybody else's 17 years later jacob is dying and he's singing a tune on this day and i just i just love that he is now blessing people jot down ephesians 4 22-24 here's what it says to us as christians paul says in reference to your former manner of life when before you were saved lay aside the old jacob which is being corrupted in accordance with the lusts of deceit and that you be renewed in the spirit of your mind and you put on the new self the israel which is in the likeness of god it's been created in righteousness and of the truth at the end of his life jacob is now israel in fact seven times in genesis 48 he's called most of the time after he got his name changed he's still called jacob he had a new name he had a new nature but he still struggled very rarely is he actually called israel but at the very end israel israel israel israel israel and as he dies he dies in faith no no longer comparing himself to other people but his eyes are really on the so here's the second thing i want you to under be put in the word he speak less if you want to die in faith speak less of thee and more of he genesis 48 and verse 3 begins with this phrase then jacob said to joseph this is the almighty appeared to me at least the first words out of his mouth are el the first words out of his mouth are not about they're not even about him they're about god it was uh william carey uh was dying and he he was called dr kerry by the way and his family and friends were coming over to visit with him people in the and he would hear them whispering about and they would say dr kerry this was dr he kept hearing his name being mentioned by this group of people who loved him and he got a little upset he said you guys come over here to his death bed and he said after i'm speak less of dr kerry", "and much more of dr kerry's savior don't talk about me talk about jesus you el shaddai god almighty it reminds me the story of the guy who went to here he went on vacation and he was going to be out in the east coast he was going to visit two huge super big churches famous pastors and i won't give you their names but he was gonna go visit them and hear them in person and these people are already famous all over the world and so his friend got to him after he came back said what do you think of those two guys did you get to hear me so i got here in both he said well what did you think about them and he said well the first one he is an amazing preacher he said the has an amazing savior yeah what does jacob say about the lord if you read genesis 48 let me summarize it for you you can fill in the blanks he and gracious he is merciful and gracious again the day i met the lord i was running from the consequences of my sin but he didn't bring him up once put this down he gives a hope and a future this is genesis 48 4. he said to me behold i will make you fruitful and numerous i'll make you a company of peoples and i'll give this land to your descendants after you for an everlasting possession in other words my at that i was running from my sin i was poor i he'll later say all he had was a staff with him his future was completely what was going to happen and yet god starts breathing and speaking promises into him about the plan that he has for his future to give him the land and to bring him back put this down he testified that he is my family put in the word restore and look genesis 48 and verse 11 israel said to joseph i never expected to see your face remember he thought he was dead i never expected to ever see your face and behold god has let me see your children as well talk about the prodigal the testimony about the prodigal my son was and now he's alive that's exactly what jacob could say about joseph for years i i was sure you were dead i'd never get to see you again but here you are and i'm seeing you face to face in fact you know what jacob said when he was told he could go to egypt and find his son was there he", "it's enough if my son is alive i'll just go there i'll see his face and i'll die that's all i need it's kind of like the of simeon remember when jesus is given to him in the temple after he's born and simeon praises god he says now lord thou just let thy servant depart in peace according to your word mine eyes have seen the salvation of israel i can die in peace why because i i've seen your promise when he's here it's like that jacob says if joseph is alive by the way joseph is the savior of the world egypt and israel he's a type of christ he says if i can just see him that's enough but he he gets to see his son and then he gets to see his children's children he said this is exceedingly abundantly before more than i ever thought would be possible god has restored my family it's part of his testimony it's part of yours too or what god wants it to be he's my faithful shepherd put in the word shepherd in chapter 48 and verse 15 48 15. that's not the right one but he says he has been my shepherd my entire life he has been my shepherd my entire life the god before whom my father and my grandfather walked has been my shepherd my whole life even until now in other words he's looking back on his life and he said you know what as i look back i can see how the lord has his hand on my life by the way i hope you've come to a place as a christian where you look beyond the day you receive christ and you see how god was working sovereignly in your life you know god didn't just start working in your life when you got saved how do i because the bible says he predestined you before the foundation of the world and he didn't just wait well when they get saved i'll start working on their oh no everything what did chuck say in everything is preparation for something and i look back the longer i'm a christian the more i look back into the days before i was saved then i see god getting me ready to be saved putting me in places not just in my family but even in that church that i got nothing out of god was giving me theology that would be necessary for me to receive christ and here he is jacob is looking back and he says you know what he was my shepherd my whole life", "he even was taking the things that i did wrong the sinful desires that i had to get god's blessing my way and he's turned that around for my blessing and then put this down he's my powerful redeemer in 48 then joseph said the god before okay that's the verse that i was looking for he's my shepherd and then he says this the angel who has redeemed me from all evil bless what did he need redeeming from just like me and you a lot of sin in saying that he has been redeemed he's talking about the fact that he ripped and he stole his birthright he's talking about the fact that he committed identity theft he's talking about the fact that he deceived his father i think he's probably referring to the fact that he skipped out on laban remember layman went out to shear his sheep and and uh jacob said to his wives and kids let's get out of here while he's out of town you know quick he's too scared to deal with laban in person and so he runs and laban has to you know down jacob was a man whose name jacov means heel catcher because he is one who came out of the womb as a twin holding on to the heel of esau and so he got that name he one who grabs the heel of somebody else the idea is of one who supplants or takes advantage of someone else one of the earliest movies i've ever me there's no sound back then but there's a little video of me and i am just starting to walk i'm out on some and my grandfather on my dad's side is watching me try to take a few steps and then he grabs my ankle i go and then everybody laughs and i get back up and try to walk that's kind of what this word is somebody who grabs the heel of another for whatever reason to take advantage of them and that's exactly what yakov was and by the way it was his character out for number one that's me and by the way mom taught me well that he would have said rebecca was in on that too she had her own struggle and he was given to getting everything even the blessing of god i'll get the blessing of god but i'm going to do it and god won't bless that but he'll and so jacob goes through his life and he is always struggling with other people whether it's his brother or his dad or his boss and eventually he's struggling with god", "the whole time his whole life he had struggled with really believing god but he comes to that place where he realizes he has been redeemed put this down he's our everlasting god all of these are mentioned in 48 and then he mentions that god will be his son and his grandsons he says behold i die but god will be with you and he'll bring you back to the land in other words i have to die but you know what that doesn't end the story of what god's doing with you because my death is not going to be god's death he doesn't die he will be it's one of those but god phrases in the bible yes this is gonna happen it's hard i don't understand what's gonna happen but i can tell you this much god's not going anywhere he'll still be faithful in your life so he exalts the lord he is worshiping the lord not just in an act of bowing down but by everything he says about the lord to his children and grandchildren put this down stop wrestling and learn to lean because the third verb that i gave you not only that he blessed while he was dying not only that he worshipped while he was dying but it says he leaned on the top of his staff and why point that out i remember when my sons were little they'd come home from school and they'd try out jokes on the family i don't know how old they were when they asked me these questions they said dad what do you call a cow with no legs i gave him a courtesy laugh i think it was then one of them said what do you call a lady with no legs or with one leg what do you call a lady with one leg i said i don't know eileen yeah those are those are elementary jokes but see the bible one of the most basic verses for the christian walk is found in proverbs 3 verses 5 and 6. trust in the lord with all your heart yeah to trust in the lord with all your means you can no longer do what you've what you do by nature what i do by which is to lean on our own for we walk by faith paul says not by sight put this down at the end of your life make it clear you are still leaning jacob was extremely self-assertive just read about his relationship with rachel how that starts it's incredible he's this bold guy that comes and waters the flock kisses her when he sees", "tells laban laban says well you know you need a job what should i pay you he goes you're your daughter i'll take her he's got some he he is convinced that uh the pagan practice of putting uh poplar rods that are striped next to where the feeding troughs were would cause the animals to produce a certain kind of an animal because that was believed in the pagan superstitious world he's not trusting god to bless him i'm gonna i have a way i've got some things i can do and god even allows it to happen it's all through his life he's trying to um when he comes on his way home finally he hears esau is coming with three hundred men last time he was with these he said here i'm gonna kill you i will soon this dad's dead i'm gonna kill you and uh so he left now after all these years he's coming home and he hears esau is coming to greet him with all these men and he knows this is not so he starts sending gifts because by this time he's wealthy so he's sending gift after gift after gift basket you know hoping to maybe assuage his anger you know the gifted secret pacifieth wrath the bible says it so he's trying to do all that he can and hoping maybe that'll make he's a little not so angry at him and and then he he's not sure that's going to work so he has all his wives his children his livestock so he divides them into three groups because you go that way you go that way you go that way and i'll just stay back sounds a little bit chicken to me but anyway he says i'll stay back you guys go and he can't get all three of us what are we gonna he's trying to outsmart esau this is just his way of living but it's on that night that he's left alone genesis 32 and he wrestles with a man who we will find out later in scripture in hosea has no man at all it's the angel of the lord but he thinks it's just a man he probably thinks he's a spy from esau's they fight and they fight on into the night and he's wrestling because that's what he is he's a wrestler he has gotten his way by wrestling through life and he's going to wrestle tonight to the well that's not the way it's going to end you remember the story the sun is and it's just matched just i don't know how they could you if you wrestle", "anything for any length of time you get exhausted i can tell you stories as a cop but you get pretty tired pretty quick just if somebody wants to fight and he had not prevailed and the angel just put enough effort into it to not let him win or to beat him until a certain moment the angel reaches out and touches him in his thigh in the hip socket and his hip is dislocated power comes out not to heal but to injure and it's almost like jacob wakes up to the reality he's not just fighting some guy he's fighting somebody that has supernatural power he seems to come to who he is and he does he's like he's he gives up immediately it's like if you could do that i'd have a chance but now instead of fighting the angel he's clinging to the angel and he says i won't let you go unless you bless me the angel says well what's your name me my name is hillcatcher con artist he says your name will no longer be you have fought with men and god and like one i just lost you got it in your and you're recognizing you're defeated in your surrender you have become victorious your name will no longer be yakov your name will be israel prince with god god govern from now on and the bible says then when jacob now israel leaves this he's limping on this thigh it says the children of israel won't even eat the sinew of the thigh of the animals anymore because it's holy that's changed our forefathers life forever suddenly became a man that he hadn't ever been he had never lived trusting god but from that point he started to realize i cannot put my weight down on my own self anymore and from that to the day that he dies he has to use a and the day that he dies he's still on top of the staff that he started using way back in genesis 32. if you want to bless your kids and your don't just tell them your testimony when you got saved don't just tell them how the lord was with you during the high points and the low points don't just tell him what a great god he's been in your life make it clear he still is the one you're totally depending on right then that day that you die and on put this down at the end let them see you're ready to be leaving why do i say that because this was a staff he's putting his weight on it", "but it's what you use when you're about to go somewhere children of israel were told to eat the passover meal standing up with their staff in their hand you guys are getting saved to go well i'll take the passover meal to go please that's right you're about to you're getting saved out of egypt you're on this faith journey to the promised land and a believer is a i want you to see that he was saying i am not done with my journey in fact i'm going somewhere by the way do you know we'll study week about his bones but jacob also said when you guys leave because he was telling him you're not gonna be here forever i know i'm going to die do you take my bones with you when you go to the promised land because god's going to fulfill his promise i don't know when and it'll be a long time but he says you take my bones with you because i've got another trip to make god's not done fulfilling his promises you know god came to hezekiah in the old testament king hezekiah and he told them through the prophet it's it's your time to die he said set your house in order set your family in order now we don't all get that kind of a message from the lord hey but sometimes we do you know maybe the lord does not heal this and the doctors this is just a matter of time maybe you'll get some window of of time i don't know but i can tell you the time to set your house in order is if you feel like well i i wouldn't want to another here's the idea do you have anything that's unresolved in relationships in your family that haven't been left the way they should be left get your set your house in order maybe it has to do with your finances maybe it has to do with your burial perhaps nothing wrong with dealing with those facts and taking that burden off your spouse and the next generation i think that's part of it but it's really and here's the old principle when it comes to die make sure that's all you have to do there's not a bunch of unfinished business that you wish you had finished now he leans on his staff because he knows that he's ready to go we ought to be to go interesting he blessed his by faith by crossing his hands and by the way even his son did not understand maybe the blessing you're going to put on your grandchildren won't", "even be understood by their parents maybe it won't make sense to them or to you but let's remember a principle we've pointed out with cain and abel and with isaac that we it's just all through scripture we shouldn't miss it joseph has two sons manasseh the firstborn who's entitled to a double portion and the greater blessing and ephraim the second born and yet god who the second birth the blessing of the firstborn is given to the second birthed who is the firstborn that's the lord in scripture he is the firstborn the blessing of the firstborn does not come to the person who's been born once said to nicodemus that which is born of is his flesh but that which is born a second time of the spirit is spirit you must be what born again it's taught again and again and again in scripture as though god is underlying it again and again you must be born again and so the greater blessing will come to the second birth in first peter 3 9 we have this truth about us as peter said this you have been called for the very purpose that you might inherit a blessing you say so you've been called for this very purpose not that you might merit a blessing you and i can't do that not from god but we can inherit a blessing one of the scenes hard to watch movie saving private ryan is the conclusion of it dramatic to say the least some of you have seen it maybe you haven't it's a story based on a true story during world war normandy france where a private in the army who's out fighting brothers he doesn't even know that also in the war and the military has decided to send out these soldiers to find him to get him off the battlefield unless mom loses all of her sons and so they're for this guy private ryan fighting germans as they go and some of them have are getting killed tom hanks who plays captain miller and is in charge of these guys says this about they haven't met private ryan yet they haven't found him yet but he says this this ryan because they found another guy named ryan who's not the right guy this ryan better be worth it the one they're looking for he better go home and cure some disease or and then a longer lasting light bulb or something to he just can't understand why the military's risking all these other people's lives for this one guy as the last couple of scenes happen um captain miller is", "dying there's been an attack by the germans and he has been shot and he's literally sitting up dying as he's trying to defend himself with a gun against private ryan comes up to him matt damon and says or or i'm sorry captain miller says to earn this james he's literally just in pain he says earn this earn it in other words all these people have died for you then they do something pretty spectacular they transform private ryan from this young kid in his early 20s maybe if that to an old man who's standing in back in france white crosses everywhere with military who have died in the war and he's there with his his family his wife was older now too and he has children and grandchildren and he walks over to the grave of captain miller and he he's by himself the family's a little bit of back so he can be by himself and he gets down on his knees in front of the grave and he says these words to captain miller he said my family is with me today they wanted to come with to be honest with you i wasn't sure how i feel coming back here every day i think about what you said to me that day on the bridge i tried to live my life the best that i could i hope that was enough i hope that at least in your eyes i've earned what all of you have done for me and he gets up and his wife comes over and he says to tell me i've lived a good life she said he says tell me i'm a good man and she doesn't understand she says you are but you don't really know for sure that he even accepts that as he looks at what has he done that is worthy of what these people did the answer in his heart of hearts is i i can't earn that you see all the religions of the world say earn this jesus christ simply says receive this you can never earn it i earned it i did what you can't do and now by faith receive it you see and this is the blessing he was leaning on what god had done for him not what he had done for god you want to die in faith i do or just be taken up in the rapture and i'll skip or maybe you're like spurgeon and says nope i want to do what jesus did i want to die okay it's your choice but three things lord when i'm dying i want to be a", "instead of the focus of everybody else's secondly i want us i want to worship you i want to worship you the day that i die and i want to talk about how you saved me and how you were there at my lowest point of my life and everywhere in between and i want to magnify your my kids and my grandkids and i want to bless them by faith not by sight maybe they're not real spiritual it's not about that it's about your faith in god about what he's going to do in their lives you can a person who doesn't even know the lord and then lord i want to lean right to last moments of my life i want people to see i'm a leaner i know when horseshoes a leaner is is not a ringer but in faith a leaner is a ringer that's all you can right to the end let's have the worship team come and let me pray for us father talking about the day that we die doesn't seem like something very for us today but lord if we're going to live by faith it includes those days weeks months before we actually go home to be with you i pray we would make resolves as best we can that with your help we would be a blessing we would be worshiping we would be trusting right to the end of our our life and i pray god that that would be the blessing not just the words that we speak but the character that we display to our children and our grandchildren that it might help them to live the life in jesus name amen let's all stand and you took on the grave some not even death can't shake us the victor has won in heaven has come now you're taking us you take us you take us high and high and high we're forever changed we've forever at 4 30 this afternoon there will be a a for jeanette coolbaugh who went home to glory yesterday morning and she was the candy lady some of you will remember she always had her bucket of candy to minister to to you she would give out as much of that as she could before service and we are thankful for her life and thankful for the lord taking her home so if you are inclined 4 30 in the courtyard god bless you okay so good when all i see is me walk through is shadow your love there's nothing to fear now foreign oh who can be against me for jesus is not you go before", "nothing can stand against the power a word it will come to pass from the rising sun to the settings there's nothing you can't do your faithfulness faith in jesus my anger to the ground my hope and firm foundation he'll never faith in jesus from the rising sun as you surround me with from my enemies until all my fears and i'm no longer from my mother's womb and i've been born again oh i am and surrounded am surrounded by the arms of the father i am surrounded amen that is a good truth to sing in the children of the living god our god is not dead he is risen he is here he is active and we are heirs to heaven and uh that's that's reason enough you know it says all throughout scripture in the psalms to to shout for joy you know lift up a shot of praise and we can shout for a lot of different things sometimes we misplace our shouts sometimes it's a shot of anger if you're a parent you know and uh or if you drive in riverside on the 91 then you know as well but and sometimes it's a shot of victory because our team won or it's a shot of excitement because you got that check that it was unexpected we get excited about a lot of things but there's nothing to be more excited about the risen king who is here in our midst and uh you know many of you that's just who you are you're just ready you're like shouting all the time you're just excited all the time but some of you if you're like me you're a little bit more stoic i'm the kid that got christmas presents and i would get like the thing that i wanted it was like the the best thing you could ever receive as a christmas present i'd be like hmm that's nice you know and it's not because i wasn't shouting for joy inside it's just i'm just a very stoked person it's like that guy is a little depressed over there no no this is just how my face looks you know and uh so maybe you're one of those people you're just you know you're like a little more more reserved you know you your sacrifice of praise be you know hey i'm gonna be an exaggerated version of who i am on the inside here this morning what does the scripture tell us to do it says encourage one another through psalms hymns and spiritual songs and so yeah we should be glorifying christ we should be laying ourselves on", "the altar we should be singing with nothing held back not as a show of piety or something like that but to say you know he's worth it to encourage one another in worshiping as well because maybe somebody maybe you might see a raymond sitting next to you and he's just like you know and you might to be a little bit more boisterous than and so uh it's a good thing to do in the house of the lord and that goes for you right there who are watching online we want to encourage you in psalms hymns and spiritual songs and so we can do two things at once we can lift up a shot of praise and a your name is not raymond that's good uh we can lift up a shadow praise everybody online is it ready here we go we love you we know you're there and you are joined together in unity albeit a different vicinity and so we're going to transition into a time of right now and so if you're watching online like magic there's the link

the lord and then we're going to sing about what we're about to do here we're hopefully going from one degree of glory to the next degree of glory as we are transformed more into christ's image here this morning and so hopefully this place reflecting his image a little bit more than when you came into this because you spent this time with him so let's pray lord we love you we thank you we're looking forward to worshiping you now giving of our time our talents and our treasure we want to put our heart completely in your hands and say you are the most important thing in this room here this morning so we want to worship you with nothing held back and so give us this opportunity not to be but to really harness all that you have for us here this morning and uh lord take these ties these offerings they're better in your hands than they are in our hands and uh we want our heart to be where our treasure is also and so our heart is with you and we love you we want to hold nothing back on

on the grace so not even death can't shake us the victor has won and heaven has come now you're taking us are you taking us higher oh just the voices let's go awesome awesome you can be seated thank it's nice to have those backgrounds people think that who've never come here that we are calvary cathedral chapel i guess because it's pretty cool what you can do with we have the privilege of dedicating a little guy to the lord so mom or dad will bring up brody yeah yeah it's a good picture come on up here so why do we dedicate children well because the lord commanded it and because the idea is that mom and dad are making a commitment themselves it's it's not this sacrament it's not baptism baptism is for believers but it is a time for a mom and dad to say we are committed to raising our son in this case little brody in the fear and the admonition of the lord remember joshua said at the end of his", "life he said to everybody in israel you guys got to choose whom you're going to serve that's up to you but as for me and my family as for me and my house will what will serve the lord and that's the dedication of the declaration this family is making yeah so let's let's go before the lord's for brody father we know that we're praying for brody but we're praying for we're praying that he would come to know you and that he would see you lived out in mom and dad's life their love for each other their love for him and their faith god said would you strengthen them to not just dedicate in the ceremony but to live it out lord would you help him to know the name jesus first and foremost uh in his own family as lord your name is used in reverence around the table and around the home and when there's needs but lord may he discover that you're the god of his salvation may he come to know you personally at a young age we just dedicate his whole life to you and we thank you for him in jesus name what a cool looking kid huh god bless you guys thank you thank you thank you all right josh come give us right on right on i'm excited to be at church with you guys growing in god's and uh that's exactly what we want to be about here at calvary chapel east anaheim is that we want to enable you equip you and give you an environment that you know god grow in him serve him and share him and we we hope to equip you with that through god's word through the events we do activities and ministry opportunities i have three things that we're doing this coming week and this is ongoing that can help you do those four things number one is our wednesday night service called next step in fact we consider it the in growing in god but also connecting here at calvary chapel to come out to our wednesday night midweek service we study the old testament on wednesday night pastor bob is leading us through the old testament and here on sunday morning it's the new it's kind of the next step there as well as a way to get deeper into fellowship it's a smaller service more intimate setting in fact we even serve dinner beforehand starting at five o'clock this week we have chicken tacos and we fellowship in the meet more people we have the whole nine children's ministry spanish ministry and", "even youth ministry so if you want to be a part of that come out any wednesday night at 7 00 p.m and we'd love to have you here right here in the sanctuary going through the old testament we also have some home bible studies another way you can know god grow in him even more we have openings on a tuesday night and thursday night bible study so they've been ongoing already this is not a new bible study these are ongoing bible studies but now there's some open spots that we'd love to plug you into so if you are interested you can email our young adult pastor pastor ryan young his email is in the bulletin so you know that paper that we diligently give you that's in there so checking out the bulletin and there's his info as well as some other info as well finally we have a church directory that we want you to know about uh two things number one i think there's a it is an app you download in addition to our cal reach apple app so if you don't have the calorie chapel app i encourage you to do it look up ccea or east anaheim on your app store or google google play and download that app but in addition to that if you want to access our instant church directory you need to go on the same and look up instant church directory and download that app and there'll be some instructions that will lead you through that get you to using our directory you put in our calorie chatbot each anaheim name and then you can view our directory so get that if you don't have that already i don't know about you but i've never have you ever walked down the hall and you see someone like they're facing know but i forgot their name like you want this on them like we're in the youth we have everyone put this on because i'm terrible at that i'm like brother what's up right it's like but if you want to get past just calling each everyone brother dude bro whatever um because this app is a really great way to put a name to that face because we have pictures in there as well and if you're not a part of it you can do so pretty easily go to our calorie chapel app if you scroll down to the bottom of it we have a little example here on the screens for you if you scroll down to the bottom it says instant church directory hit that fill out your information for your first", "name your last name some details about your photo up there if you'd like to as well and then you'll be put into the directory along with all our pastors i'm in there a lot of our churches in there so it's a great way to be a part connect and also when you have that moment that i was describing earlier you can whip out your phone and figure it out also if you're already a part of the directory we want to know you're still here so go to that same spot on the top instead of saying i'm new here put on there confirm that way we know you're still around and we'll keep you in in the coming updates of the app so that is all the let's get into god's word thanks josh by the way i'm i'm really grateful to start to see people coming back uh on sunday mornings and wednesday nights so if you are recently back we we don't want to you know identify you other than to say thank you we realize and there's others that are still at home and i'm i'm praying for everybody who is holding back um if you you know if you feel you need to stay back we get that we we want you to be sensitive to the lord but my prayer is that everybody's back by good friday and easter this year which is around the corner you know they're saying some are saying that the wall street journal that uh they believe our nation may have heard immunity as early as april and uh i don't know about hurt immunity i believe in flock immunity so i'm praying that god blesses us with that but i hope you online will find your way back we miss you and we're looking forward to you being with us uh open your bibles to hebrews chapter 11 if you would hebrews 11 we're going verse by verse and literally verse by verse because we're only doing one verse today uh at a time but hebrews chapter 11 verse 21 simply says this by faith jacob as he was dying blessed each of the sons of joseph so those would be and he worshipped leaning on the top of let's pray father would you give us we want to live by faith we know that we came into eternal life by believing your word and now this life is about walking by faith and at some if you don't take us in the rapture we're going to go through this time of dying and lord it's hard for us", "to think about that we don't like to think about it even though we know you've conquered it and we're going to but lord it's part of our life that we want to know how to live by faith and die by faith so would you encourage us for this example of jacob in jesus name i pray amen you can be seated it was charles hadn't spurgeon who said this he said god is greatly glorified when his people leave this world with their flags flying at full mast in other words that those have come to the lord are actually believing strongly in the lord at the end of their life hebrews 11 is the record of old testament saints who lived by faith or in some cases died by faith in fact samson will wind up in the list later he kind of didn't live a lot of faith most of his life but at the very very very end his last decision was one of faith and so he gets in to the list but here we're studying the that's abraham isaac jacob and joseph and we are now on the life of jacob and of course if you know your old testament many of you do or if you've been coming on wednesday nights we've been studying these men in their lives 12 chapters are to the life of jacob jacob was a twin he was remember the younger of two there was esau and jacob who were born to isaac and rebecca and so now we have jacob at his death bed and we are told that he blessed not just children but his grandchildren and many in here like me you have grandkids and you want to be a blessing to your but maybe you're not sure how we've talked already if you weren't here about how to bless your children and how isaac is an example of that because he blessed his kids he thought he was dying he still had 50 years to but isaac was dying for a long time some people they die for years before they die you know and he just was sure he was about to go and he wasn't but it's never too soon to put a blessing on your children but here we have something more we have jacob blessing in essence his through blessing joseph's sons it's a very unique story and to kind of give you the background the problem is i know i only have one verse you say how can you talk so long on one verse and you go i know you you can do it", "hebrews 11 21 you could tie a thread back to genesis 48 verses 1 through 21 because that's the background of the story and we don't have time to read the whole chapter so i'm going to kind of try my best to summarize it we go back now in the old testament to the time and his family have moved to egypt joseph is now ruling under pharaoh remember god has exalted joseph to that place of overseeing the years of the famine and so he brings his family to in goshen and while jacob is there after 17 years of being there it comes to his time to die and so word is given to joseph hey your is sick and so joseph brings his two sons joseph's two sons that's and ephraim two boys two young boys by by the way they are born egyptian their mother's an egyptian and they had always lived in egypt so don't picture them as good little jewish boys they are probably pretty much a part of the egyptian culture although their dad is but joseph brings his sons to his dying father's bedside and jacob at this is so sick he is bed bound and he seeing his son joseph he's blown away because he remember thought his son was dead and he loves seeing his son but it's his time to die and he tells joseph and these two little boys god has my life and now i want to pronounce a on your life joseph and actually he does something very interesting he says to joseph your two sons manasse and ephraim they're mine i'm claiming them as my own they are going to be the ones as though they were i'm putting your blessing joseph on your and actually there is a tribe of ephraim there is a tribe of manasseh as you know they call them the half-tribes but it's very interesting what joseph decides to do and so he takes these little boys manasse and ephraim he kisses them he and joseph sees that dad's about to pronounce a blessing and this is the part of the story you may remember so joseph the dad takes manasseh the the firstborn and he puts him toward his father's right hand so that his right hand will be on the first born son and he takes ephraim the younger and he puts him toward his dad's left hand before dad gives the blessing and so dad reaches out and does one of these and puts his right hand on the younger boys you know and and by the way by this time jacob is already", "losing his eyesight he's virtually blind joseph thinks you made a mistake dad you put your right hand and you blessed the you know the the first is most of us and he goes now i know exactly what i'm because you see he was blessing those grandkids by faith not by sight and he had a word to speak over their future it's a fascinating story i commend it to you to read but let me just read to you part of what jacob said as he's meeting joseph and his sons it says in verse 15 he jacob blessed joseph that's and he said the god before whom my fathers abraham and isaac walked the god who has been my shepherd all my life to this day the angel who has redeemed me from all the lads these two little guys and may live on in them and the names of my fathers abraham and isaac and may they grow into a multitude in of the earth and then it says in verse 20 he blessed them that day saying by you menacing ephraim by you nation of israel will pronounce blessings saying may god make you like ephraim and manasseh thus jacob put ephraim before manasseh then israel or jacob said to i'm about to die but god will be with you and bring you back to the land of your fathers they are in egypt there's no plan to leave anytime soon but he's saying may god bless you and bring you back to the land of canaan which god has promised so we're talking here in hebrews 11 what we're calling profiles these biography stories given in a verse that tell a story about somebody that's in god's book somebody who he considers a man of great faith and now we're talking about not just living by faith making decisions like enoch walked with god by faith abel worshipped by faith remember noah built the ark by faith all those years abraham lived by faith but now we're talking about that slice of where you're dying where you're getting ready to go and will that be a time that your and your grandchildren and the people around you your spouse will be blessed by you so there are three words they're not on your outline you can just write them down freehand this is outside the box just write these three words out because if you get nothing else it's important from our text that you don't miss this in verse 21 there are three things that were involved in dying and faith one put down the word blessing you want to", "give a blessing you want to be a that's what a person who dies in faith secondly worship because it tells us in the text he worshipped by faith when he was dying he's still thirdly he was leaning on top of his staff and that one sounds kind of weird it's like what do i care if he had a walker you know i mean it just what's what's that we'll get to that and why so three aspects of dying in faith i put into the word first of all finish have a faith if you're taking notes letter a have a faith that is strong to finish paul put it this way he said at the end of his life second timothy the last thing that he ever wrote i have finished the course i have fought the fight i have kept the faith that's got to be one of the most important things that the writer of hebrews is trying to get across to the people he's writing to you claimed to know christ you gave your life to christ you said when he died on the cross he died for you but now you're to go back to religion to go back to your own efforts to go back to the and he's encouraging them by looking at these men and women of faith of the old testament say look they lived by faith but they also died by faith they kept right to the end why because in chapter 12 he's about to say guess what jesus is our prime example all these people lived they weren't perfect but they died in faith they lived in faith but jesus fix your eyes on jesus the author and the perfecter of faith who endured the cross you'll see and so being looked at all these men and women of the old testament lived in faith it's filling the angel stadium and they're cheering you on in your race as you're running the race of faith and their lives become a testimony that's why we're calling it a profile in faith so put this down your dying days is the last chance to your faith you think about it the last words that you'll speak on this earth i don't know what they'll be obviously none of us really know what our last words will be it might be go this hurts i don't know i mean you know i i'm kind of a connoisseur of last words i study different people's last words because there are some people who have said some interesting things at the end of their life pancho", "mexican general of the revolution days pancho villa's last words that are don't let it end this way tell them that i said something we don't have a clue what it was he said because whoever he told didn't bother to don't let it in this way tell them that i said something um though that's disputed but supposedly he said that but something that's not disputed grover cleveland reading's last words were quote i have something to say but not at this and then they executed him so he never kind of funny but i think about jacob's last words that's what we're studying his last words were to his family his last words were to joseph and to his grandsons manasseh nephriam and then one more chapter he had a lot and actually chapter 49 is him pronouncing a prophetic blessing on each of his sons and then at the end of the blessing he gets into bed and he breathes his last it's like okay i'm done i'm gonna go and he checks out that's the way he ends his life very he ends his life blessing his children and then he goes to be with the lord and of course you know when we think about jacob jacob has a rich colorful life we can't tell the whole story but he doesn't exactly start out walking with the lord he starts out he's kind of a rip-off con artist from the beginning in fact the story of jacob after we are introduced that his mother is pregnant is that she's having trouble in and jacob and esau who are twins in the womb evidently are struggling and god said because because rebecca says i don't know why if this is pregnancies from the lord why am i having a hard time and and so they seek the lord and god says the reason you're having such a hard he says there are two nations in your womb well that would that would be that would be it you know uh and they're fighting each other already before they even get out they're already at each other's throats some of you have kids that are too close that age and okay well they did not get along from well before day one and so when esau is born he's the jacob comes out holding his what his that's why his name is jacob or yakov which simply means heel catcher you were hanging on to your to try to pull him back so you could be first is the idea and from the beginning of his life he's this guy who takes advantage of other", "the word could mean yaakov a supplanter one who takes advantage when the very first movie of me was before they had uh sound movies and there's this old i haven't seen it yet but i remember seeing it it's me as a little guy just starting to walk and i was i don't know in a park or somewhere and i'm in diapers and i'm starting to walk and my grandfather thought it was cute he was reaching out grabbing my ankle so i would fall down child abuse but anyway i would stand up i started like he popped everybody thought that was funny i don't think i thought it was funny still scarred to the state but anyway that's the idea you're taking advantage of somebody causing them to fall for whatever because you're sick anyway the idea is jacob has that nature that he's born with and it's his character but by the end of things have really changed or the story of a a man who died he finds himself in front of the pearly gates of heaven and in front of them stands an angel and the man approaches the angel greets him and asks the man if he had received christ as lord and savior when he was alive on earth he the angel then checks his records and says great your name is in the book and you'll you're getting into the angel said but now let's talk about he said okay he said well i have a question for you were you a generous man he said what do you mean he said well did you give money to the poor he said no he said how about some charities he the angel said well that's not good he said well did you do any good deeds like what he goes well did you help your neighbors anything he said no and the angel was becoming concerned he finally said look everybody does something nice for someone work with me on this i'm trying to help you you know the man says well there there this old lady that you know i came out of a store and i found her surrounded by a dozen they had taken her purse they were shoving her around and taunting and i got so mad i threw my bags down i fought through the crowd got her purse back then i helped her to her feet and i went up to the biggest baddest biker and i told him that's despicable and cowardly and the angel says wow that's actually very impressive he said when did this happen he said about 10", "that's how he got anyway okay why do i tell you the joke because i like telling because of what javert mcgee says about verse listen to what jay vernon mcgee was on his deathbed and this is the in his life you can lift out of his life by faith jacob did something in other words most of his life you can't use in but this thing you could use it's the last one thing that gets into the book and i find that means this like somebody texted me after i haven't even read the whole text yet but i it's a friend of mine who goes there he says you know i've been a jacob my whole life and maybe you could relate more to jacob than you can to who he became jacob's real name becomes what israel god changes it to israel we'll talk about that but maybe you feel like i'm a christian i believe i know the lord but out for myself in so many ways and maybe you feel like i want my character to change he's a study you i don't care how long you've lived as a jacob you can end your story as an israel you can end your story as one who is in god but it's your last chance to demonstrate your faith to your family put this down make your departure a say lord i when i go i wanted to bless people not because i go but before i go shot down luke 24 verses 50 through 53 jesus led his disciples out as far as he lifted up his hands and he blessed while he was blessing them he parted and was carried up into heaven and they we started worshiping him and they returned to jerusalem with great joy and we're continually in the temple praising interesting the day jesus departs he leaves a blessing in the air and that's exactly what jacob is going to do you say well jesus had already died but think about him on the don't tell me he didn't leave any blessings that day because i think there was a thief that originally was putting him down who came to faith and said today you'll be with me in paradise i think there were some people that killed him who he said father forgive them they know not what they do i think there was a mother who was wondering life would be after her son was dead and a disciple who might wonder what is my life going to be after my master is dead and he was caring for them from the", "cross don't think jesus to leave a blessing in the air from the cross because he did question isn't did he the question is the fact is most of us are not at our when we're dying i mean if you think about it ecclesiastes says remember your creator in the days of your youth before the evil days come when you will say i take no delight in them what's that that's your old age when you just are getting you know sicker and more miserable and fruits of the spirit are one of those um but it's interesting we have jacob and according to the bible he was sick he was weak he was dead bound jot down genesis 48 verses 2 through 4 genesis 48 2 through four says this when it was told to jacob behold your son and uh your son joseph has come to you israel that is jacob collected his strength sat up in the bed said to joseph god almighty appeared to at luz in the land of canaan and he and he said to me behold i will make you fruitful and numerous and i will make you a company of peoples and i'll give this land to your descendants after you for an everlasting then genesis 48 verse 7. he said now as for me when i came from padan rachel died to my sorrow in the land of canaan on the journey when there was still some distance to go to ephrath and i buried her there on the way to ephrath that is bethlehem here's what i want you to see when he begins to pronounce a blessing it starts with those verses it's not just his putting his hands on the kids and speaking it's what he said even before that to joseph in front of those boys here's what he mentions two things out of his life you might say the first thing that he mentions is his testimony the first thing he mentioned is the day he met the lord when he's running for his life from esau because he saw his brother said i'm gonna kill you oh i'm gonna kill you and so he runs while he's running he stops to spend the night in a village called luz later called bethel house of god for the first time at by the way the age jacob has a dream and in the dream he sees what we call jacob's ladder god speaks to him and he says the covenant that i had with your father and your grandfather i'm giving to you and he blesses jacob with these promises", "i'm gonna give you this land i'm gonna bring you back and he doesn't mention anything about his sin it's incredible what happens and the that jacob wants to say to bless his son and his grandchildren is let me tell you my story and i i gotta and ask you do your kids know your have you ever shared it with you do your grandchildren no here's one of the big mistakes christians make they have a relationship with kids maybe after you got saved they've only known you as a christian now i'm not saying be proud of the fact that you were worldly but do they know that you weren't always a christian because when people say i've always been a christian i was raised a christian i have to wonder if they've ever been one because jesus said except you be you cannot enter the kingdom of god it's important that we bless our kids and our grandkids by telling them our story and so jacob begins by telling him that was the day it was a long time ago 70 years ago but i met the lord and then he talks about one other issue on his journey and by the way this would have been one of the lowest points he talks about when rachel his beloved wife remember he was in love with rachel he gets the twofer he gets leah thrown in he didn't plan to marry her but he giving birth to their youngest son benjamin which should have been a moment of great joy and expectation for rachel and and for jacob but she dies she dies to this baby names him son of my sorrow horrible day and by the way you know who jacob is telling the story to joseph by the way joseph was there he was 13 the day his mama died don't think this didn't bring up a ton of memories for joseph as well why is jacob telling the story because god has lived out in jacob's life his there in that dream i am with you i will keep you wherever you go and i will never leave you nor forsake you you'll let people leave you because they don't like you you'll have other people who love you who will be taken home there's no guarantee on anybody in your life that they're going to be there until the day you die except god and this is what he's saying he calls him el shaddai god almighty he begins by just talking about what a life that he's lived but he is blessing and his son by telling him his story", "i love the songs that have been written that include testimonies i think sometimes we think of the great hymns that they're just all theology there's a lot of good theology in the hymns back in the 18th century john wesley you're familiar with his revivals we think of the methodist church's roots john was kicked out of the anglican church and he just preached on the in the outside he they wouldn't let him in no pulpit would allow him in but he'd go he said the world is my parish the world is my church because i they won't let me in there so he'd go out he'd preach people would get saved and charles wesley his brother also involved with that ministry also a incredible hymn writer many of the great hymns were written by charles one of the great hymns written by charles wesley was written when he was 30 years old as he was approaching may considered a certain day in may that'd be the day he was born again so he was coming up on his spiritual birthday and he wrote a famous hymn that some of us grew up singing and can it be and the third stanza while the first two are great theology the third one is very personal here's the words maybe you know these words he said long my imprisoned spirit lay fast bound in sin and nature's night thine eye defused a quickening ray i woke the dungeon flamed with light please get the background this is coming right from the book of acts peter remember who's going to be executed in the middle of the night god sends an angel the lights get turned on this is charles wesley is using the background of what luke wrote about peter i woke the dungeon flamed with light my chains fell off my heart was free i rose went forth and followed thee amazing love how can it be that thou my god should die for me it's it's charles wesley's testimony jim peterson in 1961 was at a bible college conference in pennsylvania old guy named jim got up and was sharing a testimony and during that testimony he said these words he said when i got saved he was an old guy now but he said when i got saved it was like heaven came down and glory filled my soul and jim peterson immediately knew the words of the song he wanted to write heaven came down and glory filled my soul you see when at the cross the savior made me whole my sins were washed away my night was turned today", "heaven came down it's his story it's his can i just ask you again have you shared your testimony with your spouse have you ever shared your testimony with your do you know that passover is proof that god wants every generation to tell another generation how they got saved he requires it the law tell them what i and i think it's so important if you want to bless your kids it's not just saying words over them oh i hope you have a good life and i hope you do really well in life that's not the blessing the blessing is being the blessing and telling them in part what the lord has done in your life put this down bless your children's children the fact is while isaac blessed esau and jacob his children his sons jacob is blessing his grandchildren now i know some of you are going well i have grandchildren but i don't know him i don't know him very well maybe you don't have the privilege of living close to him maybe you've never known i didn't know my grandparents growing up and it would it's probably feel strange for them to come pronounce a blessing over my life but can i remind you of something that should take away every excuse it's genesis 48 verses 8 and 9 jot it down genesis 48 verses 8 9 when israel or jacob saw joseph's sons who are they now he's blind but please understand he doesn't know them he's never met them this is the day he's meeting them joseph said to his dad uh they're my kids they're my sons whom god has given me so he said bring them to me please that may bless them i don't think we can use as an excuse i don't know my grandkids very well i certainly can't pronounce a that's not true the only way maybe some of us can bless our grandchildren is by we don't know them we don't know anything about them it's going to be by faith not because you know all about by the way if you want to bless a parent bless their kids you want to bless me let me know the characteristics of christ that you've seen in my sons and it'll bless me and the same thing is true if you want to be a blessing to son and daughter and they have children your son or daughter by sharing what you see if you do see or speaking a word by faith about the kids he says my name will live in them what does that mean well what is", "jacob's name given by god israel what does israel mean it means god governed may your sons live out god government yeah they were born in egypt yeah their mother's egyptian yeah they wear egyptian clothes they've only been in egypt their whole life but they're part of the family of god they're part of the children of israel in fact you know what he says he says your sons they're mine they are mine and i'm going to bless them as though they were to me and my wife and he says also may the names of their grandfather great-grandfather and great-great-grandfather abraham and isaac live in them abraham's name was father of a multitude may they be blessed and be fruitful big families because they're going to become heads of tribes you see manasseh will be the head of the tribe of manasseh and ephraim the head of the tribe of ephraim in fact ephraim will become the name that they use to speak of israel it's one of the epithets for calling all of israel all through the old testament it's fascinating and he's saying may they have the name of isaac on them that brings people joy that's what i want for them well put this down letter b not only did he but he worship put in the word worship bless them as they watch you worship you know i i don't know uh your relationship with your parents but if i could share just briefly about mine i was i'm the youngest of five we were taken to church as early as i can remember so i was raised in church it was a lutheran church here in placentia and uh mike we really did we went religiously we didn't have a choice we and uh i didn't complain i was just part of the family and so i believed in god but i didn't know the lord but i learned a lot about god every sunday because of the nicene creed and the apostles creed that are recited there and the hymns and all sunday school but for me it was pretty much a dead religious kind of experience i didn't get much out of it i didn't like going if i had a choice i would stay home pretend i was sick you that didn't work very often i tried to do it every week didn't work take the thermometer yeah okay so we've done those things but i remember one moment from a church service and all those years that i went that i can never forget i'm sitting in a pew next to my dad and", "the rest of my family i don't know what the hymn was might have been onward christian soldiers they used to sing that could have been one of 20 other hymns in the hymn hymnbook but i do remember for some reason i looked up at my dad i was probably seven and whatever it was that he was singing in that song his eyes got full of tears and you got know something about my dad my dad did not cry i never saw my dad cry ever he wasn't emotional he was very stoic he was a genius he was brilliant very intellectual but he didn't emote and i was like wow whatever he's singing he really believes it matters to him that spoke more to my little life than anything i learned at that church my father whom i love my father who's by example he believes in his god can i tell you something the fact that worshipped before them he didn't turn on some cd and start singing you know songs that he liked that's not what he did he worshipped the lord and the way that he did that all through genesis 48 was frankly by talking about his god he focused on the lord and i want you to first of all put this down leave a blessing in the air when you leave that's the idea and by the way you might say what do you mean well talk more about the lord jacob wasn't always somebody who praised the even as a believer in fact god will change his name from jacob to israel and we'll talk about that but he was a lot the bible calls him jacob a bunch even though his name is israel except on this day in genesis 48 he is israel israel it's seven times right in a row he's all israel he's all governed by god it's very not always like that um there's an place in the book of genesis where he is to meet pharaoh jacob old man has come to egypt to live in the land of joseph has made provision for his dad and his brothers and their flocks and and pharaoh wants to meet joseph's father now mind you joseph has impressed pharaoh he has saved the whole nation right i mean he is the savior of the world literally he's the type of christ savior of the world and savior of the jews by the way it's very interesting but so pharaoh says i want to meet your dad i mean i'm impressed with you i can't wait to meet your dad right well it's", "finally jacob who's old meets pharaoh who's the king of the world you think what an opportunity to be a witness right i mean that's your one moment in life to influence somebody who has power like that jot it down it's genesis 47 verses 8 pharaoh this is the interaction between them pharaoh says to jacob how many years have you lived in other words how old are you so jacob said to pharaoh the years of my sojourning are 130 130 years old but then he describes his life few and unpleasant have been the years of my nor have they attained to the years of my fathers who lived out their days of their sojourning and then it says and jacob blessed and he went out from his presence frankly i think he blessed him by going out of his presence it's like he meets him how old are you i'm 100 instead of going god's been great he's been all these things that he's doing on the last day he's like oh no he's just complaining he's like a total er yeah i've lived a long time it's been a really miserable life by the way if i think about my dad or my grandmother they lived way longer than do goodbye um my point is that he wasn't always somebody that was a blessing to be around but at the end of his life last day of his life he's not really self-focused at all he's not complaining he's not comparing himself with somebody else he is just blessing the lord so put this down speak less of yourself speak less of thee and more heard of this guy he went to visit on the east coast two huge churches super churches big churches back in the day when it was all radio and and these two had their churches back there and he said i'm going to go visit those churches if i can to a christian friend this christian friend said oh man tell me what you think so he came back he said did you get to visit the two jerseys he said i did he said so what did you think about him he said what did i think about him he said well pastor so and so the first one he goes he is an amazing preacher he said but pastor so and so the other one he has an amazing savior and what jacob does on this last day he just talks about the lord repeatedly all through so i want to just give you the fillings we'll go through he is god is merciful and gracious", "he talks about how when god met him there in luz he was running from the consequences of his sins but god didn't blast him about his sin he blessed him in spite of his sins so put him merciful he says he gives he has given him a hope and a future remember when he meets the lord there in bethel or luz he only has a staff he's broke he's alone his future is completely uncertain but god tells them i'm going to bless you i'm going to make you numerous i'm going to bring you back here oh god starts on kind of just telling him all the things he has planned for him put this down he is my family restorer why do i say that because do you know what happens to jacob he's in canaan joseph is with his brothers when they're coming for grain and he says you need to go get my dad you need to bring he's an old man he goes bring him here and uh tell him i'm alive because they they just learned that their their brother is alive they don't even know he's alive remember they had lied they had tried to you know they sold them as a slave and then as far as they knew he was dead now they've discovered that the king of egypt's right-hand man is their brother that's kind of a big problem and so they work through that and joseph says you meant it for evil god meant it for good now go get my dad there's several more years of this famine he can't stay in canaan he needs to come even though he's an old man bring everything we'll send we'll send the the vans pharaoh's going to pay for it all bring him here leave everything behind just come we're going to put you in put you up in the best of the land and so the word comes back to jacob who thinks his son has been dead for years and the word is by the way you know that son that you were sure was dead we showed you the bloody you know from the animals yeah that didn't really quite happen that way uh he somehow made it out and uh yeah he's alive and hey she's ruling the world by the way eddie wants you to come it's like what he was blown away as you can only imagine and what he said was it's enough that my son joseph is alive i will go to egypt so that i can see his and die a happy man basically it's kind", "of the story of simeon in the new testament when mary and joseph come in and hand them jesus and he says now lord thou hast let thy servant depart in peace according to your word for mine eyes have seen the salvation of israel that you prepared in other words god i've been waiting for this moment to to see the savior and now i have and i'm good to go jacob says i can't even believe it but and he relocates to egypt and he is seeing his son and he is blown away at god's redemption in his life but it wasn't just to restore his son you know it's kind of jacob has the testimony of the father with the prodigal my son was dead and now he's alive i did not i blown away he's he's like he's alive from the dead joseph is a type of christ i'm telling you it's an incredible study but exceedingly abundantly beyond he says i not only get to see your face i see your children's children he says this is more than i ever even imagined was possible god has restored my family and maybe you have that testimony or maybe god wants to give you that testimony by the end of your life that he's pulled your family back together that those maybe who are dead spiritually are going to come alive and it's going to be part of your put this down he is my faithful shepherd he winds up saying in chapter 48 the god before whom my father and grandfather has been my shepherd sounds like psalm he has been my shepherd my whole life until now now that's he meets the lord at 77 but he is now looking by faith back before he met the lord to the time of his birth and he's saying you know what lord you are guiding me you are protecting me you are taking care of me all the way i didn't see it then pastor chuck in his autobiography uses the phrase over and over again i've learned that everything is preparation for something else everything i've gone through was always preparation for something else sometimes we got to get a little older of the lord to look back and to see what god was doing because sometimes well i wasn't doing nothing well i got saved oh you're wrong remember he predestined you before the foundation of the world he was thinking about a long time ago you were his from the moment you were and he was working in your life to bring you to a place where you would bow the", "knee to him so maybe you don't realize he was shepherded in your life but here by faith he says you know what he actually was watching over me the time you know what god told his people in deuteronomy by the way deuteronomy deutero it means second anamas is greek for law it's the second giving of the law it's the end of the days of moses and he is rehearsing to them god's law and it's very interesting what he says to them in deuteronomy 8 2 he said you shall remember all the way which the lord your has led you in the wilderness in other words as you end your journey don't forget the whole journey and what he has done for you you know i remember when i had to leave police work uh on pardon me when i had to leave the ministry i was in the ministry full time and i had to leave to go back into law enforcement and i didn't want to a lot of you know my story i went back to as a cop in placentia but it was the last thing i wanted to do i had already been through bible college in seminary i was on staff at a church this was my calling and i knew it but but god was making it very clear he wanted me to to leave the ministry and i didn't have a clue why but i know if it wasn't for him sending me back to police work i wouldn't be here you wouldn't be here i guarantee you the reason he put me back in the police work was so this church could be born in my because the chief of police was chuck smith's one of the elders at his church to encourage me to start a church it would have never happened but at the moment i couldn't see it you see hindsight is 20 20. foresight is blind as a bat we don't see what god is doing right now but looking back he said you know what now that i look at it he was shepherding me the whole way even when you brothers tried to rip me off and kill me god was in charge of that you meant it for evil god meant it for good you see you can see the hand of god in your past but many times it's far enough in your past and then put it down the word redeemer he is my powerful redeemer in other words it's true he would have said i i did rip off esau of his birthright with that bowl of", "soup i did commit identity theft when i dressed up as harry to deceive my father it's true i was afraid and i skipped out on laban when he was out shearing his sheep so i didn't have to deal with him and i i didn't honor him it is true that when i knew esau was coming with all those men i tried to figure out for myself how to outwit him by sending those gifts on ahead and trying to placate him and then dividing the family up and setting him aside because he can't attack us all see jacob was always always always doing stuff in the power of the flesh always struggling that way but god has from all of my sin and then he is our he says this in 48 21 behold i die but god i love it but i die but god will be with you and bring you back to the in other words i know god still has a plan for you and i can't live forever but god can't die ever so guess what he's the everlasting god and he is my god and he's your god and he will be with you whatever might come your way so he worships the lord how by declaring character that's what we do when we worship the lord we're reminding ourselves rehearsing to ourselves and to others who our god is and then put this down and learn to lean learn to lean because it says he died by faith first because he was blessing his kids when he died second because he worshipped before them but then it says he was leaning on the top of his staff so what's the significance of that well you know i remember when my kids came home from school they were just a school you know elementary school and one of them said dad i got a joke for you i said what is that he said what do you call a cow with no legs i don't know i said ground beef and then i think you said and what do you call a lady with one leg i don't know i lean i tried to laugh i saved it for you put this down at the end of your life make it clear you are still leaning why do i say that because one of the most basic principles for a christian so basically they used to print it on the bottom of the out in and out cups is proverbs 3 verses 5 and 6. and most of you have heard it or", "trust in the lord with all your heart lean not on what your own understanding in all your ways acknowledge him he'll make your path straighter here's the idea for a christian we have leaning we've been living based on our our whole life that's what people do the problem is we come to faith in jesus we know he died for us he saved us he wants to be the lord of our life take my upon you let me steer your life yes lord do that but i don't understand so i'm not going to really follow you because if unless i can understand what you're we still struggle with proverbs you don't outgrow proverbs 3 5. when you think i've got that you have got it i know lee not now you say well what does that have to do with jacob a whole lot more maybe than you think jacob was a leaner on himself from from the time he has his brother's foot in the womb throughout most of his life he is jacob he is the heel catcher he is the looking out for number one self-assertive oh boy was he self-assertive go read about when he meets rachel if you don't think he was incredibly brash inc incredibly arrogant uh in the in coming up for the watering of the sheep and and then laban uh says well i'll give you a job what should i pay you goes by what yeah he he is extremely bold and he's he uses for instance pagan to get god to bless him you know uh if i have the phlox reproducing at the water troughs and i have these poplar branches that are striped my deal with labans i get all the striped offspring which aren't very many but if i strip the poplar branches down i believe that it's going to cause them striped animals and god allows it to happen but not because of the superstition because god's gonna bless him in spite of his lack of faith oh no he's always out for he's he's trying to outwit laban um and you know he's really up until the injures him he is trusting in himself now i want you to jot down verses 24 through 32 because i want to read it just in case you don't know this part of the bible because i think it is life-changing moment in jacob's life and maybe you've had one of these or you have one yet in your future listen to what it says now this is by the way when esau is coming with his men", "esau has said i'm going to kill you he's afraid he's going to die and he has separated his family so if jacob attacks one group he can't attack and he's left alone this is what it says was left alone that night and a man wrestled with him until daybreak we know from hosea another passage this is the angel of the lord but he just thinks it's a guy a man probably somebody from esau's camp he doesn't know but he's fighting when he saw that he had not prevailed he the angel touched the socket of his thigh so the socket of jacob's thigh was while he wrestled with him then he said let me go for the dawn is breaking the angel said but he said this is jacob now i will not let unless you bless me so he said to him what's your name and he said he'll catch jacob and he said your name will no jacob yaakov by israel which means god governed for you have striven wrestled with god you've been wrestling your whole life you wrestled with your brother when you were a kid you wrestled with your dad to get his love you wrestled with your boss laban you that's what you do you wrestle your own way through it and now you don't even realize it but you have been wrestling with god your whole and now god's opened your eyes you thought you could beat this guy this guy just some other guy it was god himself showing you can't beat him and finally you get defeated and in your defeat you surrender this is what's happening jacob is realizing i can't fight god what did gamaliel say to the sanhedrin if what these guys are preaching is of man it won't last here's peter james and john basically saying if if this gospel is of man it'll always does gave some historical examples of other leaders who have lit you know they're all dead but he said if this is of god you might be found to be fighting and in fact that's exactly what was the and maybe you're a person you've been fighting god you didn't recognize it was god but you've been fighting him jacob the wrestler is broken his hip is broken then jacob asked him and said please tell me your name and he said why is it that you asked my name and he blessed him there so jacob named the pineal for he said i have seen god face to face yet my life has been preserved now the sun rose upon him", "just as he crossed over penul is what says he was limping on his thigh therefore to this day the sons of israel don't even eat the sinew of the hip which is on the socket of the thigh because he touched the socket of jacob's thigh and the sinew in other words they would honor this day to say we don't even eat that part of the animal because that's holy that's where god our forefather that's that's what it took to change jacob's character in his life it's very interesting passage of scripture because he gets his new name when he accepts defeat before the lord and surrenders to god he's just hanging now to the angel saying bless me i know you're the source of blessing you're not very very interesting and so you might say this the idea is that your children and your would not just hear your testimony of how you got saved 70 years ago jacob but they would see you still worship that god for who he's been in your life and to the very moment to your very last breath you're not leaning on your own understanding but you're a person who has learned to lean every step because from that moment that crippled he never got healed god could have healed him remember what paul said i had a thorn in the flesh a messenger from satan i prayed three times god take it from me and god said my grace is sufficient i've given you that to keep you humble so you're going to have it till the day you die paul jacob you're going to have that injury to the day you die why so you never try to put your weight down on your own feet again so the day you die you'll be leaning let your children let your grandchildren see that right up to the moment that you die you're still trusting the lord and then put this down put in the word leaving at the end let them see you're ready to be leaving why do i say that because this was a pilgrim staff this was the staff that is used for a and as he's dying he's leaning on a staff it'd be like you're dying with your car keys in your hand wait wait where are you going where are you i'm ready to go by the way jacob will give commands to joseph and to the children of israel when you guys leave egypt i know it's not today i know it's going to be a long time from now you take my bones with you", "we'll read about joseph doing that but actually jacob did it first he said you keep my bones and you bury them back and shuck them in the promised land i know my future is somewhere else god's got a plan for my future he's made promises and so he dies in faith he's leaning on his staff saying i'm i'm ready to go do you know god told hezekiah you're going to die now god doesn't give us all that we don't know when i mean we might start to go okay it's coming out you can kind of tell it might now you know soon but god did tell king hezekiah it's time to die set your house what does that mean well the word house beth in hebrew bait means family not just your physical family affairs get your family set up now you might means make sure they're provided for financially make sure you have a place for them to know what to do with you after you die so they'll have to just figure it out might include that but it probably has to do with make sure the relationships in your family are healthy get your family ready for you to if you're a parent get your kids ready to be able to live without you but to understand where you're going part of this is the blessing you put on them is there some unresolved hurt in your family some regrets you have that has never been some unforgiveness it's been said when it comes time to die make sure that's all you have to do there's not some things that never got set your house in order and when jacob is dying he's leaning on his staff because he's ready to go and you ought to be ready to go as well now i want to close with the fact that there's this crossing of the hands it's fascinating joseph doesn't even understand joseph's a godly man but he doesn't understand his dad crossing his putting the blessing of the firstborn on the second birth by faith i hope you see the picture the first born all through the bible is jesus christ he is the firstborn from the dead he is god's firstborn preeminent book of colossians is all about that theme he has come to take first place in everything the blessing of the firstborn god wants it on the second birth are you if you've been born again this is ephesians 1 3. every blessing that's in the heavenlies is yours in christ jesus you see here's what peter says in first peter 3", "you and about me let me just read it you have been called for this very purpose that you might listen to me a blessing not merit a blessing inherit a blessing the final scene in that movie saving private ryan which many of you have seen some of you may it's a world war ii movie based on somewhat true story about a young man who's a soldier named james ryan who had brothers that died during ii and the army finds out that mom only has one son left does not want him to die on the so sends a group of soldiers under captain miller played by tom hanks to go there in normandy france i mean it's tough to do and they find i find this the soldier named ryan james ryan but it's the wrong one they're losing some of their team getting killed in the process and captain miller says this this ryan that we're going to find he better be worth it he better go home and cure some disease or invent a longer lasting light bulb or can't see why one young man's life would be worth all these other people may be and one by one they do the final scenes of that movie show captain miller who's been shot and wounded and is going to die on a bridge and he's gasping for air and private ryan who the right one matt damon who they found comes up to him and he's crying tanks all around bullets flying and captain miller with all that it's looks at james ryan and says earn this it and ryan stands up and they magically his face to a fast forward to a later time in his life where he's back in normandy with his wife his children and their children and they're standing in front of a white cross of fields of of white crosses where american soldiers and he's found captain miller's grave and he walks alone this older james ryan down to the grave and he speaks to captain miller who's dead but he says my family is with me today they wanted to come with me to be honest with you i wasn't sure how i feel coming back here every day i think about what you said to me that day on the bridge i tried to live my life the best that i could i hope it was enough i hope that at least in your eyes i've earned what all of you have done for me of course there's no response and then he stands up this old man and", "he turns to his wife who walks over to him and he says tell me i've lived a good life tell me i'm a good man and she says you are and you just look into his eyes sense he doesn't know have i done anything i've just lived my life i've done anything great i have i earned it he doesn't have any confidence you can tell here's the thing you need to hear me say if you hear nothing else all the religions of the world say jesus christ says receive this received paid for it now just receive it you can't earn it you have been called to inherit a blessing and so the right hand goes to the one that would have never received the blessing of the firstborn but by faith you see you already have amen let's pray father how glad i am that you have right hand on us who are gentiles on us who are far from god on us who are god that your blessing of the firstborn rested on jacob is mind-blowing but you make jacobs into you make them into men and women that are god-governed you put your hand on ephraims who don't have a hope of any kind of a blessing like that but by grace through faith we have it so lord would you help us not just to be blessed but to share with our families how we have been who did it lord and lean right to the end in jesus amen let's all stand and sing together you took on the prayer so not even death can't chase you know we don't love to think about our deaths and i don't think we need to we should live in the moment until the lord calls us home and i i don't know that you can plan out much about your dying days because you don't have any promise from god to be able to live those out but you could jot down some of your thoughts that you'd want to make if god were to take you suddenly that other people would know about you you could write down the blessings even for your children and i think or your grandchildren i'd recommend that even if you don't use them right now that they would be something that someone would read about you you last will and testament we always think about someone's will but actually the idea is the last will and testimony that's what it originally was and if you read some of these from the early american history the last will and they said what i'm giving to you my", "children is my faith in jesus christ and my confidence in the word of god and his promises you need to own this faith yourself so i encourage you to think a little bit and obviously our death day is yet ahead uh but it is good to say lord i want so may the lord bless you so that you can bless others because when jacob said i want to bless you he starts out by talking about how god had blessed him you can't give what you don't have so you need to be in touch with the way god has blessed you and then make make god make you a worshiper you know the older i get in i don't sing any better but i long to more and more you know why because i've been created for eternity i've been made to be a worshiper so have you and that's why i love coming here worship is far more than singing some songs on sunday morning it's about the way we live and it's about seeing the goodness of god may god help give you eyes to see the shepherd that is the redeemer the god who's been gracious and merciful to all your life and then may he make us you know sometimes people say well you know that was close but he didn't get it you know and i was you know i was i almost made it they said well that only works in what is it horseshoes and hand grenades almost you know but a horseshoe can be a leaner and it with faith a horseshoe is a ringer i mean not a horseshoe a leaner is a a person who's leaning to the end that's what we want to be and we don't outgrow that by the way let me just say this i know it's time to go sometimes we think well for my children they need to see that i trust god even if i'm struggling i want them to realize i'm not afraid and i'm not worried and i'm because i don't want them to think my faith is you're not helping them by being phony you just be you just be honest and by definition means i need somebody i'm weak i have a thorn in the flesh i have an injury let god redeem that to teach your kids still are depending on a living god amen god will use that to bless them and you give them an example god bless you", "join in with us well tonight we're in exodus so if you'd open your bible exodus 23 as we continue our verse by through the old testament exodus 23 and since it's going to be a longer section i'm just going to read the first nine verses and we'll start with that and see how it goes exodus 23 you shall not bear a false report do not join your hand with a to be a malicious witness you shall not the masses in doing evil wow where was this first list last summer went away it was right here nor shall you testify in a dispute so as to turn aside after a multitude in order to pervert nor shall you be partial to a poor man in his dispute if you meet your enemy's ox or his donkey i'm trying to picture a beating it okay if you beat your enemies ox or his donkey wandering away you shall surely return it to him if you see the donkey of one who hates you lying helpless its load you shall refrain from leaving it to him you shall surely release it with him you shall not pervert the due to your needy brother in his dispute keep far from a false charge and do not kill the innocent or the righteous god says for i will not acquit the guilty you shall not take a bribe for a bribe the clear-sighted and subverts the cause of the just you shall not oppress a stranger since you yourselves know the feelings of a stranger for you were in the land of egypt lord as you're giving your people who have just become really just become a body that was identifiable as as a uh there in the wilderness and from mount sinai heaven giving them the ten commandments and now explaining to them things that will affect their lives so that they know what justice looks like i thank you lord that you teach us too you want us to not only know what's right and do what's right but you want us to reflect you who are always doing the right thing and so lord our world can't help us with this maybe even sometimes the way we grew up or the home we grew up in or our own feelings won't help us our own understanding but your word is eternal and perfect it's not just mostly right it's all right and so help us to see through your eyes the things that have to do with what matters to you thank you that your foundations are justice lord", "we want to be a just people and merciful and it's in jesus name we pray amen all right you can be seated well most of you know the song from micah 6 8 he has shown the o man what is good and what the lord requires of you but to do justice or justly love mercy and to walk humbly with your god and i love the fact that god takes and gives us very short lists uh my one of my sons was saying you know i was going over the ten commandments the other day and i can only come up with nine of them and of course then he did he remembered the song that he learned as a kid he got all 10 of them but it's like you know even a list of 10 sometimes we can't quite remember and but when the lord gives us a very short list it's a little easier and there in micah 6 8 god takes all of his commands and he just kind of that he wants us to do justice or do mercy and that means grace and uh to be kind and generous and forgiving and then just to walk humbly with the lord and i love that but in our text tonight we're gonna see how this is important to the lord and reiterate it again and again all through the old testament but put it down do justly do justly that's what the lord wants and i want you to jot down deuteronomy 16 and verse 19. you shall not distort justice you shall not be partial and you shall take a bribe for a bribe blinds the eyes of the wise and perverts the words of almost sounds like it's a repetition in deuteronomy of what we have read here but while this first verse of bearing a false report or joining with a wicked man and a certainly applies to being in a court lying about somebody claiming something is true that isn't so we would say you know giving perjury or committing it's not limited to just that it's any time that we're saying something that's not true or something that we don't know is true so put this down don't bear a false witness through because we actually can be never in a courtroom and yet really breaking this command a form of false witness listen to this abraham was pried open twice the first occasion was in 1887 22 long years after his assassination why you may ask it was not to determine if he had died from a bullet fired from john wilkes booth", "derringer it was because a rumor was sweeping the country that his coffin was actually empty a select group of witnesses observed that the rumor was totally false then they watched as the casket was resealed with lead but a second time 14 later the martyred man's withered body was viewed again this time by even more why again for the same grim purpose rumors of the same nature had again implanted doubts in the public's mind the pressure mounted to such proportions that the same ghoulish grotesque ceremony had to be carried out in spite of the strong of lincoln's son robert the body was exposed a second time officials felt the rumors should be laid to rest along with the civil war so finally the corps was permanently embedded in a crypt at springfield just rumors just sharing things that maybe you don't know to be true but somebody told you or you think might be true especially about other people it's very easy to fall into gossip i just read this this last week and i wanted to share it with you about school many of you have gone to college and you know in certain colleges uh you know you don't have to necessarily stay too long if the teacher doesn't show up depending on the rank of the professor it was one of those stories this person was writing about they were freshmen they said my first year in college was at a local and of course one of my first classes i was nervous my first day and the tension continued to build as we sat waiting for the professor to arrive it was deathly silent and i watched the clock in front of the room a little disappointed that the professor was already five minutes late then one brave student broke the silence commenting that because the teacher was only an associate professor we could leave after waiting for only 15 minutes this sounded good to me it seemed that this broke the tension and a conversation took off from there another student asked if anyone knew anything about the teacher and there were numerous answers he was a hard grader another commented that he strict one girl said that she heard he gave an overabundance of homework there were numerous comments after that and most were not very complementary there were a lot of jokes at the teachers expense finally the student who at the beginning seemed to know the rules stood up and said well it has been 15 minutes but i'm not going to leave in fact i think i'll stay and begin today's class", "it was the professor and what the professor got to hear is everybody's opinion about him to do anything about him and that the fact is when people are not around we are so apt to join in many times in being critical you know jesus said that we will give an account for every idle word every single word we ever true story years ago this happened in new york there was a magnetic storm and somehow i don't know exactly how this works but a telephone call that was a private phone call between two people was actually broadcast on a nationwide radio program they had no idea but unfortunately the things they were it was two people that were having an and they were literally everybody in the nation heard that call you can imagine and so the fact is god says everything is going to be heard again you know sound waves go out they actually never ever stop do you know that they actually just keep going and going and going forever it's kind of scary huh but so don't bear witness through gossip but then put this down don't just go with the flow look at verse 2 you shall not follow the masses in doing evil nor shall you testify in a dispute so as to turn aside from after a multitude in order to pervert justice so now we're talking about mob mentality uh maybe it's at work or school or at home you're with some friends and people start doing something or they start saying something that's so easy to want to fit in to become a part of the problem jot down romans 12 and do not be conformed to this world but be by the renewing of your mind so that you may prove what the will of god is that which is good acceptable and perfect it is very easy in fact it's very natural of course in school they call it peer pressure but it doesn't go away just because you graduate from junior high school or high school or a college it's just a part of life that desire to fit in but i kind of tell you and this is a phrase i would share with every child that i have you share with your grandchildren teach them this because if they're going to need it they're going to need to know more than the phrase they're going to need to live it if you have to do wrong to be in the in you're in the wrong crowd say that again if you have to do wrong to be accepted", "in the in crowd you're in the wrong crowd the problem is we as are just as susceptible as unbelievers are to this pressure if you think about it the animal that god associates us with in the bible is what while we're sheep and sheep are herd and isaiah it says all we like sheep have gone ahead no all we like sheep have gone where astray sheep tend to follow sheep do you know in turkey in 2005 a huge herd of sheep one of them up on a one sheep jumped off the cliff one it was followed by 449 more in other words 450 sheep followed and died the other 1150 followed the 450 but it was just like a big pillow by that time so those they all survived all 1500 sheep followed each other off the cliff and we sheep we go astray and we easily go astray when the people around us aren't doing that that's why it's so important that you think about who do you spend your time with now we want to minister to unbelievers and we want to minister carnal christians we should but remember jesus said he was as a physician with the sick when he was accused of being a wine bible and a glutton why are you hanging out with unrighteous people it wasn't so much a temptation for jesus to blow it it was because they needed him and if you're hanging out with people that are not walking with the lord or don't know the lord because you're a physician to minister to the sick fine just make they know why you're there see when i go to my doctor's i can pick out the doctor right away it's not like which one is he you know and by the way he protects himself from getting anything that us patients have in fact nowadays it's video camera so they can't get the physicians make sure that they protect themselves from becoming sick but that your ticket if you're there to minister to people that's really your motive and they know that and you know that but the bible says bad company corrupts so you want to ask yourself this the people that you're best friends with the people that you're close friends with the people that are your acquaintances do you want to become more like them because you go oh no well be careful he who walks with the wise will be wise and by the way can i always remind you what that means it's not like you're if you're around intelligent people your", "iq goes up oh no that's not what it means at all because the word wise in the bible is very clearly defined in proverbs chapter the fear of the lord is the beginning of so i'm talking about to walk with the wise means you are with people who fear you're with people who know the lord love the lord and you should be saying i want to be like that as you say well somebody's got to be more spiritual they can't both be be with people that you want to be like don't be around people you say i hope i don't become like them because you're putting yourself in that environment all the time and you might be wondering why do i blow it you know i went as a couple and i'd arrest people who had committed a burglary or a robbery or whatever it was they would always always always blame it on somebody else it's just human nature i mean it started right at the beginning you know remember god said adam how did you know you were ah he said did you eat of the tree that i forbid you ah he didn't want to admit it it's like i the woman the reason i know that i'm is the woman did that thing and of course the woman said ah the serpent right the serpent went uh my pet rock he didn't have anybody to blame but the fact is that is just natural to blame somebody else and when we i'd respect people they'd oh it was never them they never go i am the cause of all the problems in this town and all my friends are get it they get it from me not one because no one's that honest well put this down be merciful a just way in a just way look at verse 3 nor shall you be partial to a poor man in his dispute and that's interesting the tendency read the book of james is that we're partial to people that can do something you know we're partial to people that are good looking or famous or rich or they have skills that we want it's like oh and james you know to the rich man come sit up here in the front you know can i can i rub your back you know anything you can do for you know i can do for you but the poor man you just kind of like god alvarez just sit wherever you want outside i don't care uh that's the problem of partiality in the book of james but here", "another form of partiality is actually to the poor man they say what's that about that's not necessarily the most but partiality can go either way jot down luke 20 and verse 21 they questioned jesus saying teacher we know that you speak and teach correctly and you are not partial to anyone but you teach the way of god in truth this is a big debate right now you know i mean i'm not saying it's exactly this issue but for some it is there's a move to vaccinate every illegal alien that comes into the country before americans are vaccinated it's a big deal right now now i understand that there there may be a need to do that to protect americans there's a big debate about this as though we need to do something more for those that are in need than we do even for the citizens fascinating now in verse 4 look at what it says he if you meet your enemy's ox or his donkey wandering away you shall surely return it to him if you see the donkey of one who hates lying helpless under its load you shall you shall refrain from leaving it to the or to your your enemy you shall surely from the load so here's the truth god is i want you to be merciful to your enemies obviously those animals are owned by somebody and god's saying be kind to the animal but he's saying more than that you need to be kind when you have the to people who don't like you now the fact is we don't like to do that there's something inside of us that says they're getting their fair you know it's too bad that you know they deserve that maybe god's punishing them you know there's a revenge bone in every one of our bodies i i as a kid i remember one of the jobs i was given that i hated wasn't a big job i just hated it but it was cleaning out the broom closet that doesn't sound like a very big job how big could a broom closet be well it wasn't so much that was big it's just it was a mess you know in the back of the day it wasn't plastic or paper you didn't bring you in your own bag they just all gave you bags and we would bring those home but we'd save every one of them because those bags were the size that we used for trash and so we had hundreds of different kinds of bags for lunch bags you know all free from alpha beta they", "were just given to us and yet the people just after we go to the store they just throw the bags into whatever shape they were in this closet so there were just mounds so the job of cleaning out the closet was to take every bag out re-crease the ball refold them all put them away knee of course put the broom away and everything else that was in there the people just kind of threw in there as they walked by but i never liked doing it i was a lazy little guy but i do remember at the end when i made it all look perfect the last thing that i did is i would prop the broom or the mop handle in there in such a way that the first person that opened the door it would hit i did it but somebody's gonna realize you don't want me to do it next time you know there's just something about that but here god is saying i want you to be merciful to your enemies why well he is see the whole idea of being totally devoted to the lord isn't just to be sold out but it's to become like be holy and the word holy means what it means to be different it means to be set apart for the lord be holy as i am holy be perfect as your heavenly father is it doesn't mean you're going to be sinless but your character were to reflect him you see we're his children like father like child jot down romans 5 and verse 8. god says this he demonstrates his own love toward us and that while we were sinners christ died for us in other words when you were in your sin not seeking god and your sin was commanding to destroy you you were his enemy that's when jesus said i'm going to die for him talk about taking the burden off he carried our burdens isaiah 53. shut down matthew 5 verses 44 and 45. but i say do you love your what love your enemies now let's just stop to leave it on the board so when i read a verse like this i don't know how you do it but it's like does does somebody come up in your rolodex let me go i have no enemies i have no enemies i don't even know anything that i have known you maybe good praise god that not a is hating you and not a person that you just don't prefer you know it could be somebody at work it could be somebody in your family i hope", "but if it does this command stands jesus your enemies didn't say ignore your enemies that's hard to know i just write them off nope love your enemies even pray for those who persecute you so that you may be what just like your heavenly father like father like son like father like the sons of your father who's in heaven for he causes his son to rise on the evil and the good and he sends rain on the righteous and the unrighteous so jesus loves his enemies why he loved us but on the cross he says of those that are killing him what father yeah see maybe we would pray father get sick them jesus said father forgive them they don't know what they're doing in verse 6 you shall not pervert the justice do your needy brother in his dispute jot down james 5 verses 4 through 6 he talks about it behold the pay of the laborers who mowed your fields or maybe your and the pay that was withheld by you cries out against you and the outcry of those who did the harvesting has reached the ears of the lord of sabiath you know what that means armies you have lived luxuriously on the and led a life of want and pleasure but all you've done is fattened your own hearts in a day of slaughter you have condemned and put to death the righteous man he does not resist you so this idea of perverting justice not doing what is fair for somebody that you should look at verse 7 keep far from a false charge and do not the innocent or the righteous for i will the guilty falsely falsely being accused in the old testament ahaz did this with naboth had a beautiful vineyard the king wanted it and uh he asked he said hey i'll give you money i'll trade you i'll give you vineyards and they will say no not interested and uh ahaz being the mature king that he was started pouting on his bed and was all depressed until somebody a little more wicked than him his wife in jezebel and said what's wrong with you you know i can't feel from day one he won't give it to me dude you're the king here let's sign some papers we'll get some false witnesses we'll pay them we'll have this thing and she did she had him killed based on false charges that were trumped up she has naboth killed so that the king can that that's exactly what we're talking about this idea of of bringing charges against", "so that you can gain in some way or to see them be punished you know it is it's very hard to have someone tell a lie about you especially when other people believe it any of you ever had that happen at work maybe or in the family it's really really hard and people tend to believe things quickly negative things even though it's not proven there's no jury when i was a little boy youngest of five um i remember there was a dispute in my family over peanut butter topping for ice cream somebody had gone into the pantry and eaten it all and they they threw it away and i mom and dad were asking hey where's the peanut butter topping you know and i said i don't know i didn't touch it you know and um i hadn't i really hadn't looked and so but it was what was the problem is there's only seven of us living there my mom and dad knew they didn't do it so they asked the five kids and down the line every single one i said i didn't do it i didn't do it i didn't do it it's like okay now we got a bigger problem than missing peanut butter topping we've got a liar and a thief so i'll never forget my dad us very seriously into his bedroom sat us down looked at us and said now listen i need you to tell me the truth you know it's hard not to start laughing it was anyway but he was like serious and i said i didn't why are you laughing i don't know it's funny anyway we but nobody would confess but in that context it was true i remembered being in the store with my sister my middle sister carol earlier that week we were walking in the alphabet right by this aisle where they sold that stuff and she goes oh this stuff is great and she picked it up and i said oh okay and she put it back down so i thought well i should at least you know if there's a big investigation this might be a tip so i shared that like i don't know that it means anything but hey that's all i know is my middle sister loves that stuff so she was convicted the entire family was sure she had done it and she just would refuse she never she never ever let she grew up refused to admit the truth then my older sister years later said it just refused to tell the truth too remember in jesus's trial they got two", "witnesses that would agree that jesus he'll destroy the temple and he'll raise it back up this whole idea of of saying something that you don't know to be true or worse knowing that it's not true and of course when it happens to you because it might not just be a rumor it might be a lawsuit because in lawsuits they like to juice the allegations you see uh and make them much bigger than even they could have been just so that more pain and suffering is going to be paid for by it look at you shall not take a bribe for a bribe blinds the clear-sighted and subverts the cause of the just you the literally major major problems in a number of nations all over the world still and maybe even we could say here but probably not as much here even if it regarding judges and and politicians and police officers certainly in russia certainly much of latin america in many many countries it's just the way when i was down in mexico city years ago on my way to cuba we stopped in mexico city to pick up a pastor's library for the first time i went to cuba in 1990 and i was with a christian guy that lives down there and was helping pastors make their trip in to visit their sister churches behind the communist wall we it was a big deal when we were going in back then because it wasn't even legal to bring in these resources but i remember we were driving around mexico city downtown this huge city and uh he got pulled over i don't even think i don't even think he had done anything wrong but he got and i said what'd you do he goes don't worry about it he got out of the car i watched him go back he handed the police officer or something and he got back in the car what was that about now i remember i was a cop at the time so he he had to give him some money that was the only way that that was going to get cleared now i'm not saying he should i'm just saying that it was either that or we're all going down to the station and he's going to lose his car it's very common and yet it's tragic you know this idea of bribery it's not only in the scriptures you find it in the gospels remember that the soldiers who saw the angel at were given money to come up with a story all the disciples came tonight and stole the body and they", "gave them money so that they would tell that story and that story was still being told at the time the gospels were written then look at verse 9 you shall not oppress a stranger since you yourselves know the feelings of a stranger for you also were strangers in the land you know all through the scriptures we have this command we talked about this before how the lord's gonna when he judges the sheep goats there the nations one of the issues is gonna be i was a and you invited me in to the sheep to uh to the goats i was a stranger and you didn't invite me in just as simple as that the way we treat somebody who's a foreigner or maybe just a foreigner from our church they're new um jot down hebrews 13 and verse 2 hebrews 13 do not neglect to show to strangers for by this some have entertained angels without knowing it now this is a reference we'll study it on sunday morning when we get there of course to the old testament to the story of both abraham and lot where we see angels coming in to sodom and being forced to sit out in the open square and lot taking them in remember that story but he didn't know that they were angels and i know we get excited about this idea that can you imagine if somebody we don't know or some stranger is really an angel you that's kind of interesting if you want to read a good book read the book by billy graham called angels he talks about these kinds of appearances of of angels in the form of just strangers or sometimes homeless people whatever that have disappeared on people and and that's fascinating because we sometimes when they when we started the wall maybe that person i don't know there's an angel you know and wouldn't that be cool i remember uh some of uh some certain restaurants maybe you've worked for one have programs to test the quality of the service of the people that work like starbucks has this and there are many restaurants that and they have people that are hired just to come in and pretend that they're buying something like a regular customer it's usually called a secret shopper and uh so you come in and there's certain things that they've trained their people to say and to do you know some to give the best but this person is going in to see if you do and say the things you're supposed to do because you're being evaluated not so much even the food necessarily", "maybe that too but really the service and if you don't do it right or you don't do it well they'll give you what's called an oops card in your file and they you know use it for training but somebody said that's kind of what the lord does he has angels in this world that we don't even necessarily we're dealing with them and yet there is this opportunity and so when jesus said i was a stranger and you'd invited me and he's not saying he was that stranger but what he's saying is your treatment of a stranger i'm taking it personal and really regardless if they have angel wings sweater the idea is that every stranger is an opportunity for you to minister to the lord every one of them and that's pretty convicting as well but he's saying this look in egypt you didn't belong that way we didn't speak egyptian you weren't you were an outsider and you were living there your whole life some of you moved at a certain point and you were the you were alone in your school like everybody else played with each other it's very hard to be on the outside and if you're new that's the way it is i remember i worked at a job at a factory shoescape factory of all things and i was the only person working in the factory that spoke english and at lunch nobody talked to me because i don't think they i could talk to me and i couldn't talk to them you know i could say you know que paso you know i you know three or four words but there wasn't enough to have a conversation but they were all just enjoying each other and i just felt very alone and it could be there's someone here tonight and you feel like i'm just visiting and i don't know anybody here and no one said hi to me i hope someone said hi to you but the lord wants us to be like remember barnabas what does barnabas name mean anybody know raise your hand so i know who's saying something who what son of encouragement that's right bar son of nabas encouragement and that wasn't his real name but that was his nickname at the why because he always was encouraging people by the way it is barnabas who takes saul after he the apostles are terrified of saul why because he's out to kill us he's probably pretending to be a christian to get in here nobody wanted to have anything to do with paul now supposedly a christian but barnabas took", "introduced him to the apostles and he brought him in they unfolded him be that kind of a person have eyes to see behind your friends beyond the people that you know especially if you think i know that person's probably new and go introduce yourself and invite them uh to meet some other people we'll put this down in verses 10 through 13 now we move on and write it in the word rest we need to learn to give it a rest in verse 10 you shall sow your land for six years in its yield but on the seventh year you let it rest and life fallow so that the needy of your people may eat and whatever they leave the beast of the field may eat you are to do the same with your vineyard and your olive grove verse 12. six days you are to do your work but on the seventh day you shall cease from labor so that your ox and your may rest and the son of your female slave as well as your stranger may refresh themselves now concerning everything which i have said to you be on your guard do not mention the name of other gods nor let them be heard from your mouth now god uniquely in the ancient world you won't find any other ancient civilization that had a six day work week that was crazy they were also they were but god uniquely created and of course after his own creative order of resting on the seventh day told his people they were to do the same to work six days and then to rest it's interesting when you think about it coming to the lord begins with a rest right come unto me all who are wearing heavy laden it starts there um someone said it's interesting that beethoven's fifth symphony which is his famous uh you know that one it's the only thing like it in music that has a rest in the first line it's not done no there's a rest in between the third done and the fourth and that done that rest carries throughout the entire symphony it's very and they made the analogy that that's true of the christian's life as well when you come to christ you are called to rest from your own labors and achieving some kind of performance acceptance with god and entering into his rest his finished work and then that is not just how it that becomes the way it is throughout the rest of your life christian maturity if you study hebrews you find out that christian maturity has to do with living", "in the rest that god provides that's why the children of israel could not go into the promised land they didn't believe god about the giants so they spent the rest of their lives going in circles in the wilderness and they were never able to enter into the rest of god that's immaturity never enjoys the rest little faith never experiences the rest of god always worried always fearful always striving but maturity is coming to that place where you're able to rest not only that but that this problem that we're facing right now god's going to handle that too god's in charge of my life well put this down when we rest others get blessed uh we think of god commanding us to rest in the scriptures as a way to recharge physically instead of working every day uh overdoing it being a workaholic uh maybe recharging ourselves emotionally certainly spiritually it's kind of like that's true but resting in the scriptures has to do with faith expressing our trust in god why well because everybody else is working seven days and i'm only working six and there's more money that could be made right there in front of me yeah i'm not working though i'm trusting that i'm going to have enough you see that expresses faith in god and his provision and by the way every seventh year remember these were all farmers for the most part every seventh year you were not allowed to work the fields for a whole year it wasn't just the it was a whole year leaving your fields and god says i want you to do that i'll provide for you you'll discover it if you'll trust me but it's not just providing for you it will also provide for the poor and the animals why because the law said you let your fields grow you don't go and harvest them and plant harvest but there will be things that will grow naturally on that seventh year but you them that's for the poor to come in and enjoy and that's for my animals to come in and enjoy it and that interesting god says i care about everyone i even about my you know my wife becky loves loves loves birds and we we have a small backyard but the birds know company house this morning the breakfast club you know and uh she she makes sure now squirrels steal half of it but does she make sure that that bird feeder is always full and she delights to feed the world and i'll tell her i said you know i've read the bible the bible says god", "feeds the birds she says i know he uses you know jot down proverbs 12 and verse 10 listen to what the bible says a or woman has regard for the life of but even the compassion of the wicked is cruel in other words your faith is actually reflected in the way you treat fido that's what the scripture teaches how do you treat your beast how you animal and i know a lot of us love our animals but god says yeah that's one way that you express faith in me is that you about your beast and by the way in the children of israel didn't really do very good they were really committed to observations as far as the seventh day don't get me wrong they were extremely so they've added all kinds of new rules to that one but with this idea of the seventh year oh no they did not obey that one so actually do you know that the children of israel went into captivity to babylon anybody know for how long 70 years and jeremiah prophesied you're going to go into captivity you're leaving the land for 70 years and you know why you're going for 70 years because you failed to obey god's command to leave the fields for that seventh year for 490. so it's going to get its rest god is going to make sure that the ground gets us to rest jot down second chronicles 36 verses 20 and 21 those who had escaped from the sword he carried away to babylon and they were servants to him and to his sons until of the kingdom of persia to fulfill the word of the lord by the mouth of until the land had enjoyed its sabbaths all the days of its desolation it kept sabbath until 70 years were complete god says listen let me put it this way if you refuse to honor god's principles of rest he he may he may help you i mean that the lord sometimes will take this out i don't mean take this home necessarily you know i mean you thought you were going to be in school this semester or you thought you were going to do this job the lord might say you know what we need to talk and so we're going to spend some time together and you're not going to be going anywhere you know you're gonna get covered you're gonna be home or you're gonna you're not gonna have covered but you're not gonna be willing to go i wanna spend some time alone with you and i believe god does that at times not", "necessarily because we're disobedient just because he loves us but look at verse 13 now concerning everything which i have said to you be on your guard and do not mention the other gods nor let them be heard from your mouth you know i've noticed something about microsoft word if you write a word that the dictionary the built-in dictionary doesn't know you get a red line under it right you're familiar with that and if you right-click on your mouse it'll say add this to your dictionary so you you know you can make up your own words and your own vocab but it will add i don't know how to get rid of words that are put into that dictionary or that i accidentally put in the dictionary i don't know if there's even a way to do that and i was thinking about that because it's it's actually telling us there's that shouldn't be in our vocabulary when we come to the lord he's like i don't want you to be mentioning other gods anymore you know it'd be like uh you were in love with somebody and uh you thought you were gonna marry them and then it didn't work out they married somebody else you were still loved you had your heart broken you got over it you married somebody and every once in a while you're talking about the other person that's probably like a no-no god's saying i don't want you talking about other gods the gods back in egypt no no no i'm jealous over you i don't want to share you or have a relationship and i don't want you to be thinking about those other gods can i tell you one of those words that i think sometimes god would say take that out of your vocabulary delete it it's the word luck it's the word luck you say why well do that luck is actually from greek mythology and the goddess named has nothing to do with tuna for tuna is a goddess of greek mythology when you fortune you may not know it i'm not talking about making a fortune i'm having good fortune or luck or chance you're actually using the name of a foreign god or for that matter speaking about fate i think sometimes we as christians don't realize it you should speak about fate do you know the fates are actually goddesses within uh greek mythology who are responsible three sisters who the yarn of life and each one of them spins out the the thread latches measures it out and then anthropos cuts it off at the end when you die", "and these three fates are the ones who are in charge of your life baby and god saying don't talk about faith that's not in charge of your life but we ask or you know we do we just say things because we've heard them before you know oh i hope we can do such as this knock on wood what i don't know it's my mom and dad knock do you know that that's a germanic pagan practice believing that the spirits live in the trees and you're you're not wanting to offend them and you're you say well i don't mean that bite i get it but i have a feeling god would say kind of don't use words about other gods because it doesn't really bless me well put this down don't forget to you say remember what well let's read verse 14 three times a year you shall celebrate a feast to me you shall observe the feast of unleavened bread for seven days you're to eat unleavened bread as i commanded you at the appointed time in the month of habib for in it you came out of egypt and none shall appear before me empty-handed put this down he that is the lord satisfies the saved he is the bread of life and that of course is from john 6 35. now each of the feasts in some way portrays the ministry of jesus by the way this first feast that the males were required to go to jerusalem ultimately when they're there to present themselves before the lord is attached to the feast of unleavened bread in other words passover was celebrating the day nissan 14 when the children of israel came out when the blood was put on the door but then for seven days after passover they were to have no leaven and no leavened bread as they began their on this walk with the lord and of course jesus identified himself as the if you will the passover bread that if we eat it we would live forever uh leaven allowed in the life of a believer it's a picture of evil it's a picture of polluting influence and so they get rid the leaven i'll put this down he is our he is the first fruit so the next uh celebration is in verse 16. also you shall observe the feast of the harvest of the firstfruits of your from what you sow in the field now that is the feast we know as pentecost okay we always think of pentecost as the day of the holy spirit and that's true the spirit of god came", "on the day of pentecost put in the word and first if you didn't hear me say it the first time but the celebration of the harvest the feast is actually celebrating the planting the second pentecost is the celebration of the first harvest there are two harvests in their agricultural year this one of course happens in the spring and it's a type and a picture of who jesus is why jot down first corinthians 20. but now christ has been raised from the dead the what first fruits of those who are asleep and also first corinthians 15 23 but each of us will be raised paul says in our own order christ the firstfruits and after that those who are christ's at his coming so the this harvest is a picture of the and certainly it's true jesus is the first one who resurrected from the dead who is never to die again you know it's interesting when you think about harvest being a picture of of the coming of the lord in the rapture because in a harvest you take things that have been buried in the ground out and that's exactly what the lord says the dead in christ will rise and we'll get to go up along with a great picture of the rapture then number the third festival he is our reward he is all that we need and this last uh feast that they were to celebrate is what we call the feast of tabernacles sukkot or the feast of booths and this is a uh at the timing of the final harvest in israel and it's a picture of the lord's return when he comes and dwells among his people remember the feast of booths or the tab feast of tabernacles was a time that the nation of israel even when they're in the are to go out and for a week they stay in kind of like lean to's or little tents where they're pretending if you will or remembering the way it was during the wilderness wanderings when god dwelt among them the pillar of cloud the pillar of fire and then in the tent of meeting so god was dwelling in a tent the while they were dwelling and walking through if you will the desert with them so the idea was i want you to remember the way it was for your forefathers remember that they were totally completely dependent on me for everything but i provided for them psalm 23 we all know it says the lord is my shepherd i shall not what meaning i don't need anything i'm good", "becky will say to me i'm going to the store do you need anything it's like ah nope in fact just don't go stay well fact is god is saying my children i want them to realize eating all their needs and i want you to think back on my provision in your life i like what corey ten boom said she once you'll never know all you have in jesus until jesus is all you have and maybe you've had a loss maybe you've had a great loss and maybe it's like be the same maybe things won't always be the same as they were but the lord wants to fill that void and he's the only one who can david said if mother and father forsake me the lord will take me up and it's our opportunity to discover all we have in the lord when we lose things i think well the thing about these feasts that i just want to point out is the first verse of in verse uh look at back in verse 14 three times a year you shall celebrate a feast to me and verse 17 it's from the bookend three times a year all your mails shall the lord god what i want you to see here is that these feasts that god instituted were more than just religious they really speak of personal relational celebrations god says i want you to do this and i want you to be with me i want you to be right in other words you're going through you're remembering what i've done for you in but i want you to personalize it that should be true when you're baptized that should be true every time you take the lord's supper we shouldn't just go the lord's supper you know jesus gave to the disciples he washed their feet and just talked about what he did he's wanting to minister to us right now when you get baptized yes it's a picture of christ's death and resurrection absolutely you should understand that but now it's your turn you're dying and you're coming back to life this is about you and the lord and the lord told his people i want you to remember what i've done don't forget to remember what i've done but remember i want to do it in your right now put this down letter d be uncompromising look at verse 18 and 19. i hope we get time to finish this but you shall not offer the blood of my sacrifice with leavened bread nor is the fat of my feast to remain overnight until morning you shall bring", "first fruits of your soil into the house of the lord your god and then the final verse you are not to young goat where it says that literally it means a young goat in the milk of its fascinating verse that has been will maybe continue to be till we get to heaven put this down don't pollute the sacrifice this is the first thing we see in verse 18 you shall not offer the blood of my sacrifice with leavened bread in other words i don't want you to mix things that which i have ordained and that which i have not ordained and in this case leaven bread again it's a type and a picture of that which is polluted or corrupted look if we add works to grace well grace is no longer grace if you add something to the finished work of christ it's no longer powerful in your life you can't do that you can't add something to what the lord has said is already perfect if you add to it you destroy it put this down don't leftovers it's interesting he's talking about passover and he basically you don't turn passover into leftovers in exodus 12 10 the same is said when they ate the passover meal remember they did that as a family but they had to eat the whole thing you couldn't say you know i'm kind of my tummy's full let's just put it in that tupperware and there's a spiritual reason for that in fact god said if you do leave it over the next day you just gotta burn it you're not gonna eat it his intention was everything that was sacrificed for you and provided for you needs to be consumed and internalized by you it's very interesting concept you can't really accept less than all of his provision you can't receive half of christ for years i've heard people say well when i received christ i think i received him as savior but not as lord i don't remember that verse that says you can do that well i mean i wanted to be saved but i didn't let him control my life so i accepted kind of oh i'll i'll take the salvation but hold if christ isn't lord of all the old saying is he's not lord at all lordship of jesus christ is not the goal of salvation it is the starting block jesus said if anyone wishes to come that's where you begin deny yourself take up your cross and follow you have to die to yourself it's beg it's not that you're going to do it", "perfectly by any means but you're saying from day one lord you're now in charge of my life whoever will confess him as lord shall be saved it means i want him to be i don't know how to let him be lord i keep fighting him all the time you know we have that expression in the scriptures you know we're not to use the name of the lord in vain we usually mean i swear you know blind ah you broke the commandment well maybe but actually if you think about it we quite often the word lord in vain because what does the word lord well it means master and by the way we're not alone in this it means i've decided you're in charge of my life you have total authority you're always right and my only responsibility is to obey it's the only responsibility of a soldier is to show up for duty not to the commanding officer about what he ought to be doing what you think you ought to be doing with your day you're only oh you just got to show up do what he says so when we call jesus lord we're saying i've already decided you're right i'm going to do it just show me now i like to say disciples don't make decisions they make if he's my lord i need to discover what he wants me to do i don't have to make a decision that's already been made right but the problem is like peter when jesus said i've got to go to the cross and oh and he rebukes jesus nah that's not a that's never going to happen no no no really peter well then get behind me satan it's simon but close no satan's using your mouth in your heart for me you love me but you understand you're exactly opposite of what god wants to do you're setting your mind on the things of man or how about you think after the holy spirit filled that never happened well read what happens when he's there and he has the experience with the sheet that comes down remember that down in joppa and the lord says arise kill and eat all these you know i'm i'm sure there was bacon in it because there was creepy things there that you and i wouldn't eat and the lord says arya's killing me it's like oh no lord i've never done that i'm a good jewish boy i think this is a test and he's saying lord but he's not doing what god says and there are many times you feel like", "no i won't i can't that's not can't be we use the name of the lord in vain much more than we think i think well this last verse i want to take a moment uh or real quick in verse 19 he says you shall bring the choice first fruits of your soil into the house of the lord your god now the very first part of the crop they were to go out and tie a little thread around that crop that was coming up and they were to make a declaration here it low these are first fruits the idea of the first fruits are these are the beginning of the harvest and before i see the rest of it come up i'm already giving this to god this is the lord's i'm declaring it in faith i believe more is coming you see that's why jesus is the first fruits of all those who are dead he is the first one but there is more coming you and me you see in the resurrection but it's interesting because then it's tied to this strange statement you are not to king james in new american standard boil a kid or a in the milk of its mother now i cannot tell you for sure what that there are a lot of ideas most of which i think are probably not right um you know sometimes people hear things and they come up with interpretations of things and that they're doing the best they can but they got it wrong jesus was accused of saying that he was going to destroy the temple he never he never said he was going to destroy the temple he was talking about his body not the physical that was misunderstood they misunderstood jesus prophecy concerning john that they thought he's going to stay alive until jesus returns everybody will say that that's not what he said he didn't say it but even it's just it's just the nature of man i know i know kids that thought when they were kids and they heard songs on the radio they thought they knew the meaning the words and now they laugh right you know one of my daughters-in-law admitted that uh the song hold me closer tiny dancer she thought it was holding me closer it's the way she liked tony downs i guess had a crush i know another kid it was a girl i don't know it's always girls but anyway she uh had this thing about uh you know that song get your motor running head out on the highway and there's a line that says i gotta go", "and make it happen right and she thought it was garden grove makes it happen because she lived in garden grove so that's the you know so it's just the nature of people to misinterpret things uh it's always been that way it'll always be that way and here god put in his word you're not to boil a kid in its mother's milk so mammadies one of the most famous scholars really in the middle ages said that this was a pagan practice uh to to use the milk and boil kid and then to use it for fertility rights among the pagans and what god is saying is don't act like don't do what the pagans do uh and this happens a lot where people misinterpret things with scripture people there are people who say it's a sin to get a tattoo and i can show you in the book where it says you're not to get a tattoo well that has not to do with modern day tattoos there's other reasons not to get that are just about wisdom but in my opinion because you could be there the rest of your life hope you love it but but in terms of violating scripture that was an occultic practice when they did it had nothing to do with body art and people try to or you know you can't get a chip because then you're going to be you know worshipping satan no the technology is not the problem it's going to be used by the antichrist but people are they just misinterpret scripture well this is one of those verses because for the jews to this day what it means is you can't mix milk and meat products and they're very common when we go to israel when they you can't they will you cannot have a cheeseburger they can't do that or chicken parmesan can't do that you can't have uh meat and uh milk products and and they've brought in it out from goat meat i mean if it was just goat meat that's what the verse says but they broader than that in fact you can have fish that's allowed um with dairy products but you can't even have turkey with milk even though no one has ever a turkey get milked ever you know so it's a little odd um so some say it says pagan practice and you shouldn't do what the pagans do uh other people say it has to do with it's not very nice to the to the you know poor little goat that you're you know boiling in its mother's", "milk and how on insensitive i'm not sure the little goat who's dead is too upset about that but anyway some say it's you can't mix life and death and there's a whole dennis prager has a whole idea about that but here's an interesting thing that i'll just leave with you as a possibility it is interesting to me that the word boil in our text in hebrew does not only mean to boil something such as milk or water in fact it's used in the bible in translated other words it is a word that can mean to boil for sure but it has to do with preparing something until it's done so if you boil something you're it's used for instance in genesis of fruit that is ripened on the vine it is fulfilled and come to maturity and so in the 12th century this rabbi commenting on this said here is what this passage is actually saying it's saying the same thing that the verse right before it says you shall not bring the ch you shall bring the choice first fruits of your soil into the house of the lord your god in other words the first fruits belong to the lord and then what he says anyway is this it's not about boiling a goat it's about you shall not take a goat and have it come to maturity never weaning it from its mother before sacrifice it in other words when that goat is born and it's supposed to be sacrificed to the lord you don't procrastinate and delay it by letting it grow up that's the idea is that when you make a commitment to the lord you fulfill it those first fruits you give those to the lord because they're his and he's using a poetic expression and by the way he does it again later in exodus if you want to jot down exodus 34 26 says you shall bring the very first fruits of your soil into the house of your god and again you won't boil or grow up a goat with its mother's milk in other words don't let it when it's time when it's right at the beginning is when you should dedicate it not after it's grown to maturity not finished growing up so maybe that's the idea i don't know we'll get there we can moses what was you talking about when we though we want to close in song but i want to pray for us father as we look at your laws we that some of these things are strange to our ears and yet the principles", "are just as relevant right now lord to gossip to not bear false witness to not use bribery or a means to get people to do what we want or accept that or to be partial lord these are all things that we have to as well lord we want to be a people that you lord we have people that probably or will at some point or maybe even if we're honest people that we're struggling loving or that we have to say we're we're hating too or we want revenge lord forgive us for that teach us to that hate us because you loved us when our sin made us your enemy we want to be children of the most high god we want your character we know it won't come naturally but by your spirit's filling it can come so make it the fruit that comes from our life and the armor that protects our life the character of christ in us for your glory in jesus name amen let's all stand and sing together my prayer would be that the things that we're learning about wouldn't just be book knowledge that they would be changing so maybe one of your first applications will be someone is going to want to share something with you that really you shouldn't be hearing and you're going to remember back we're talking about gossip tonight you're going to go i i don't you know see it's one thing to say i won't share it it's another thing to say hey let's just pray for him and that'll shut a gossip down pretty quick it's like let's tell the lord about that and ask him you know you can do that without judging him it's like thou gossipper thou art going to hell and i'm going to watch you know you don't have to be mean to say hey let's turn this around redeem it as an opportunity to to minister to them and it's true some of us have people in our lives and they love to share the latest you know some people have as a motto if you don't have good to say let's hear it and just don't be that kind of a person but may god bless you as you take these truths and say lord how do i how do i deal with them what should i do with this i don't go around judging all the gossips in my life i just don't want them pointing to me as one of those lord make my mouth full of your praise not your criticism of other people jesus said the kindest thing to people who", "if you think about it he could have been very critical about look at the way he talks to people in the scriptures in luke 4 it says the people wondered at the gracious words that fell from his lips may people wonder at the gracious words that fall from your lips this week god bless you", "i a man of God am i a woman of God the word man by the way is not male it just means a person anthroposophy human are you a person who people associate you with God the people that know the Lord of the people that don't at work do they associate you with Christ do they go then are some of you maybe I call you religious maybe I call you a bible thumper maybe it's not a very polite term a Jesus Freak would to God that more Christians would be called that because they're so sold out for Jesus Christ and you might say well Bob that's great for you in the ministry but I believe it shouldn't have anything to do with being in vocational ministry that people recognize that you're a man or woman who's after the Lord when I was a police officer in La Habra I wasn't a pastor but they nicknamed me father Bob and I didn't ask for that they just I don't know why they just decided that's who I was father Bob and so that was my nickname and I don't think you have to have a nickname but people should know that what is really important to you is your relationship with the Lord and how you represent him and Paul calls Timothy a man of God now this is a a person a man of God is a person who knows that they have a singular purpose in life you might say it's God's man on God's mission to share God's message and by the way there's only a handful of people in the whole Bible that are called a man of God Moses is one of them he is called the man of God repeatedly so was Elijah and Elijah so was David and so was Samuel and the contrast couldn't be any more obvious from the false teachers the false teachers they're an emphasis that Paul has been referring to you might say we're were monies men but Timothy is God's man they were men of the world though they pretended to be men of God they were really not they were men of this world whereas Timothy is a man of the word they were men of the flesh whereas Timothy is a man of faith and so I want to talk to you about becoming holy here's what does it mean if I am fully here's what would that look like maybe you don't know it of yourself you say I don't really know how to measure well these scriptures will help us put this down No", "what to flee from and what to follow after to be a man of God to be a woman of God what to flee from and what to follow after he says but flee from these things now in context he's talking about the love of money in this particular place but it means that a person who sold out to the Lord is going to have an aversion to certain things in their life and in this world listen to this a father was reading Bible stories to his young son and he read this the man named lot and there in the Old Testament was warned to take his wife and flee out of the city but his wife looked back and was turned to salt the son asked what happened to the flee let me read that again a father was reading the Bible the man named lot was warned to take his wife and flee out of the city what happened to the flee may I suggest to you that's a great question to ask in each of our lives put this down number 1 run from sin and temptation like that prophet once said Kenny Rogers you need to know when it's time to walk away and when it's time to run and the scriptures when it comes to a number of things we're commanded to flee there are a number of flees in the Bible this is just one of them flee from the love of money from greed from materialism but we're told in first Corinthians to flee immorality the word is poor nayad we could safely pornography run away from it or anything to do with sexual sin 2nd Timothy 2:22 flee youthful lusts first corinthians again he says flee idolatry and a lot of us think well I don't have a trouble with that well that's that's that's it babe just told me this last Friday night he said I was a golf pro and it became my idol anybody who's is that in the golf usually it has to become their idol to be successful before I came to Christ what's more important to you than God anything that's more important to you that God is your idol whether it might just be you but the Bible says we're to flee all of those things flee from put into the word temptation if you haven't already there is this within a person who's gonna be sold out to the Lord you're gonna have to hate sin and move away from it the things that your flesh loves your soul has to choose to hate if you're gonna be", "closer to God and the fact is if we're honest I think most of us would admit we are more ready to ask God for forgiveness than we are to ask him for deliverance from our sin and our temptation remember the prayer Jesus taught us to pray lead us not into temptation now the problem is not that God's gonna lead you into temptation the problem is you're gonna want to follow it but the Bible says make no provision for the flesh with regards to its lusts but it's easy to compromise right here at this point God forgive me God for me that's great after the fact but too often that becomes the way we deal with sin we don't deal with it beforehand true story I heard of a deacon that at the end of every prayer meeting on Wednesday nights at the church would stand up but he would pray the same prayer you know there are some people that pray the same prayers they just kind of get used to it and he would stand up and he'd say this prayer at the end of the prayer in front of everybody lord please clean the cobwebs out of my life I was his weekly prayer Lord please clean the cobwebs out of my life amen after several weeks of saying that he said it again Lord please clean the cobwebs out of my life and before he could say Amen Oh a woman stood up and said Lord don't do it kill the spider you know I think we have to have we got to realize Lord am I just saying now forgive me I thank you Jesus you died for me but what about my propensity and my commitment really just to to move away from Sid before I commit it how easy it is to not run when I should and of course the great example of running from sexual sin as Joseph jotted down Genesis 39 12 you remember this story how Potiphar's wife you know I don't know how you picture don't picture her as a you know 90 year old lady in a shriveled-up who's somehow interested in Joseph she was probably a very attractive woman who's out to lay with Joseph even though she's married and Joseph as a slave in platter for his house and Bible says she's coming on to Joseph every day telling him to lie with her and he you know has been abandoned by his family he's been he's an innocent man who's been done wrong and he's living as a slave in Egypt how easy it", "would have been to say hey God's forgotten about me I'm gonna seek pleasure where I can but he refuses and it says that Potiphar his wife caught him by his garment and she said live with me and he left his garment in her hand and he fled literally Ram and he went outside that's what it takes we are not called to mollify our flesh but to mortify it we are commanded by God as Christians to say enough is enough I won't give myself to that and I wonder thinking about Joseph if there's anyone here and there could well be somebody who's you're struggling with sexual temptation where you work there's somebody there that's a temptation to you and maybe it's a relational thing maybe it's just a physical thing but it's it's a 10 or maybe it's actually in your neighborhood it's where you live there's somebody that has become a temptation to you and you say yeah I have that problem Bob I don't know what to do let me suggest what you should do quit your job move from where you live you say well that's that's overreaction isn't that crazy why would I do that well I remember what Jesus said if your eye offends you pluck it out if your hand offends you if it causes you to sin cut it off you say well he was just using exaggeration wasn't he he was I had a neighbor he wound up with gangrene in his foot the doctor said you have a choice we can cut off your foot or you can die it's pretty simple you got to make a really hard choice here which isn't gonna be he said take the foot and I think sometimes when it comes to sins like well there's got to be another way can't we just you know do a foot massage can we do a you know go to the eye doctor we do too little and we wind up in too deep somebody would say to me Bob is it okay for a Christian to go to a party where there you know there's drinking is it okay to go to a club is it okay to go out socially drinking with your non-christian friends that I question the question see the question isn't how close can I get to sin without falling into it the question a Christian should be asking is how far can I stay away from sin how close to the Savior can I remain jot down proverbs 16 and verse 17 here's what it says the highway an interesting word in Hebrew it means a", "road that has been lifted up so that you can move smooth and fast and straight the highway of the upright I pray that you the righteous is to depart from evil literally to bypass it to go right over it to go around it he who watches his way preserves his life put this down not only we to run away from sin and temptation but number two we need to run after Christ's likeness run after Christ's likeness so the person who's holy his is a runner running away from sin but running toward the Lord look at verse 11 flee from these you man of God and pursue righteousness godliness faith love perseverance and gentleness the word pursue in the original language as the word Fugo we get our word fugitive the idea is that you're running for your very life the pictures of the in the Bible about running are often described to us for our spiritual pursuits for instance we are told in first Corinthians Paul says do you not know all that running a race run but not all win run to win make it about winning here this is about the pursuit the most important race you'll ever be and don't run half-heartedly Bible says we're to put aside the sin that so easily entangles us and run with endurance the race that is set before us looking to Jesus the author and the perfecter of our faith go in pursuit of these things are you are you going after them with a reckless abandonment you know I became a police officer and I'll be very honest part of the reason I became a cop is for the excitement that I would enjoy and chasing bad guys I admit it I wanted to put bad guys in jail I remember the first pursuit I was ever in it was around midnight it was La Habra it was I just got gotten on shift on graveyard shift and the call came out of a to assist another officer up at the north end on Whittier Boulevard and I headed that way and as I was coming to where he was he started shouting in his walkie talkie 245 on an officer 245 on enough sir that means assault with a deadly weapon on him and I didn't know what had happened that's all he said but he was screaming and as I drove in he pointed at a car that was taking off up the street and so I I gave chase I put on my lights and my siren I started chasing the suspect and all I", "knew is that he had tried to kill or tried to hurt this other police officer my friend and the guy would not stop for me so I began a code three chase unfortunately for me it north of La Habra and if you know your geography you know the harbor's the northwestern most city in Orange County so what that means is that we very quickly were out of my city we were up in the LA County a place that I'm not familiar with it was late at night and this guy that I'm chasing knows where I don't and so I'm driving as quickly as I can he is trying to get away from me and he's not pulling over and I'm alone behind him and all I know is he's tried to kill or tried to hurt this other police officer don't know how and as I'm chasing him what I'm driving extremely quickly he's driving over he said were going through red lights it's very dangerous there are cars still out so Friday night and we wind up going I remember through Colima Road there were lots of cars there and he's just blowing the lights and I'm thinking man I sure hope somebody knows where I am the problem is my radio frequency would not broadcast back to my department because I was out of my County but a police officer at least in the 70s when I was a cop had a button they could push to broadcast to the whole of Orange County every police officer in Orange County would hear it's called red Channel I punched our bread Channel unfortunately as soon as I pushed the button a pursuit was starting down in Garden Grove another police officer was going in pursuit and so I could not use that frequency besides which I'm out of the county anyway and literally I could not communicate to the police officers pack horn in in Orange County and La Habra I couldn't talk to anybody so I was alone in fact at one point a black and white Sheriff's Department officer deputy got behind me but we lost him we drove too fast for him so I'm alone for about 20 minutes wine way up in the hills in in LA up there and this guy goes up the steep driveway remember I got lights and siren gone the whole time and we wind up at a house he jumps out of the car I'm only seconds behind him I jump out of the car and I think this is it I take out my gun I say freeze he doesn't obey", "me I don't know why he runs for the front door he runs I start running behind him he runs through the front door shuts the door I didn't even think he probably didn't have time to lock it I didn't even try the door I just like tried the door with my foot and the door literally came off the hinges he was standing inside them the it was kind of shocked when the door hit him and then I took my gun when I shoved it into his stomach I said you're going he said no I'm not I said yes you are I said no I'm not and then he looked at my gun he said I don't have a gun and I thought okay so I put mine away I was not thinking very well gotta be fair here but my gun away and we started to fight and we wound up down on the ground long story short I wound up helping him go to sleep for a little while he needed to go to sleep for a few seconds so that I could get my handcuffs on him and I got him into custody but I remember that night there was the sense that I had they didn't matter what it would take I would not let him get away from me I did not know what he had done I didn't know how he had tried to hurt he actually tried to run over the other police officer that was the assault with a deadly weapon turned out but at the time there was something inside of me that said no matter what as long as I'm alive I'm gonna try to take him into custody that's what it means for a police officer to go in pursuit when Paul says Timothy you got to pursue these things in other words you've got to put aside everything else when a cop goes into pursuit he doesn't window-shop as he goes by storz he doesn't pull through jack of the box like the old commercial showed the bad guy pulled you don't do Paul said no soldier engaged in active service entangles himself in the affairs of everyday life so that he may please the one who enlisted him it is a complete 100 percent focus so pulses Timothy you're gonna have to flee certain things but you're gonna have to pursue spiritual fruit that's the list here righteousness and godliness by the way those two words there's three sets of two here righteousness and godliness righteousness speaks of your conduct it speaks of practical integrity the", "things that you do and the reasons you do them and then godliness speaks of personal piety your worship and reverence of God the motivation from the way you live you see faith and love those two come together all through the New Testament what really matters Paul says to the Galatians is faith working through love not circumcision that the ceremonies mean nothing really they won't commend you to God but faith working through love and then perseverance and meekness and those are reference to how were to respond to opposition perseverance means I stick to it I'm gonna I'm gonna abide under that's what the Greek word means and meekness means that I'm not about me in other words I'm gonna stay in it but I'm gonna keep low I'm not gonna be in this whole thing for myself and so Paul does describes spiritual fruit or what we might call Christ likeness Lord I want to be like Jesus Christ being a man of a woman of God means that we're living with a singular purpose we understand it's a singular privilege to be called that but also with a singular provision for how we're going to do it jot down second Timothy 3:16 and 17 and the reason I give you this passage it's the only other place that the phrase man of God is used in the New Testament and it's every one of us listen to what it says all Scripture is god-breathed inspired by God it's profitable for teaching for reproof for correction for training in righteousness so that the who say it out loud the man of God may be adequate equipped for every good work the Bible is given to the man of God so that we can be everything that God wants us to be while most books inform and a few books reform God's Word is the only book that transforms it's the only book that you have you've read many books maybe you only have one that reads you it's the Bible it is different than every other book Martin Luther said the Bible is alive it speaks to me it has feet it runs after me it has hands it lays hold of me the Bible breaks hard hearts and it heals broken hearts someone said this the best thing to do with the Bible is to know it in the head stow it in the heart so it in the world and show it through your life it's not enough to say you've gone through the Bible you need the Bible to go through you you see God's Word must live inside", "of you and affect the way that you live it's been said and I agree we when a Christian bleeds we should bleed Bible not what Jesus did on the cross my God my God why have you forsaken me he's quoting Psalm 22:1 that's your worst moment in life and it should be the Word of God that that interprets what's going on in your life we should speak Biblia should be our second language you see and so the Word of God is able to equip us studying the Bible will make us wise believing the Bible will make us safe but practicing the Bible will make us holy so we need to flee and we need to follow then put this down let it be know how to fight and hold firm to your faith look at verse 12 fight the good fight of faith take hold of eternal life to which you were called and you made the good confession in the presence of many witnesses now that's interesting but Paul said to Timothy I wonder how many of you it could be applied to you've made the good confession before many witnesses now Paul says fight the good fight there are some fights that are not what we would call good fights there are some fights that are just mistakes you can get into all kinds of arguments with people that you shouldn't and you can do it a you know around spiritually and you shouldn't argue about the nature of election with people I pitted in arguments like that don't bother just make your own calling an election sure of the Bible says you see by the way you live focus there don't focus I'm trying to get everybody else to believe exactly like you believe in this true story and elderly Florida lady did her shopping and upon returning to her car found four men in the act of leaving with her vehicle she dropped her shopping bags drew a handgun and proceeded to scream at the top of her lungs I have a gun and I know how to use it get out of the car the four men didn't wait for a second invitation they got out and they ran for their lives the lady somewhat shaken then proceeded to load her shopping bags into the backseat of the car and got into the driver's seat she was so shaken she couldn't get the key into the ignition she tried and tried and then it dawned on her it wasn't her car oops after fighting her car four or five spaces farther down she loaded the bags", "in the correct car drove to the police station to report her mistake the sergeant to whom she told the story couldn't stop laughing he pointed to the other end of the counter where four men were reporting a carjacking by a crazy elderly woman with a gun you know we could be so sure of ourselves and so humiliated at the end there's an ancient story of two gladiators who met and they were commenting on a statue and one of them said to the other one it's an amazing gold statue and the other one said you Frank gold it's silver you idiot that's gold you can tell he said no it's silver is stupid or they just started into this verbal argument they became a fight they fought with they took their swords out literally one impaled the other one a mortal wound the other one was able to injure the other guys one dies there the other one is gonna die and as he's dragging himself away he goes around that this statue and realizes one half of it was gold and one half of it was silver see we could be so we're right and so offensive in the process that is not the good fight that's not what God's calling us to do put this down we are called to contend for the truth we are called to do that in fact the little epistle Jude he says I'm writing this to tell you you got to contend for the faith contend for the truth there are false teachers but when we talk about fighting the good faith it's really clear from Scripture our faith our fight I should say is not with an unsaved world it's with an unseen world ruler Bible says we wrestle not against flesh and blood can I remind you that who are struggling with your husband right now can I remind you of that who are struggling with your children right now can I remind you of that Christian who are struggling with your boss or somebody else you're struggling with some person if if you are you think no they're my problem Satan is already one you're fighting the wrong enemy Paul says we wrestle not against flesh and blood but some of us are stopped realize their spiritual powers behind influencing and your enemy are not human being saved or unsaved for whom Jesus died maybe they're captive by the enemy maybe they're deceived by the enemy but let's remember who our enemy really is we need to be involved in the spiritual battle I often say it this way", "if hell has a post office wouldn't you want your mug shot on its wall wouldn't you want to be a threat to the enemy I think we need to get it clear who our enemy really is if we're gonna fight the good fight we're to be like the workers on the wall in nehemiah's day it says when they would show up to work to build the wall they came with a trowel in one hand and a sword in the other because there were enemies yes we're building we're here to build and edify one another up we come with a trowel but we also come to do battle on behalf of each other and because the enemy is looking on we want to build we want to battle we want to defend the faith and we want to defeat the enemy you know I don't know how you feel about this but I feel strongly about it there is a time for every one of us who are believers to be what I would call good and angry good and angry no most of the time anger is just a dangerous thing I like to say you know anger is about 5/6 of danger most anger just needs to be put away but be careful there is some truth about this there is a tie to be good and angry the Bible says be angry it's a command did you know that and sin not that's the tough part we usually get the first part down no problem there all right fulfilled battle the way to church today the guy cut me off my kids weren't ready no be angry but sin not jot down mark 3 and verse 5 if you want to be like Jesus you're gonna have to be says after looking around at them these are the men and the people who were trying to see if he was going to heal on the Sabbath it was a man with a withered hand and they were watching Jesus to see if he would heal him looking around at them with anger it says grieved at their hardness of heart Jesus said to the man stretch out your hand he stretched out as him and he was restored when he turned the tables over in the temple twice the beginning of his ministry at the end Jesus was upset primarily because the Gentiles who were coming to pray to God and God said my house she'll be a house of prayer for all the nations all the but there in the and that in the court of the Gentiles are where the", "Caiaphas had set up the bazaars of Anna's the money changing and the selling of animals there was no way that a Gentile could come and focus and pray it was distracting and they were making money and ripping people off and Jesus was incensed what they had done to his father's house there's a time to be good and angry let me just say this we need to be vexed at our culture's depravity we need to be careful to stuff to think well you know I don't really feel deeply about that anymore because I'm growing in grace and I'm growing in my kindness and so it doesn't bother me anymore don't make that your excuse for really desensitization to sin I want you to jot down second Peter 2 in verse 8 speaking of Lots though he was a man who had God's approval he lived among the people of sodom and gomorrah each day was like torture to him as he saw and heard the immoral things that the people did interesting lot of all people should become an example to us of anything he's a man who though he knows God makes a bunch of bad choices about where he lives and where he raises his family he's certainly not commendable to us on a lot of levels but even lot has a lot to say about this issue to us even in his compromised condition it to use King James language it vexed him every day when he saw the wickedness of the people around him have you read of this brand-new New York abortion law how many of you have heard what I'm talking about making it legal to kill a baby in the womb up to the time of its birth friends it's interesting to me it's tragic to me its border structures are immoral but taking the lives of innocent babies in or out of the womb is not America listen have we perverted our definition of morality taking innocent children from their parents at the border is wrong I agree but killing innocent babies at the border to their birth is so far from wrong you declare it a right I want to remind all of us are the words of Isaiah and the warning of Thomas Jefferson Isaiah said woe to those who call evil good and good evil who substitute darkness for light and light for darkness and Jefferson of all people said I tremble for my country when I reflect that God is just and that his sleep forever there is a time to be good and angry there's a time to deal with", "the sin of our nation but we need to be wise in the way we do it here's a question I want to ask you if you get to heaven when you get to heaven if you're saved and you meet one of the unborn 's who are taken out of their mother's womb and they come up to you and ask you this question did you ever speak up for me did you ever speak up for me what would be your answer please jot down proverbs 31 verses 8 and 9 proverbs 31 8 speak out for the one who cannot speak for the rights of those who are doomed speak out judge fairly and defend the rights of the oppressed and the needy people this is the command of God for us we must speak out for those who don't have a voice now I know I believe me I know the answer to what I am saying I live in California I cannot affect the laws of the state of New York or Virginia let me remind you something that I think speaks to this was a little five-year-old boy with his mom and dad at a restaurant he was Jonathan he's sitting at the table they're getting ready to order food and the waitress asked little boy Jonathan what he would like he says I'll have a grilled cheese sandwich she says oh we don't we don't have grilled cheese sandwiches on the menu we don't serve those he says well you have a grill don't you she says well yeah he says you have cheese don't you she said sure said you have bread said yeah he said okay then all the girl cheese sandwich so even those on the menu the waitress goes back and says you know talks to the chef and she come down she says okay he's agreed to make you a grilled cheese sandwich she said but I did forget to get your drink order he says well of a milkshake she says oh she was she goes I you know I thought you might ask that she said but I'm sure your mom and dad told you we don't have milkshakes she said but let me just say we do have milk we do have ice cream but we do not he said you have a car do you have a voice do you cuz I don't right now it's last week do you have a voice then use it do you have a vote then cast it when you can find a petition there are petitions to sign for your opposition to", "those things that are happening out of state sign it even better yet create your own petition to God because as I read scripture that's where things change if my people who are called by my name will humble themselves it doesn't say and sign a petition it says pray that's your petition ask God God turned this around God showed me what you want me to do god help me to not say oh this is not good how do you want to use me Lord to be salt I think we should our prayer should be Lord let my life lead a very clear trail of salt in my generation that reflects a violated conscience and a broken heart like yours I want to be angry but I want to be good and angry Jesus I want to deal with sin you were willing to die for it you didn't just come and preach against it you gave your life for it because you loved the people that were committing it we're called to contend for the truth and then put this down live consistent with your calling and your confession those are the texts fight the good fight of faith take hold of eternal life to which you were hauled and you made a good confession in the presence of many witnesses the call of God that Paul is referring to is that moment where Jesus Christ called you to become his follower and you responded it's sometimes called the universal call the general call to salvation jesus said many are called few are chosen the call of God on mankind is to repent of his sins have you done that and come to Christ it's a private invitation from God himself timothy paul ii remember when you did that see I don't know where that brings you back to I know what brings me back to I remember the night where I was told how I could have Jesus Christ as my Lord and Savior I I already thought I was a Christian but I didn't know I needed I could receive him where did that happen Paul says I remember Timothy you were called to you you forgotten your calling and then he talks about his confession before many witnesses what's he most likely in this case is baptism when there were people watching when Timothy publicly profess Christ one was private that calling the other one was very public when he said I'm following Jesus Christ he died for me and now I want to die to myself and live for him and Paul says you need to take hold of eternal", "life a lot of people misunderstand eternal life eternal life is not living please remember this eternal life is not about living for eternity in terms of duration why because everybody lives for eternity everybody lives forever the human soul is eternal the question remember is the old real estate question location location location you will live forever the question is where read revelation 20 but this is eternal life that they may know the only true God in Jesus Christ to me a cent it's not about living forever it's about experiencing the life that comes from the eternal one the life that God decides you for to be in relationship with God you see for your sin to be forgiven and for you to discover what life was made for that's eternal life and that doesn't begin when you die in fact they can't begin after you die if it has to begun before you die that's why that bumper sticker is so theologically correct more than once die twice born twice he'll die once you'll never be separated from God you'll experience eternal life you won't die in the biblical sense of being separated from God ever because you have eternal life you've passed from death to life already Jesus says but you need to get a grip on the reality of eternal life Paul says listen I want you to run from sin and temptation I want you to run toward spiritual fruit and Christlikeness I want you to fight the right fight but I want you to live consistent with that calling remember Jesus in John 14 he spoke of the rapture there's not a lot of verses in the Gospels that speak of the rapture but there is one Jesus in John 14 said fear not let not your hearts be troubled you believe in God believe also in me for in my father's house are many dwelling places if it were not so I would have told you then he said this I go to prepare a place for you that where I am you may be also and if I go I will come again and take you to myself after the rapture that you may be where I am Jesus bodily a sudden that he fulfilled his promise he went to heaven he's coming back do you know in the Old Testament in the Book of Numbers God come in that his people would wear what was called a seat it was a honor hem it was Kord of blue they were to wear a quart of blue every one of them it was as though no matter what you're going", "through the children of Israel walking through the wilderness wondering when are we gonna get to the problem slim as you would look down at your dusty feet hard day long day you would see this quart of blue that would remind you I believe of heaven you're going to heaven no matter what today was like you're going to heaven never forget that he's gonna fulfill that promise to bring us to himself get a grip on the reality of eternal life we used to sing a song I don't want to be a casual Christian I mean that I don't want to be a casual Christian I don't want to live a lukewarm life I want to light up the night with an everlasting light how you guys doing with that you feel like your Christian life has become compromised have you become desensitized to sin have you stopped fighting the right enemy listen the Bible is clear we reap what we sow it's just a universal principle Bible says if you sow to the flesh you'll reap from the flesh corruption you sow to the spirit you'll reap from the spirit eternal life it's kind of mathematical we know this it's talking here about taking hold of the life we have seizing it it's a word that literally means to arrest or to grip hold of it with all that we have kinda like carpe diem seize the day Lord I want to live this life for you 100% I mean if I wanted to grow some I don't know tomatoes in my backyard somebody gave me some tomato seeds and I walked in my back door opened the glass door and I just throw them out there next day I give a glass of water open the glass every day faithfully and then a couple weeks later after doing that expect to have juicy ripe tomatoes you'd say can't grow anything that way that's right and a lot of times Christians are not diligent about taking hold of eternal life and going for it or sloppy we're lazy with it we expect you just to happen on its own doesn't work that way now you're not saved because of your diligence but your enjoyment of salvation your ability to fully reflect God and glorify God has everything to do with your diligence you will reap what you sow and many of us in this room already know that we are I want you to jot down philippians 4 in verse 12 listen to what Paul said Philippians well that's Philippians 4:12 already but I think I wanted 312 so which you can't", "help me with that was my mistake Philippians chapter 3 Paul is talking about his pursuit of his life and I will oldschool turn there here's what Paul says not that I have already obtained it perfection or have already become perfect but I press on so that I may hear it is lay hold of that for which also I was laid hold of by Christ Jesus was Paul saying he's saying the day that I got saved on the road to Damascus Jesus laid hold of me he it's a word that means to be arrested he took me down and my life now is to pursue the things I want to lay hold of the goal of the upward call of God the prize of being like Christ it consumes Who I am I pray it does for you too would you agree with this statement I grew at the sea I'd rather boil for the Lord for five more years then sit on the spiritual back shelf for 35 more I'd rather my life count for the kingdom of God however long God might give me you see Paul's epitaph was what he told Timothy to do in 2nd Timothy Paul will say I have fought the good fight I finished the course I have kept the so many have begun the course but they're not going to finish the course finishing is not an important thing it's everything she said those who endure to the end shall be saved our enduring our abiding in Christ to the end faithful is evidence that were really saved jot down revelation 3:20 I know many of you know this verse jesus said behold I stand at the door I knock if anyone hears my voice there's the call and opens the door that's our job I will come into him and I'll dine with him and he with me you know it's an interesting thing about revelation 3:20 is that it's Jesus talking to his own church what in the world is Jesus doing on the outside of his church why would Jesus be knocking at the door to his own church saying let me in I can't help what I see that I think you're Fred Flinstone the end of every show right he puts the saber-tooth kitty outside who jumps back in the window and locks him out well their bedrock everybody's waking up cuz Fred who owns the house is locked outside the house and we laugh but Jesus is outside the house your house that he bought that you say he's your Savior your Lord what's he doing out there", "or maybe you've never you've never opened the door to him didn't know you could didn't know he shouldn't know how to you know what I got to tell you something I wasn't sure I was going to be able to speak this morning I Don Stewart on a short call to come if I needed him and if I could only give one more message with my that was it that was I was done I would appeal to anybody who's never opened the door to Christ to come to him I would say please here is call it starts there you've got it you got to hear the call you've got to open the door you've got to say Jesus you want me you want me to let you in you want me to ask for forgiveness you want to give me eternal life and you want me to to be not only forgiven of my sin but to know that when I dialed but I have it what a deal of course I would say who who says no to that who locks Jesus out maybe you've never ever heard him call you and I'm telling you today he is I know so many of us here have come to Christ you're born again my second question is is have you publicly confessed him have have you come forward and an altar call to say I'm a follower of Jesus Christ you see for to many Christians baptism is a ceremony in their past that celebrates what Christ did 2,000 years ago let me taste of me baptism is not supposed to be just a ceremony it's supposed to be a testimony of how you're living every day you were saying I'm gonna die today so my sentence is not what Jesus said if anyone wishes to come after me let him take up his cross daily that's the Gospel of Luke daily Paul said I die daily so what does that mean it means that you wake up as a Christian say I don't want to die to my sin and I want to live to my Savior or live for his glory I don't want to be controlled anymore by the things that I have been I don't want to be worldly I don't want to be a casual Christian I want to be a non-fire Christian I want to fight and I want to win for Christ and so I can't think of a better way to end the message than to give an opportunity for you maybe you've never responded to the call you didn't know you were called to do", "anything but you are he's knocking whether you're a Christian who's far away or you've never responded you didn't know you could you didn't know you should I want to give you a chance or maybe say Bob I have responded to the call privately but I've never publicly confessed Christ before many witnesses I want to give you a chance to do that in the time we have I want to give you a chance to get out of your seat come down here and with this raspy voice that I've invite you to pray to receive Christ as your Lord and Savior to say Jesus I'm not locking you out of my life I'm not walking away pretending no one's knocking or I hear you're knockin but you can't come in I want you to be my Savior fill in these final blanks to be holy his you're saying basically this prayer Lord I choose to live with a spiritual passion with an eternal perspective and in line with your eternal purpose for my life put in the words passion perspective and purpose you to bow your head in prayer and I want to talk right now to the Lord about everyone including me I want you to be honest to God about where you're at I was just reading this morning in the Psalms where this the psalmist said Lord we can't sing your songs from a foreign land and I was thinking how hard it is to worship God when you're far away from him because of your sin how hard it is you feel like you're a spectator watching other people who know God watching other people who love God even though you know you should even though you used to and I'm gonna just pray right now that God would touch your heart ma'am sir if you want Jesus Christ to be your Lord and Savior maybe you have responded to that private call an invitation but you've never responded to the public confession Jesus said if you'll confess me before men I'll confess it before my father you say well Bob everybody knows me that I'm a Christian but I've never publicly confessed him I invite you to do that then today or maybe you've never opened the door he didn't know you you could you didn't know you didn't

all right well let's have you open your bibles uh back to leviticus maybe you have been in leviticus long enough it just opens itself up to leviticus when you open your bible but we're in leviticus 19 i didn't make it all the way through my message last week so undelay amigo here leviticus 19 beginning in verse leviticus 19 13 and we'll see how far we get you shall not oppress your neighbor nor rob him the wages of a hired man are not to remain with you all night until morning you shall not curse a deaf man nor place a stumbling block before the blind but you shall revere your god i am the lord you shall do no injustice and judgment you shall not be partial to the poor nor defer to the great but you are to judge your neighbor you shall not go about as a slanderer among your people and you are not to act against the life of your neighbor i'm the lord you shall not hate your fellow countrymen in your heart you may surely reprove your neighbor but you shall not because of him you shall not take vengeance nor bear any grudge against the sons of your people but you shall love your neighbor as yourself i am the lord you are to keep my statutes my commands you shall not breed together two kinds of your cattle you shall not sow your field with two kinds of seed nor wear a garment upon you of two kinds of material mixed together", "now if a man lies carnally with a woman who's a slave acquired for another man but who has in no way been redeemed nor given her freedom there shall be punishment they shall not however be put to death because she was not free he to the doorway of the tent of meeting a shall also make atonement for him with lord for his sin which he has committed and the sin which he has committed will be forgiven him let's stop there father tonight as we get into this text we ask that you would give us the your heart to understand that what you were telling israel and what you're saying to the church lord as jesus said over and over again let him who has ears to hear what the spirit is saying to the churches lord we know that this text is for us and that you want to help us to grow and understand how to live a holy life in a very ungodly world so be with us encourage us and teach us in jesus name amen you can be seated i think we got through this fill-in but um i it's a different fill-in set of fillings for a night so put in the word reduces reduces the need for a list of rules now just if you're visiting with us or you don't remember in chapter 19 we're talking in chapter 18 as well we're talking about the importance of being holy let's just go back to the very beginning of the chapter very briefly to hear how he introduces all the things he's talking about the lord spoke to moses saying speak to all the congregation of the sons of israel and say to them you shall be holy why for i the lord your god am holy and the rest of this chapter is all about that that god is explaining what holiness in real life in real relationships and circumstances of our life rather than this this idea this concept of being set apart for god i'm his i'm special all that's true but what does it mean in terms of the way that we live and he's talking of course to the nation of israel he calls them the sons of israel we need to remember that yes he's talking to the the people who were descended from jacob whose name was changed to israel and why was jacob's name changed to israel somebody remind us of why why that happened when that happened anybody have a say that one more time a little louder okay in genesis 32 jacob is coming back", "his brother esau who last he knew wanted to kill him and he fear still does is coming with hundreds of men to meet him and probably in his mind kill him and so jacob who is coming back from having lived with laban for 20 years and has well two wives and two concubines and 12 sons and all kinds of cattle and wealth is afraid his brother is going to kill him and kill his family and so he is struggling and and not sure what to do and he separates his family out so that if he if esau attacks one part of his family the other part of the family might get away and the bible says simply he was left alone everybody else is gone and jacob is all alone and this night genesis 32 he at the banks of the jabock river he gets into a wrestling match with this this person he doesn't know who it is we know because we've read the passage it's actually an angel of the lord but he thinks it's an enemy and they fight and they struggle and the angel puts enough effort into the battle that that uh jacob can't win he doesn't lose they're just kind of evenly matched and then the angel reaches out and touches jacob on the thigh and literally dislocates his leg just instantaneously just like power comes out of this angel and somehow jacob seems to realize he's been wrestling not with some enemy but a representative of the lord it's the angel of the lord and now instead of fighting or trying to get away from the angel jacob everything changes jacob is now clinging he's crippled and he's hanging on to him and he says i don't i'm not going to go unless you bless me and you know and what's your name and all these things that happens what's interesting it's in this situation where jacob is is from that point on in his life he he leaves and he's limping until the very end of his life we see him leaning on his staff in hebrews he's from that moment to the moment he dies he'll never take another step without pain without being dependent on you know like a staff his name gets changed from yakov he'll catch her to israel a prince with god or one who is governed by god and so the sons of israel that the lord is speaking to are yes the descendants of abraham isaac and jacob or israel but folks we need to see how he's speaking to us he is speaking", "to his people who are a people whose name has been changed because their nature has been changed that's you that's me god's saying you are to be because i'm holy you are sons of israel that is you are like israel god is if you've met the lord he has taken you like jacob was self-centered israel is one who was god governed and that's what your testimony is if you're that the lord is now in charge of your life but what does that look like in real life in everyday living and so we're gonna we've been talking about it we'll talk again a lot of particulars tonight but this idea of love reduces the need for a list of rules in verses through 18 we see how love is a part of the law usually we think of the law and we think that has nothing to do with love and yet it's to it and so in verse 13 again you shall not oppress your neighbor nor rob him the wages of a hired man are not to remain with you all night until morning in other words if you hire somebody you don't and you can pay and you're supposed to pay them remember james talks about this the cry of your labors has come up to the lord's sabbath oath and you're not treating your your hired people with justice you shall not curse a deaf man nor place a stumbling block before the blind obviously that's being super cruel you're taking advantage of someone's and offending them but god says they might be blind but i'm not they might be deaf but i'm not i can i hear what's what you're doing but you shall revere your god in other words your relationships the way you treat people should be affected by the fact that god is watching everything you're doing so number one on that on the outline is fear god and love your neighbor that's really what it comes down to our fear of god because we're his children we walk before him we are our neighbor how many commands are there in the old testament how many raise your hand so i know that you're yelling something out because i heard you say it but i couldn't hear what you said what how many ten well actually there's a lot more old testament total commandments according to the rabbis there are actually 613 i did not count them but i take the rabbis over all these years i figured 613 commandments by the way the rabbis actually break those down for us into two kinds of commandments there are", "positive commandments thou shalt there are 248 of those and then negative commandments thou shalt not there are well 365 of those it just happens to be there's a negative commandment for every day so you can have your own little devotional calendar with thou shalt not but it is true they are reduced in a sense to the ten uh they're called in hebrew the ten words but the ten we call them the ten commandments of god that incorporate the moral teachings of the law and then in the book of micah and many of you remember the old song that we used to sing he has shown the o man what is good and what the lord requires of thee this is micah 6 8 but those 10 are actually reduced down to three remember what are they love mercy and walk humbly with your god you know i personally like it when big long lists get reduced because it's easier for for me to remember them um you know in 1967 did a song with the beatles uh some of us were alive and listening back then uh were they saying all you need is love love is all you need 1900 years before paul mccartney sang that song there was who wrote about the same thing that love is all you need it's romans 13 and verse you remember romans 13 and verse paul said this love does no wrong to a neighbor love therefore is the fulfillment of the law literally love is all you need and jesus spoke of this himself in matthew 22 verses 36 through 40 jesus was asked and talking someone about the greatest commandment teacher which is the greatest commandment in the law they said and jesus said to him you shall love the lord your god with all your heart soul mind and strength that's deuteronomy 6 the shema with all your soul with all your mind this is the great and foremost commandment the is like it you shall love your neighbor as yourself coming right here from leviticus 19 on these two commandments depend the whole law and the prophets and by the way the law in the prophets is a phrase that describes all of god's revelation in the old testament the law and the prophets everything that god had to say to man is is understood to be fulfilled by the law so if you love the lord and if you love your neighbor you won't need a list of rules because you won't violate god's commands you see if you love your neighbor you're not going to steal from your neighbor", "you're not going to commit adultery with his wife or his you know her husband you won't do that because you love them you won't be jealous over and coveting what they have you'll be happy for them don't bear false witness in other words love is the fulfillment of the law so as believers we are to be filled with the holy spirit and the fruit of the spirit well it's love you know so love truly is all we need now in verse 16 he talks about you shall not go about as a slanderer by the way the name devil the word devil it's not really a proper name lucifer is one of satan's names the word devil in spanish what's how do you pronounce it in spanish diablo is actually like straight from the greek by the way sometimes in spanish they just go straight to the greek the english changes it but not not in spanish diop dia is a preposition it means a cross and balo is where we get our word ballistic in english it means to throw or to hurl to cast edema is ekbala to throw him out so diablo is actually a word that means to hurl something across and the idea is that the devil is one who is the accuser of the brethren revelation 12 10 he is slandering us before god but praise the lord we have a great high priest an advocate with the father whoever lives to make intercession for us in hebrews 7 25 that's jesus now we are not to go about as a devil or as a slanderer among our people and we're not to act against the life of our neighbor very interesting so jot down proverbs 20 and verse 19. he who goes about as a slanderer reveals therefore do not associate with a gossip it's been said and i like this great minds talk about ideas great minds talk about ideas and ideas good minds talk about events small minds talk about other people and it's a good question to ask well which one am i lauren god doesn't want us to be a person who hates verse 17 you shall not hate your fellow countrymen remember jesus in the sermon on the mount would say you've heard it said thou shalt not kill not commit murder but i say to you if you hate your brother in your heart you're going to be liable you're going to answer to god because actually the root sin of murder is hate it starts with cain hated his brother and then he becomes a murderer", "it's hatred at the core level you shall not hate your fellow countrymen in your you can reprove your neighbor you know it's funny because if you think a lot of us struggle sometimes people hurt us and we get very angry and and forms inside of us to where we want nothing to do to them if somebody brings up their name we don't want to be around them they could be a christian they could be at our church they could be somebody for at work but we hate them could be a family member we hate them and yet the bible commands us to reprove but we seldom do that to reprove means to admonish to speak truth to someone even if it might offend them but we're doing it because we love them the bible says speaking the truth and love this is ephesians 4 15 speaking the truth in love were to grow up in all aspects into him who was the head even christ christ spoke truth even though it offended people were offended jesus said they hate me because i tell them their deeds he just told the truth loved people here's the thing we don't do what we're supposed to do we're supposed to reprove one another in love we don't do that romans 15 14 is an important verse paul the apostle never been to rome yet he knew a few people there how do i know because the end of the book of romans he's qui he's david all these people that are there but there are a lot of he's never met he's never been to calvary chapel of rome in his life but he will be heading there later after he's written this he's writing it from corinth at the time but it's interesting what he says about that whole church who he's not even met him all in romans 15 14 he says for i myself am convinced that you yourselves all of them are full of goodness filled with all knowledge and able also to admonish it's a word in greek new the teo there's a term in counseling if you're familiar with psychological counseling christian counseling called neuthetic counseling it has to do with admonishing telling speaking truth to each other we as believers not because we've gone through psychological training or biblical as believers who have the holy spirit if we know the word of god are equipped to reprove one another we're supposed to be doing that and not just doing it some of us might say i'm happy to be called that ministry how bible will travel yeah you", "just disqualified yourself if you really look forward to reproving something you probably should never do it we probably won't like doing it because we're not wanting to offend people but we should love them enough to speak truth to them now here's the the really who do you have in your life who is willing to speak truth to you and when they do do you receive it do you receive it you know not right away after i get mad you kind the psalmist said let the righteous it'll be like oil upon my head let not my head refuse it in other words i i did it's hard but i'm so grateful somebody loves me enough it's been said you know an enemy will stab you in the back a true friend will stab you in the front they'll speak to your heart and tell you the truth about you but we not only need people like that we need to be people like that who are willing to reprove hatred is doesn't belong in the life of a believer toward anybody someone once said don't be a hater the devil is a hater he drinks haterade and but this issue of unforgiveness just because you're a christian doesn't mean you're just you don't have any problems if i ask you is there somebody you have not forgiven you say well i wish you wouldn't say it like that because immediately i think of these two three four eight people whatever but if you say i can't think of anybody we'll praise the lord but if you go yeah there's this one particular individual and i can't say that i've forgiven them now there are some christians who really don't understand forgiveness they think if they still are hurt by something that's happened they haven't forgiven by the way have nothing to do with forgiveness just so you know i have wounds in my body that i'll have the rest of my life that might just never fully heal right that doesn't mean i've forgiven somebody don't mix up pain and bad memories and it hurts with unforgiveness unforgiveness is something different that's where you willfully hold ought against somebody and would like to see them hurt and be punished for it now it also might in your mind be confused you don't really want to be in that person's life because you don't trust them there are people who you can forgive who you cannot trust you need to see the difference between those two but sometimes we say well yeah i don't trust them but really we haven't", "forgiven them so we don't want to be too easy on ourselves either it's been said unforgiveness is the acid that destroys the vessel that it's stored in and too often uh that's the case it was uh i remember hearing the story of general uh oglethorpe who lived during the days of john wesley oglethorpe and wesley were friends and oglethorpe i don't even know if he was a christian but he once said i forget and i never forgive and wesley said to him well then sir i you never sin if you don't forgive jesus said neither will your heavenly father forgive you in fact i share this all the time but in giving of the lord's prayer remember when you pray pray like this there are seven petitions and only one that jesus comments when he's done giving the prayer and it's this one if you fail to remember where to pray father forgive us our trespasses or our debts as as we forgive those who trespass against us in our prayer we don't just say god forgive me the lord forgive me to the degree that i forgive others and the idea is well how much can he forgive you then if he if you hold ought against somebody there's some part of your restoration lord that can't happen yet and so it's a big and important deal if we're going to be holy we're not going to be hating and we're not going to be holding on to grudges there's an old saying don't hold grudges grudges bite don't hold them put this down god's holiness must affect our decisions now in verses 19 through 21 there's a number of commands that god gives that don't seem to be very related to each other but they have to do with kind of mixing things so put this down what god has separated let no man join together if you know what moses said there after god made adam and eve in fact i quoted it at the at the conclusion of every uh wedding i do what god has joined together let no man separate but here it's the reverse well god has separated let no man join together look at verse 19. you are to keep my statutes you shall not breed together two kinds of so the first one has to do with two kinds of cattle and it gives us this principle there are some things god intends to stay separate you know usually we think of adding two things together and we get something of a sum something that's better something but there are times when you add or join", "two things together and it's actually a according to god first corinthians 15 33 gives us one that we have to live with and remember as we live in this world if we're gonna live holy uh do not be deceived bad company corrupts be careful about your relationships unbelievers be careful with your relationship with carnal believers if you're a spirit-filled christian you are hoping to influence them that's great but you need to say honestly are you being brought down in your relationship with the lord are you compromising your walk your attitudes your speech whatever it is be careful there are two things that god says do not mix well the bible says it this way in proverbs he who walks with the wise will be what what is a wise person according to somebody who has a right relationship with god and lives lives in it the fear of the lord is the beginning of wisdom so when the bible speaks of wisdom it's different than the world the world speaks of the right use of knowledge you can be smart but are you dumb in the way you figure out your life well you're a wise person if you have the right use of knowledge biblically it's much more than that it's more than the right use of knowledge it is actually the right motivation for why you do what you do because of your love and the fear of god the fear of the lord is the beginning of wisdom that's why the fool in the bible isn't just some dummy the fool has said in his heart there's no god it's the so keep that in mind so when the bible says he who walks with the wise will be wise be with people who love the lord like you do be with people who honor god like you do or you want to if you want to grow in your faith but bad company corrupts good morals then ii corinthians verses 14 through 17 a familiar passage usually you hear this passage taught on when we're talking to young people about dating or college students you know and you marry who you date and all this but it's not really in the context of marriage at all it's talking to all of us do not be bound together join together yoked together literally in the greek with for what partnership koinonia has righteousness and lawlessness what fellowship has light with darkness or what harmony has christ with satan or what has a believer in common with an unbeliever or what agreement has the temple of god with idols for we are the", "temple of the living god just as god said i will dwell in them and i will walk among them i'll be their god and they shall be my people therefore come out from their midst be separate sayeth the lord don't touch what is unclean and i will that god says hey don't don't join them together then he talks about two different kinds of seed look at verse 19 he says you shall not sow your field seed remember in the scriptures jesus told a parable man who planted wheat in his field but an enemy came by night and planted tares or the darnell which is a a plant that looks like wheat in its early stages but it's not wheat it's not something edible in fact it's poisonous uh to animals and you would never eat it and so you know uh but it's mixed in and the servants of the farmer said she would go out and try to you know yank out all the the darnell all the tears and he says no you you can't it's impossible you'll get them mixed up you'll if you start trying to figure out which one's the real deal you're going to mess up and you're going to hurt the wheat you've got to wait till it's harvest because at harvest wheat and the darnell look very different by the way there's on the wheat there's a head on the darnell there isn't and so we got to wait till the harvest and then when it's time and the harvest is a picture of the time when the lord comes and the judgment happens in other words in the kingdom of god there will be true and there will be well make believers there will be people who claim to be christians who are among us but they're not really saved and you can't go out and go yeah you're the real deal and ah you're a fakey you you can't do it in fact if you go around doing that you're gonna say to some christian you're not really a christian because they didn't do something you thought they should do or don't like the songs you like on the radio or i don't know whatever you're gonna offend you're gonna hurt and you may claim somebody's saved because of some experience they've had because they like going to church or whatever and that's not the measurement so we can't make those judgments but it's interesting jesus talked about this very thing about two different kinds of seeds luke 5 and verse 36 he was telling him a parable no one has", "from a new garment and puts it on an old garment remember this otherwise he will both tear the new and the piece from the new will not match the old so jesus also again here in our text just like he comments almost on this very passage you can't wear a garment upon you or don't uh wear a garment upon you of two kinds of material mixed together now it's not like some sin if you have some weird garment that's like that that's it's the principle that's behind it that god's trying to get at remember the priests were not allowed to wear a certain kind of fabric you remember what it was it was wool they weren't allowed to use wool and you think about it man well it comes from sheep right they were only to use and it's very interesting linen garments breathe wool does not so much breathe it's great if it's freezing outside to have wool on but the fact is he says you know dude don't mix those uh wool was wool becomes a a picture of that which makes you sweat the lord didn't want his doing the ministry sweating in other words i don't want you to be running around going that's a hard job i'm serving the lord just uh no no so he didn't want his priests wearing wool and here god says yeah don't try to it's kind of like this you can't mix grace and and legalism but just a little legalism you know no that that's that doesn't work but this down number two holiness means choosing to live pure sexually in verse 20. now if a man lies carnally i mean they're not married with a woman and it's a very particular situation the woman is a slave who's been acquired for um probably another slave but we don't know but who has in no way she's not been redeemed or given her freedom just notice this phrase there shall be punishment there's going to be punishment they're not going to be put because she was not free now it is interesting the only one who has to give is the man which is is interesting to me i suggests though we don't have it in the text that because he was a free man and she was a slave uh imposed himself on her took advantage of her perhaps because only man is having to present some kind of a sacrifice for his guilt but in any case the point is this holy living involves the way you live sexually and how you treat sex shut down first thessalonians", "4 verses 3 through 5. listen to what paul says it is god's will that you should be sanctified by the way whenever you see the word sanctified in the bible you need to know that it is it is in the original language the same word is holy or the word saint it means one who is holy you should be set apart you should be it's god's will that you live holy lives that you should avoid here's what a holy life is one who avoids sexual that each of you should learn to control your own body in a way that is holy and honorable not in passionate lust like the unbelievers who do not know god hebrews 13 4 let marriage be held in honor among all and let the marriage bid he's talking about the sexual relation the marriage bed be undefiled for fornicators and adulterers god will judge that's what he says there will be punishment in this case of sexual sin galatians 6 and verse 8 says for the one who sows to his own flesh shall reap from the flesh corruption but the one who sows to the spirit shall reap from the spirit eternal life it's been said many christians sowed their flesh all week and come to church and pray for a crop but it doesn't work that way you will reap what you sow and sexual sin god says there are consequences and so there are three things that happen in this text regarding the sexual sin there had to be confession of it in this case it was confessed to a priest the bible says confess your faults to one another and pray for each other that you might be healed then there was the actual sacrifice that was used as a covering for the sin if you will and then the cleansing and so what does it mean for us well it means when it comes to sin whether it's sexual sin or any kind of sin here's what god is saying don't excuse your sin don't deny your sin don't justify it don't rationalize it don't don't use other words well you know i'm just human it's a little you know it's a boo-boo you know no call it what the lord calls it when jesus had compassion on the woman caught in adultery john 8 he he he says go and sin no more can i just encourage you for yourself start there call it what god calls it it requires by the way the death of the lamb in our text when we sin any sin sexual sin or other", "sins jesus had to die for that to be forgiven we need to confess it we need to be covered and we need to be cleansed but we need to call it what god calls it put this down let her see know how to in your life as a believer in verse 23 when you enter the land and plant all kinds of trees for food you shall count their fruit as forbidden the actual hebrew says three years it shall be uncircumcised to you and it shall not be eaten but in the fourth year all its fruit shall be holy fifth year you're to eat of its fruit that its yield may increase for you i am the lord your god well we talk about spiritual fruitfulness uh here's talking you know agricultural fruitfulness but there's an application so the lord uses in john 15 this idea that he's the vine we're the branches and i want you to jot down a few of the passages from there john 15 verses 1 and 2. jesus said i'm the vine my father is the vine dresser every branch in me that does next page not bear fruit he takes away and every branch that bears fruit he prunes it that it may bear more fruit so as a christian are you being fruitful he said well i don't know what that means well are you living out the life of christ are you seeing christ's life lived through you his character growing in you that's what the fruit is the fruit of the spirit and the fruit jesus mentions in john 15 is the character the life of christ if you go through the nine-fold fruit of the spirit you'll see that all of those describe jesus christ by the way the armor of god as well it's all christ's life christ's character lived out in me and you remember paul said i was crucified with christ or i am literally he didn't say i was he says i am crucified with christ nevertheless i live yet not i but christ lives in me think of the branch the life of christ is coming out and it bears character fruit described in galatians 5 22. but you say well i'm not really sure there's much fruit coming from my life what do we need to do to become fruitful there's three things in our text here number one it requires patience and self-denial for the first three to four years fruit trees do not really produce fruit and normally just what god told them to do horticulturists tell us the same thing that you need to thin out", "the original fruit that comes you don't eat it you actually have to wait and that's pretty hard to do when you have a little bit of fruit but it's not grapefruit and you know there's an old saying that all for a branch to bear fruit the only thing that's required is that it stays connected don't you think about that jesus said abide in me and you'll bear much fruit you have to stay connected to him your sin separates you stay connected long enough then his life will produce fruit john 15 verses 4 and 5 abide in me and i in you as the branch cannot bear fruit of itself unless it abides in the vine so neither can you you abide in me i'm the vine you're the branches he who abides in me and i in he bears much fruit for apart from me you can do nothing so fruitfulness is the result of faithfulness abiding and waiting for god to do it galatians 6 and verse 9 speaks to this very thing paul says this let us not lose heart in doing good for in due time we shall reap if we do not grow weary now the flesh all of our flesh is but it's not remember patience is actually a fruit of the spirit at best i think we pray oh god make me patient right now uh so it requires patience and self-denial number two see your fruit as and glorifying to god uh in our text in verse 24 in the fourth year all of its fruit shall be praise lord so you're not going to eat it the first three years and the fourth year you don't get to eat it either but you get to dedicate it to the lord so put in the word holy and see it as glorifying god john 15 and verse 8 by this is my father glorified that you bear much fruit and demonstrate then you are my disciples we've become like remember what jesus said do your works in such a way that men can see your good works but glorify your father who is in heaven fruit is the super work of god it's supernatural in origin we're not the source of it we're just the channel of it we're the branch but the glory needs to go to him it's holy it's set apart for him and finally the fruit will bless you and it will increase so put in the word bless and increase verse 25. in the fifth year finally after you've waited and you've dedicated the thought in the", "fifth year you are to eat of its fruit that its yield may increase for you i am the lord your god very interesting so they those who waited those who allowed it to be pruned because it had to be pruned those first few years and then they dedicated it to the lord finally in the fifth year by the way five is the number associated with grace all through the bible in the fifth year you get to actually partake of it you get to enjoy it as well you know i remember hearing pastor chuck talk to he was talking about ministering the word of god on sunday morning and and in the bible studies and he said you know the holy spirit will use him in such a way and a lot of times he would say i don't realize god's you know sometimes people will come up and say that really blessed me and and uh you know he's encouraged by that and he used to say you know if you get blessed that's the lord you know if you're bored that's me but uh but he he was sharing one time how he would tune in because he you know he's on the radio he's so he could listen to himself and he was here at one time how he turned on the radio and it was him uh he was listening to him and he goes man i could just bless myself it it was awesome you know and we all laugh but the reality is he didn't mind acknowledging that because he realized it's the lord it's the lord that was using me and i get blessed by what god does through me it's not me and it was it sounded almost you know prideful but it wasn't at all it was just really humbling saying that was the so you'll be satisfied as god produces his fruit through you if you're patient if you'll dedicate yourself to the lord it will happen in his time but uh it's interesting because the as i said the fruit of the spirit according to galatians 5 22 is actually singular it's we think about all the nine things that are mentioned but it's technically it's it's singular the fruit singular not the fruits the fruit of the spirit is love and all the others are aspects of how god's agape love is lived out and expresses itself but having said that when paul writes to the church at thessalonica he said you love one another in fact the spirit of god has taught you to love one another he said", "but i urge you to excel still more in other words i don't care how far you've grown in loving people and i hope you are but there's always room to grow so this should be a fruit that we see but we should see it growing and increasing now letter d avoid being conformed to this world in verse 26 you shall not eat anything with the blood nor practice divination or soothe saying now we're going to get into a variety of practices and they'll give a verse or two on each one of them so we're going to just we'll talk about these briefly but jot down first peter 1 verses 14 and 15. peter in the new testament and leviticus here really do have some parallels peter which we're standing on sunday morning if you're not with us i encourage you to come but he says this to us in chapter 1 like the holy one who called you be holy yourselves also in all your behavior in other words uh he actually says because you're children of god you and i are to he he quotes basically directly from this chapter we're to be holy but i want you to notice it's in everything it's not just a church it's not just when you're around christians it's not just when you're singing christian songs and reading your bible and with you know in all your behavior in everything you do and so there's a number of things that are spoken of here that we need to look at and say well am i holy in in that area now when he says you shall not eat anything with blood you say well good i'm no problem with that man i don't like eating bloody things either i don't even like you know rare is disgusting whatever i don't know worldliness is when we start to simply like the world acts or we leave god out of the equation that's what it means by the way to be sometimes people think godless means super evil no it just means you leave god out he has nothing to do with it you're just living your life remember you're leaning on your own understanding you're not acknowledging him you're not asking for help that's godlessness remember joshua will get into a covenant with the gibeonites simply because he doesn't ask the lord that's godlessness joshua is a wonderful godly man but he does a godless thing why he doesn't pray about it doesn't ask he just uses his own judgment very easy to be godless as believers by simply leaving god out or saying i can't handle", "this decision because i've made it i have a picture of a snake that they we have that up there yeah this is kind that's a real snake um listen to this story a true story a woman in woodbridge virginia saw a rarity in her front yard a two-headed copperhead snake i'm not sure if that's the same one but the snake only has one heart and one set of lungs but each head has its own brain this leads to multiple problems both heads want to eat but since eating takes time the snake is vulnerable to predators for twice as long further each head wants to go its own way that means they can't respond as quickly when under attack even getting water can be precarious as one head can drain the other down when drinking an expert at the wildlife center of virginia said based on the anatomy it would be better for the right head to eat but it may be a challenge since the left head appears to be more dominant experts also say that these internal conflicts prevent these rare dual cephalic that's head creatures from living very long and i was thinking what a picture because here's what it says in james that the double-minded man is unstable in all his ways remember jesus said you can't serve god and man you you won't be successful you you can't have two you can't serve two masters and when we talk about worldliness we're talking about that tendency to want to obey the lord to follow the lord but also kind of wanting to fit in with the world and remember jesus said of his disciples in the high priestly prayer father i don't ask you to take them out of the but i ask you to keep them from the wicked one and so we say we are in but not of the world uh we need to be in the world how can we fulfill the great commission if we're not in the world at all we're to be salt and light how will salt work if it's never taken out of the cabinet and poured on anything there's no contact it won't work it does nothing so we know where we need to be in the world until the lord takes us home but we are not to be of the world but therein lies the problem remember a boat should be in the water that's where boats are made to be in the water but water should not be in the boat that's when things get really dicey for a boat in the same way a", "believer is to be in the world that's where we're supposed to be but the world is not supposed to be if you will in us in verse 26 he talks about not eating things with blood which much of the ancient world did the world if you will from god's perspective the value of blood now the reason god we've studied this said you're not to eat blood it was not really about hygiene it was about the life is in the blood and therefore you don't eat it the blood is given by god in the animals to be a sacrifice and ultimately in christ for the expiation the removal of sin for cleansing but when the world just uses it as food it's not treating it as holy and that's what the problem is now when i say that that the world's view of blood or life is devalued i think we all would agree with that i was just reading i think we have a chart these are the leading causes of death uh here uh the the for top eight twenty percent uh uh this is during one particular year recently here in the united states 696 962 people died of heart disease cancer not quite as many 602 350 17.8 even because it's just been recent it was covered at 10 and then a number of other things but here's what is not even in the list you guys i want you to leave that up there if you don't mind abortions in the united states that same year 890 000. that's 27 of the total but they don't even list those lives as lives in other words our culture devalues and god says i don't want you to be like this guy that was outside of kavanaugh's admitted he came there to kill him came with weapons to break in tools and and he admitted he was that you all heard that about that this morning in the news right right now um he is upset about the leak that the the roe versus wade is going to be overturned and he was upset about the gun laws and yuvaldi and these children dying and so he was going to go kill kavanaugh now is it just me or is there something don't make sense about that let's see i'm really upset about children dying so i'm going to go kill a guy who might be part of making a decision to protect the unborn in the womb because i don't agree with it because i'm from california simi valley a man needs help um i mean i think he", "was suicidal as well you should we should pray for my my point is this though that our culture does not value it doesn't even count those that god counts as human beings in their in their numbers and god says i don't want you to be like the world in their attitude towards blood then he goes on in our text and he talks about take a look in verse 26 he says nor shall you practice sooth saying now sooth saying is fortune predicting the future not so much prophecy biblical prophecy but the idea of going to somebody who's in a cult uh in practice um so this would include every form of the occult part playing with it messing around with the ouija boards reading your horoscope and seeing any value in that oh i just do it for fun well don't you know i don't think that's a very good idea you know it's kind of when it comes to the occult when when god's people worshipped false when they went into um witches to have their you know fortune told or when they would try to contact the dead um to seek even god by the way that is that is saul's sin in the old testament he's trying to get a hold of god and so he's gonna he's gonna go talk to a witch to try to talk to samuel it's very interesting when when people are trying to have a spiritual experience but they're consulting the dead and they're not really in right relationship to god it is infidelity to god so don't think that you're just playing with a nothing i just want to read my horoscope because you know i'm a sagittarius and i am going to like that be careful do you know that there are um 70 million americans who daily check the horoscope to see what it says and some of those americans are in this and i'm just telling you that's not that you should be doing god says i want my people to have nothing to do with that you don't go to a palm reader you don't go and read tarot cards those are all off limits for believers god says shouldn't the people consult their god why would you consult the dead on behalf of the living it doesn't make sense to god and he says off limits don't have be different than and by the way if you say well god doesn't speak to me so i'm going to go talk to this person who talks to the dead you know what when god stops", "talking to you that's a wake-up call god stopped talking to saul because of but instead of getting right with god he just goes well i'm just going to find somebody else who will connect me in with the spirit realm don't do that it's real but it's real bad and then look at verse 27 and verse 28 you shall not round off the side growth of your heads he said what's that well those are your those your mutton chops there your nor harm the edges of your beard say i'm not supposed to trim my beard you shall not make any cuts in your body for the dead nor make any tattoo marks on yourselves i am the lord he said no here it is i've always wondered where the bible says we can't have tattoos so now i can judge everybody that i see that has one great verse i will memorize this one slow your roll deuteronomy 14 and verse is a corresponding verse to this here's what god said you are the sons of the lord your god you shall not cut nor shave your forehead for the sake of the dead you need to realize that the ancient practices of the pagans was many times to cut themselves and to tattoo themselves it's not the tattoos that you see nowadays at least most of them these were tattoos for not in memory of somebody who had died like sometimes you see a person with that tattoo but it was a form of worship and it was to worship those gods and to be in connection with the dead and god says don't do it so whether it was the cutting of the hair the shaving of their heads by the way elijah's up on mount carmel remember that the prophets of baal are chanting trying to get a hold of this false god well guess what you can call all day but if there's nobody you know lights are on and nobody's home so there's no answer but what do they start doing they start cutting themselves trying to get his attention this is part of the ancient practice god's basically saying this look i don't want you my people whose god is alive to act like those people who the their god is dead they're trying to contact the dead we are to relate differently to the dead than the world does let's put it that way jot down first thessalonians 4 and verse 13. here's what paul says brethren we don't want you to be uninformed about those who are asleep in others christians who have died you that", "you may not grieve as the rest who have no hope when it comes to dealing with those that we've lost uh who've died before us as believers we don't act the same way the world acts we don't need to try to get a hold of our dead relatives because we're going to see them soon enough remember christians never say goodbye for the last time so worldliness a lot of times is imitating the world god says i don't want you to be like that don't do that don't have that don't have that mindset remember what peter did when he wanted to fit in after jesus was arrested in the court yard of caiaphas remember he it was cold and he was warming himself by a fire and someone i recognize you you're one of them and he's like looking around like you're talking about me yeah i didn't even talk like those hit galileans you know not me yeah i think i saw obj and he denies the lord three times right and finally what does he do to kind of cement the fact that he's not one of the followers of jesus well he takes an oath but he swears and i think there are some christians who so desperately want to fit in with their non-christian people they work with and their friends they talk like the unbelievers talk not normally not at home not here but when they're with the world you kind of have to fit in be careful you'll regret it just as much as in verse 29 is an interesting statement do not profane your daughter by making her a harlot so that the land will not fall to harlotry and the land become full of lewdness and you say to yourself what father would do that make his daughter a harlot i don't know but may i suggest the application for some might be don't let your daughter dress like a harlot the lord wants us as parents to be careful verse 30 says you shall keep my sabbaths and revere my sanctuary remember what clint eastwood said in make my day make my day uh the la the lord would say to his people honor my day in this case the sabbath i want you to honor my day there's a special day the rest of the world doesn't celebrate it they don't take off though well believe me everybody else didn't have a weekend and the jews just had one day everybody else worked seven days a week only the jews didn't work and they did it in faith god i hope you're gonna", "provide for us because we're working less than the rest of our neighbors who think we're nuts but god says you trust me you take a day off you rest and you honor me and i want you to honor my house you will revere my sanctuary that's where i meet with you by the way in the bible our bodies are the temple of the living god shot it down first corinthians 3 17 listen to what god says about that if any man destroys the temple of god god will destroy him for the temple of god is holy and that is what you now the world you know sees going to church as a at worst you know or at best i should say i got to ah i guess we'll go off so your whole family's going and there is a brunch okay i'll go you know it's a got to a spirit-filled believer she's going to church as a get to i i know what it's like i grew up going forced to go to church every sunday we didn't even have wednesday nights i mean but there was nobody going on wednesday nights but on sunday morning i did not want to go and as a child i was so glad my parents would talk to these people all these old people you know in their 40s and 30s and stuff and they would they would i was so glad when mom and dad said okay time to go get the cars like oh thank you maybe you feel that way but here's what here's what david said in psalm 122 verse 1. i was glad when they said to me let us go into the house of the lord not when this let's go home from the house of the lord i was glad when they said let's go there and that's the way it ought to be in you shall rise up before the grey-headed that means no grecian formula uh and honor the aged and you shall revere your god i am the lord now our culture obviously elevates and exalts the rich and the famous uh you know you don't have tv shows on the poor and but the rich and the famous and the young and the beautiful and that's just the way the flesh is it's always going to be that way but god says revere now that does not come naturally to any in the ancient world there was more of a concern about the egypt but even back then there was a problem i think it's mark twain who said it's", "too bad that youth is wasted on the but the fact is sometimes we struggle with this same issue even in our day of really giving any respect to where it's due now i want you to jot down first peter 5 and verse 5. he says you younger men likewise be to your elders and all of you clothe yourselves with humility toward one another god's approach to the proud and he gives grace to the humble so it's not just a one-way thing but there are two errors one is a younger generation or thinking that a younger generation has nothing to teach us because we're so mature and we've been around the block that's a big problem by the way in our culture too which is thinking the young people there you know whatever and and uh they need to pay their dues they can't teach me anything that's that's and i think that some of us need to listen to a younger generation more i know for me the lord has used a younger generation to change me and i'm so grateful for the young men and women of our church and particularly the young pastors that i gather with them every week some of you don't know this i gather with a group every week for about two and a half hours on tuesdays it's a creative team that i listen to now they listen to me and yes i their employer and you know they like when they shake their heads because i say something but the fact is i'm listening to what god is saying to because there have eyes to see our generation in a way that is a little different than i can see it we need to listen and not just think everybody else should listen to us but the other mistake and this is very common is for a younger generation to think an older generation is completely clueless it's very very common remember the story now rehoboam is the son of solomon without getting into the texans in first kings 12 but remember after solomon dies and rehoboam becomes king he has these people who come to him and they say please lower the taxes i mean this has been too hard during your dad's life and so he goes to his father's counselors who are older and he's what do you guys think i should do and he said oh man you should listen to them if you'll just be easy on them they'll they'll serve you for the rest of their life it's okay i'll think about", "it and he goes and he says he gets his buddies together that were his age young guys because what do you guys think i man you tell him your dad your dad was like your little finger but you know you you're the macho guy and you thought your dad was bad wait till you get all you you pack some more you put them in their place ah you got to show them who's boss yeah that's what he does he goes with the young guys and the entire kingdom rebels against him and he loses the kingdom because all he was doing was listening to people his age that he said things that were like what he wanted to hear we need to be careful that we think somehow older people are clueless maybe we are in some things but there's we people have lived life quickly we'll fill in the blanks so i don't do two weeks in a row where i'm not finishing treat strangers right remembering what it's like that's verses 33 and 34. number three decide justice is always your baseline that's where you start that's always the first priority uh commandment even in micah 6 8 he has shown me what is good and what the lord requires to be but to do justly jesus said that the neglected the the pharisees neglected the weightier matters of the law which were justice and then finally fourthly don't substitute learning truth for living truth in verse 37. let's have the to that last one james puts it this way doers of the word and not hearers who the idea is we can deceive ourselves we have started reading the bible we love the word we come to bible studies and i commend you for that i'm thrilled that you're here who would i talk to i'd be talking to myself um but the mistake that bible-believing christians even spirit-filled christians can make is making the bible an end in itself i'm learning it i'm reading it i'm studying it i'm memorizing it i love great but what's it doing in your life we delude or deceive ourselves by getting excited about the bible but it never changes our life it was dl moody who said every bible back then of course bible covers were all leather but he said every bible wrapped in shoe leather in other words it should be your life how you walk how you live the bible is being lived out by us and this is the principle we want to be a people that are saying well i'm listening i'm learning i'm discovering what the word", "but now lord help me do something with let's all stand his name is joseph you know him in the new testament he's the stepfather of jesus you know how many times god spoke to joseph that we know of god spoke to him do you know what god records that joseph said to the lord god told him to do things three times in dreams the bible just says he woke up and he did it that's the way it needs to be that's what i call the the nike faith just do and joseph was exactly that i want to be more like that let's sing and we'll go for the souls of god for the love of jesus when you hear the word holy do you say i know i'm not sinless and i know i'm not perfect but i do want to see myself and used for your glory and if you want that then you're in line with what god wants and if you ask anything according to his will the bible says you'll have it maybe there's an area of your life we've talked about it tonight something and you feel like i need to deal with that i need to get that out of my life i need dedicate my life or consecrate my life come to the prayer room we have some folks that want to pray with you tonight about any area of your life maybe it's your marriage or your family or your work or your attitudes say lord i want to dedicate that i want you to have it all and god wants to start a new work in your life and then the last thing i want to say is this ladies i didn't mention it earlier but our women's retreat is coming there's of workshops at the retreat once they're full they're full so we really want you do that on the app when becky's here which he is tonight you can ask her about him but we want and again i'll encourage husbands encourage your wives to be a part of because there's this thing that happens once a year right here it's on our campus and we want her to we want your wife to be in folded and in fellowship with other women so take advantage of it", "to his love for us our love for him is a response to his love for us look at verse 15 how beautiful are you my darling this is the bridegroom talking now this is Jesus if you will how beautiful are you my darling how beautiful you are your eyes are like does and then she responds how hand some you are my beloved and so pleasant indeed our couches luxuriant the beams of our houses our Cedars our rafters are cypresses wasn't principles if you want a johnny mount she sees herself as black that's how she started but he simply sees her as beautiful very interesting she sees herself in her natural condition as blackened he sees her as beautiful you know it's interesting the King only has good things to say about her somebody said when you're in love with somebody you only see the good you know you only can see something to commend them and end to encourage them and the same is absolutely true that we look at ourselves and if we're honest we say yuck I don't like what I see at all you know I'm not just talking physical you know we include that too but certainly spiritually we go man i'm i'm the chief center paul said he doesn't say I used to be either by the way he said he was still did you know that but Jesus describes the bride as the pearl of great price for which he wins sold all that's before he died before we were changed he saw the bride as the pearl of great price later on in this book will have that phrase I am my beloved's and his desire is for me Wow do you really believe the Lord likes you wants to date you wants to hang out with you wants to spend time with you that he'd rather be with you than hanging out with the Angels do you really believe it he does it's interesting when he's writing Paul is writing to the Ephesians he's praying for them that their eyes would be I been opened and he says I want you to know what is the glory of your inheritance or he doesn't say I'm sorry he says I want you to know what is the glory of his inheritance in you you'd expect him to want you to know what your inheritance is in heaven or what you have in the Lord he says no I want you to know what his inheritance is in you your God's inheritance anybody ever inherited anything in this room good for you some", "of us you know I got some fake pearls once I don't know why anybody left me those but like I want to give him the bob anyway but anyway I never even I didn't even game away because they just weren't worth anything but um but we're not some cheap inheritance for Jesus so how do we get there how do we get back put this down for your right notes meditate more on his love for you his great love for you but you got to see in our text and it happens right in verses 15 through 17 is there is a response he starts out how beautiful you are my darling how beautiful you are your eyes are like doves and suddenly we start to see her respond to it the Bible says we love because what yeah he first loved us now listen it's great to talk about loving Jesus I think it's wonderful if you can say i love the Lord and it's important that you can honestly realize you do and you're too when's the last time you said I love you jesus if you haven't said that in a while I encourage you to start saying it again but focusing on how much you love Jesus can be dangerous because it's probably going than flowing sometimes someone said thinking about our love for the Lord is a more dangerous thing to think about than his love for us that's really really true there are two foot races in the Bible that come to mind in the Old Testament there's one and there's one on the New Testament in the Old Testament it's a couple of guys erasing who are delivering a message concerning a battle and one is commanded to go and run and tell David and his a messenger his name and I'll have a cushy job but his name was pushy or kushai and he runs he's commanded to go tell David that Absalom has been killed but after he starts to run a he muhas asks permission to because I want to run I want to go till David anahim hoss runs but he knows is of a different kind of a personality toward David and he maha's loves David and you know what ahima 'has outruns cushy and gets the David first pushy just running cuz it's his job hey Maha's is running cuz of a passion he wants to be the one that breaks the news about Absalom to David he won't he loves David interesting in the New Testament women come and say the grave is empty Peter and John member are told Easter Sunday", "morning and they run they run it's a race who gets there first who John Peter comes in second dead last there's only two very interesting peter has convinced himself before Jesus goes to the cross that he uniquely loved him I love you so much all these guys might deny you I would never deny you I love you all die for you and so Jesus has to ask him after the resurrection Peter do you really love me with sacrificial agape love well I kind of love you like a friend remember Peter makes all the boasts but John describes himself in his gospel as the one whom Jesus loved interesting you focus on how much you love the Lord and you're gonna have the me out this Christian life you focus instead on how much he loves you and you'll find the power to live for him you know the little book of Jude I mentioned it on Sunday because of the message he decided to write but in that book it's very interesting when he's talking about falling away from Lord he doesn't say keep yourself loving God you know what he says keep yourself in the love of God keep yourself in the place where you keep remembering that's why Jesus you know he said one command even say remember you've sinned he said remember me that's all remember me but it's so easy to get our eyes are the wrong things Philip bliss wrote a number of Christian songs back on the time of deal moody that they would sing up these evangelistic services and he wrote one that you may have heard I know we were still singing in the 70s there is a name I love to hear I love to sing it's worth it sounds like music in my ears right you know that song oh how I love Jesus oh how I love Jesus oh how I love Jesus because He first loved me and it was a very popular song during the 1850s and 60s when deal Moody was preaching how old that saugus lasted quite a while but one time as he was hearing the crowd sing that song it bothered him that it seemed like they were always singing about their love for Jesus which was ok he said but he felt like that wasn't where the focus ought to be so he wrote another him one that you may not know as well probably not as popular as the one that talks about how much I love Jesus but in this second song it says this I am so glad that my father in heaven", "tells of his love in the book he has given wonderful things in the Bible I see but this is the greatest that Jesus loves me jesus loves me jesus loves me jesus loves even me oh that needs to be our focus well drop this down hear him speak to you and let him hear from you because instead of just talking about the Lord there starts to be communication back between the two of them in verses 15 and 16 now the bride and the groom aren't just praising him to other people which is a part of loving somebody when you love something you talk to other people but now the focus is there really starting to talk talk directly to each other yeah it's good to come to church and praise the Lord it's part of what work to do we need to be around each other we need to be in the word we need to be taught we need fellowship for sure but we need to go beyond publicly praising the Lord and go to a deeper level of personally communicating to him telling him yourself I love you and here's why Jesus I thank you we need to listen to him we need to speak to him and then if you want to jot down he sees in you what you can't see in yourself it's interesting to me in verse 15 he says your eyes are like what doves now think about it you know in the ancient world they didn't have mirrors like you and I have the beers were not very good that's why Paul would say in first Corinthians 13 though now we see through a mirror dimly because the mirrors weren't like perfect they were poor reflections so you didn't get to really see yourself other people could see you you know if I have something on my I you might see it I can't see it for talking and so what's interesting to me is he sees her eyes and comments on them but that would be something she Nessus what necessarily see she's seeing herself through his eyes now what I love about the fact is that the bridegroom is seeing the bride with having eyes of a dove and who is the Dove type and a symbol of in the Bible the Holy Spirit remember the Spirit of God descended upon Jesus at his baptism in the form of a dove I thought John the Baptist knew this is the one all through the Bible the picture of the character you know the Bible says be wise as serpents but innocent as does we have", "this beautiful picture of the bride having eyes of a dove and it's coming from the bridegroom she's not seeing that herself you know one of the fruit of the Holy Spirit is meekness let me ask you what does it mean to be meek when you hear that word we don't use that term too much you know but what does it mean to be meek let me give us a yeah controlled strength yes one of the meanings of this word proud taste so just weak is that of power under control so a stallion that has been a wild stallion that's been broken and domesticated and now it's using its power under the control of somebody else what else meek if someone's meek let me think of humble jesus said this in Matthew 11 he said if anyone is where he come to me and i'll give you rest take my yoke upon you and learn of me for I am gentle and the word in greek is the same word proud taste i am meek and lowly of heart those are parallel words so its power under control but it's that sense of humility the gods spirit she has eyes of a dove part of that character is to become me you know i love what Chuck Smith used to say you say you say you don't have known Greek to understand the word meek he said it works perfectly in English meek is me it is just perfect you know is that not focusing on your self I think of Moses talk about Nazi and when your meek you probably won't know your meek think about Moses he goes up and he's in the presence of God the Bible says he's the meekest man on earth and the Bible says his faith his face glowed but it doesn't say he came down going here to check out my face he hadn't seen his face it wasn't like it was glowing and he could see it everybody else could see it but he couldn't see it I think of Gideon remember Gideon in judges chapter 6 the angel of the Lord appears to Gideon remember the Midianites have enslaved the children of Israel and God's gonna raise that this is Gideon's call this is when he first gets called it in the ministry and he's not thinking he should you know start a revival or anything else he's just trying to live out his life without making too much of a problem for the enemy in fact he's hiding he's he's winnowing his wheat in a wine VAT which should speak volumes as", "to his fear he's doing it in a place where you can't really to there's no wind and a wine VAT that's where he's doing it and the angel of the Lord comes and appears to him at this wine VAT and he says these words to Gideon the Lord is with you Oh valiant warrior I know he's not a soldier the Lord is with you Oh valiant warrior and I'm sure Gideon thought where'd you get that and who are you talking to but the Lord could see in him what he could not see in himself can I say one of the cool things is if you spent some time with the Lord you might think he would just point out all your flaws but he wouldn't he would point out all of the characteristics and you that he's already worked into you that he is so excited about he sees the Spirit of God working in you and through you that you either minimize have forgotten or you can't see but the Lord sees and commends is bright for them and then finally put this down praise Him if you're going to jot it down praise him for the rest you find in his house for the rest we find any thoughts / 16 how handsome this is the bright now how handsome you are my beloved and you're so pleasant indeed our couch is luxurious by the way the word luxuriant in Hebrew is the word green so they had a green couch no someone I mean she's talking about the fact that he's a shepherd they're outside it's talking about grass and when it's been the place where we recline is restocking about the fields think about what David says there in Psalm 23 Lord's my shepherd I shall know when he makes me to lie down where pastors you see he get he brings me to a place of rest she's admiring and and thankful for her bridegroom because of the rest that he has brought into her life and then she goes on to describe she goes from the couch to the house she says there in verse 17 the beams of our houses are Cedars and our rafters are Cyprus's no seeders and cypresses speak of obviously expensive this is not cheap veneer this is not the stuff you buy at Home Depot to finish off your wall with cheap wood this is the real stuff the expensive stuff solid wood in other words our house is not something that's shaky or poorly built I want you to jot down some forty six verses one through", "four and it's talking about security here's what the psalmist says God is our refuge and Our Strength a very present help in trouble therefore we will not fear though the earth should change and though the mountains slip into the heart of the sea though its waters roar and foam though the mountains quake at its swelling pride seyla there is a river whose streams make glad the City of God the Holy dwelling places of the Most High so here's here's what she is doing she's saying first of all you bring me a place of refreshment and rest that's what our couches but also I live with you our houses are built of solid expensive quality wood now what's interesting is she begins this chapter that looked back in chapter 1 verse 5 she says I am black but lovely Oh daughters of Jerusalem like the tents of Kedar when she starts to describe herself initially she's saying I'm black not only in the color but this idea of the tent I'm she's affiliated that with a solid structure but something that can be blown over by the winds you know but now that she's in relationship with him she's in this place of total security I love the song that we sing sometimes based on what Paul wrote in Philippians that he'll began a good work in you will complete it to the day of Jesus and here's what some of the lines say if the struggle you're facing a slow replacing your hope with despair or if the process is long and you're losing your song in the night you can be sure that the Lord has his hand on you safe and secure he will never abandon you you are his treasure and he finds his pleasure in you I love that this bride has come to be aware that her bridegroom is bringing her to a place of rest in her life that she did not know before comfort but also security as she is now in his house and by the way I love the fact that she says our house but remember what Jesus said in John 14 I go to prepare a place for you in my father's house are many rooms film or not so I would have told you but I go to prepare a place for you that where I am what you may be also when you get married whatever you married into becomes common property and I've often said this you know when when my pastor declared Becky my wife and me her husband though we didn't exchange anything right there other than the", "Rings there was a lot more that was going on legally suddenly everything that I had became hers everything my okay my 72 Nova but I did we I had an apartment we made keys for her for me Keith the car she needed will have one car so she didn't want to ride my skateboard I didn't have a skateboard I'm kidding but everything I had was her do you know what happens not just some day in heaven well right now everything see the psalmist says he owns the cattle on a Thousand Hills the wealth of every mine the old him says it too he owns the rivers and the Roxanne drilled the Sun and the moon that shine wonderful richest more than tone can tell he's my father they're mine as well whether you use the analogy of father son or husband wife everything that's his is yours his house listen I think a lot of Christians make this mistake of thinking well I'm a Christian so I get to go to heaven they almost picture is like Disneyland you know holiest place on earth or whatever i'm going to go to the New Jerusalem and i'm gonna show my season pass or something i'm gonna get in because I you know I have stamp of Jesus on my hand and like you're gonna be a guest in the kingdom get to go on every ride can I tell you something you're not a guest you're not a visitor you're the bride of the bridegroom you own the place do you understand I don't think we do I don't think it'll really dawn on us till we get there we just be content to be in the choir see some of us have never been asked to be in the choir whole life some of you have been good for you remember in 4th grade when the music teacher had all the kids go over to the multi-purpose room and she sang she played a few notes on the piano she just asked us to sing god bless america whatever was and she only needed just a you just saying a couple lines for her to know whether you were going to be in the school choir me and two other kids were the only ones the entire semester who played games while everybody else sang in the school choir I'm not healed no I'm just getting out of here fact is we're not going to just get to be in the choir in heaven that would be wonderful that'll be great but God has so much more for you listen here's what I want", "to do we're going to close you're gonna going to come forward so you can wake up and we're going to sing one last song but or a couple songs we have enough time come on up forward and we'll finish here's what I want you to do tonight I want you just to be honest about how things are between you and the Lord I started tonight by saying laskin question I said do you love the Lord now listen that's kind of a tricky question say what do you mean well when Jesus asked Peter do you love me clearly there was some issues that had to be resolved because Peter answers but what does Jesus say as soon as Peter says yes he asked some second time now if I said you Randy do you love me I'd be a strange question but we're best friends and you answered me but I asked you again you might feel like I just answered you Bob what do they say in court asked and answered object three times jesus asked the exact same question and so can I tell you something it's easier for you to say I'm good there Bob I'm fine I love the Lord but what if he keeps asking you on your way home tonight I want you to allow the Lord to ask you that question he's not asking you to make you feel bad he's not but he doesn't want you just to say everything's cool lorde see in heaven we're good thank you for dying for me because he's passionate about you can I ask it another way he ever been in love with somebody who wasn't in love with then I can tell you if you've ever had that experience and some of you go oh yes I've known that some are going I know that right now maybe you have a deep love for one of your children who don't want you in their life maybe you've loved a spouse who stopped loving you but I can tell you this much if you love somebody with your whole heart who doesn't love you back then that's a consuming passion for you and that's the way the Lord feels about every one of us here I want you back when i tell you something nobody else on this planet has more of a right to your heart and your affection than Jesus he has a right to it and can I say something else until you're back in love with him you're gonna find this life to be oh so less than it was designed to be because you", "don't you're not living for the one person who is worthy of your affection you're not worthy of it sorry to say it you'll never be fulfilled by living for yourself or anybody else so maybe we just need to save the Nightlord i'm not sure where I stand with you or we need to say I'm not where I want to be not we're not where you are toward me so Lord stir me a fresh he's by the way he wrote a prescription of how to get back there I'll give you that little thing I promise he said to that church at Ephesus remember from where you have fallen that was number one in other words admit that you're not where he used to be for some of us that's where we're going to start to he said repent which means to change your mind and then thirdly he said do the deed you did it first what was it like when you used to be in love well I used to talk to in the morning is to talk to him on the way to work I used to sing songs to him start doing it I think they still have music on the radio and cds and stuff on your phone go download a love song and enjoy it tomorrow morning rita's word tomorrow or tonight talked them before you go to I'm ready to start that adventure afresh let's sing together No who died later you know when you when you're out of gas that can be scary if you don't know where to get gas Becky and I were coming through Nevada never do this on a motorcycle I think it's Highway 93 nobody who rides a motorcycle designed that few of gas stations between each other anyway it's a long story that I don't want to tell you but it was a question whether we were going to just become skeletons in the middle of the desert because there was 110 degrees out and just nothing but when you're at when you're when you're when you're empty you just need to know where to go to get filled that sounds pretty simple done it you just need to know where to go to get filled jesus said if anyone is thirsty let him come to me and drink he's not going to shame you cuz you're thirsty is gonna bless you because you're willing to admit it Yusei but Bob I'm really dry I'm cold spiritually I'm dry spiritually okay let me ask you something what do you think the best kindling in the world", "is stuff that's really dry I don't care how dry you are God says he is a consuming fire you just get yourself close to him and you will catch don't sit there and bemoaned and your dry and that your MD about really good it who cares how you got here question the how long you want to stay there seek the Lord tell him say God I'm dry I'm a pathetic I couldn't cause what Bob said didn't touch me at all or your word didn't minister to me tonight but have a sense maybe it's not your word Lord it's my heart it's hard God says I'll give you a new heart I'll take away your heart of stone i'll give you a heart of flesh that's beating for me ask him he wants and more than you do let me pray for us father I do ask that as we are looking into the mirror of two people that are passionately in love with each other and Lord as we see what we perhaps once were or what we've never been but we want to be as we look into the Song of Solomon and see a bridegroom who is passionately in love with and enjoying his bride praising his bride and a bride who can't stop talking about her bridegroom Lord would you make us as we it's not just as we study it but as we pursue you as we ask you to help us pursue you as we respond to your loved with a love and kind would you make us go after you in the wilderness that we're in a fresh Lord to not be afraid when anybody thinks about us but to be so in love with you we can't stop telling people about you but help us to just start by telling you we're sorry Lorne for growing cold we're sorry for getting busy we're sorry for being focused on ourself but Jesus thank you that you don't want to waste our time groveling in guilt you want to pour on us grace than a crown of beauty so forgive us draws near to yourself and set us on fire and fresh for we ask it in Jesus name Amen god bless you", "he just was gone aaron said to them no you shouldn't do that let's pray for him no he didn't say it aaron said to them tear off the gold rings which are in the ears of your wives that must have felt good your sons and your daughters and bring them to me then all the people tore off the gold rings which were in their ears and brought them to aaron he took this from their hand and he fashioned it with a graving tool and he made it into a molten calf and they said this is your god o israel who brought you up out of the land of egypt now when aaron saw this he built an altar before it and aaron made a proclamation and said tomorrow shall be a great feast to yahweh verse six so the next day they rose early they offered burnt offerings and brought peace offerings and the people sat down to eat and to drink and they rose up to play and that's not talking about volleyball let's pray father your people who you've just saved out of egypt by a mighty hand by ten your people who went through the red sea on dry ground your people who saw the pillar of cloud by day and the pillar of fire by night and they couldn't have missed your presence on sinai right frightening to them they know that you're there and yet so quickly after they have been saved they are going to go right into idolatry lord how patient you are to not have destroyed them right then we pray lord you would give us insight into you and to us in our relationship with you and the way that you are gentle and kind to correct us when we go off track lord some of us are here tonight because you started bringing circumstances into our life to do just some of us maybe aren't aware that you're about to do something to get our attention but lord you love us enough that you won't let us go off into sin and keep going so teach us about yourself tonight in jesus name i pray amen you can be seated well i've entitled the chapter really god's doing that a lot in the old testament but he's doing a lot in your life as well you know when you become a christian while you're forgiven and your spirit is made alive and as far as god is concerned you are holy you are set apart you are sanctified in his eyes yet day to day we need to grow we need to", "become more like the lord and this process of sanctification is is slow it'll take from this day or the day you receive christ to the day you go to heaven and that's when he'll do the heavy lifting and he'll give you a new body and he'll make you completely like christ but the lord is committed to saving us not just at the moment we receive christ and believe but throughout our life to help us because we tend to struggle with the flesh the world and the devil and we fall into sin and we're immature just like children growing up have to learn things a lot of times you kind of have to learn the hard way and the children of israel are no different but there's a lot of lessons for us in this in this text tonight so i want you to fill in the blanks if you're doing so please do put in the word impatience we see in the first six verses the danger of impatience um have you noticed that god doesn't seem to ever be in a hurry when you are like you would like to get him to do something and he many times doesn't move anywhere near at the rate that you'd like him to um we see the effect of impatience many times in scripture i think of abram who want to have a baby and god promises you're going to have one and then he just doesn't give him one for a long david is anointed as you know by samuel as a young boy he's going to be king it just doesn't happen real quick joseph has some cool dreams that he goes and shares with everybody about how they're going to bow down to him because who wouldn't share that with the people that are going to bow down to you and but that doesn't happen overnight either and the fact is many times god will place desires in our heart he'll make commitments to us there are promises that he makes but that doesn't mean he's going to do it anytime like what we thought he should or would many times we expect god to act uh you know lazarus's sisters mary and martha said the one whom you love is sick come heal him you've healed up total strangers certainly you'll heal lazarus you bit in our home and they expected him to show up jesus did show up for the right and they were thinking like where well he's right on time but that's our problem from our perspective god's late he's never late and so impatience can", "get us in trouble so abram and sarah as we have studied decided well let's help give us a child remember the whole story of ishmael and hagar and so they get ahead of the lord and it's really easy to do probably the most common citation i wrote as a cop anybody want to guess what it was 22 350. that's the vehicle code on safe speed and you know what i think that's quite often in the kingdom of god true we want to see god's will worked out we think we know what it is or how it should work out so we're going to help and we get ahead of the lord the bible says he who believes in him the stone that is who it's a a reference a prophecy of christ it says he who trusts in him he believes in him will not make haste and we have that expression that we've all heard growing up haste makes yeah it's going to be a problem think about saul king saul he's told by samuel who's god's man hey i'm going to show up on this date we're for the king to offer up sacrifices that's something samuel the priest was going to do he's a priest judge and you know saul's worried about keeping the people in alignment with him the army they're about to fight the philistines it's a kind of a tenuous situation and then samuel just doesn't show up on time and the people of israel are running away from king saul and the philistines and and uh by the way he reminds samuel who does finally show up you didn't show up on time like you said and he gives him all these reasons why he went ahead he had to offer the and you know what samuel representing the lord says shouldn't have done that that'll cost you the kingdom it was you had no right to do that your impatience can cost you far more than you can ever believe in here because moses went up and he didn't come down he never said i'll be down in 40 days he just was up with the lord you can trust somebody when they're with the lord in fact is somebody spending extra time with lord i would suggest you really let them do that but anyway moses is up on their behalf representing them before god and the mountain's on fire and there's an earthquake happening and it's scary and they just think well he probably just got like got consumed up there and he probably just got he said something wrong and he's dead now we're", "gonna stay here forever at mount sinai i don't think so we're going to the promised land and so they come to number two uh aaron who tries harder in our text to be number one he doesn't do a very good job but put this down beware temptation when the savior delays his coming down moses is the savior he's not jesus but he's a type of christ in that god uses him many times to reflect christ but he is delaying up there and the people start to freak out that they've been left behind i guess that god's forgotten about them and you might say they well they have a cow literally here by the way this idea of making a molten calf shouldn't be too hard for us to understand and we studied many of them when we studied exodus but one of the chief deities of the egyptians was apis this this calf they were very aware of calf worship that was a part of the egyptian culture they had all been brought up in egypt that's what they that's when they think of gods that's the gods of the world by the way even the earrings that'll be used to make this golden calf where did they get they got those from the egyptians when they left remember they spoiled the egyptians and they were given this jewelry and so they use it or aaron does to have this this idol made it's interesting they basically are saying the god that we thought was going to lead us doesn't seem to be too concerned about our needs he's just left us here so what we really need is we need to make a god that will fit in with our we're going to call it yahweh but we're going to make a god and we're going to get moving on this trip again because that other god doesn't seem to be too interested in us jot down second timothy 4 verses 2 and 3. paul says to timothy preach the word be ready or urgent in season and out of season reprove rebuke and exhort with great patience and instruction for the time has come the time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine but wanting to have their ears tickled or they will accumulate for themselves teachers in accordance with their own desires paul giving a prophecy of the end days that there will be an appetite for an appearance of godliness we want teachers we want people to teach us about god but we want them to teach us what we want to hear what does the old", "song say tell me something good tell me about me tell me how much god loves me tell me how many will prosper me and so we'll find teachers yes we're still christians oh yes we still study the bible so to speak but we want you to tell us things that make us feel good that entertain us you know there's a lot of preaching nowadays but i call it longhorn sermons you know what that is a longhorn sermon that's a point here and a point here and a lot of bowl in between oh there's there's plenty of those going jot down luke 12 verses 45 and 46. here's what jesus said concerning his it's very interesting because we talk about when's he going to come back it's been 2000 years and my goodness what's jesus said this if that slave says in my master will be a long time in coming and he begins to beat the slaves both men and women and he begins to eat and drink and get drunk well the master of that slave will come on a day when he does not expect in an hour he does not know and we'll cut him in pieces and assign him a place with the unbelievers very interesting the lord basically says for that person who claims to be a believer but is saying ah my master delays his return it's a long time from now and i sometimes hear crazy well you never know it's been a lot longer than they used to think it could be a thousand a million i have no idea when it's gonna be you don't either you don't know it's not gonna be tonight neither do i the bible's really clear we need to be ready at all times but when we say oh it's not anytime soon always counterproductive to living in the way that we should i like to say and i don't have ever thought about this but in a sense every is to be like mary the mother of jesus you say what do you mean well there's a point in her life where she is engaged now that's never ideal but in this case it was the will of god she was engaged to joseph and she was expecting we are to be engaged occupied until he comes and we are to be expecting we are to be expecting his return simultaneously lord i'm engaged in the mission that you've called me to but i'm expecting you to come at any time and interrupt it and i live with both of those priorities jot down first", "john 3 verses 2 and 3. first john 3 beloved now we are the children of god it hasn't yet appeared what we shall be but we know that when jesus appears we'll be like him because we'll see him just as he is then it says this and everyone who has this hope what hope of seeing jesus when he returns everyone who has this hope fixed on him what do they do well they purify themselves just as he is pure in other words there's an incredible importance not just do you pre-post mid-trib where do you stand theologically oh no there's an effect if you believe jesus is coming at any time it changes it should change the way you live if it doesn't you don't believe in it correctly he who has this hope of christ coming anytime and being changed it changes the way you live day to day what do the bridesmaids do in the parable of the ten virgins when they hear the bridegroom's about to the cry comes at midnight behold the wiser foolish they were all asleep by the way that's a word to the wise they were all asleep even the true believers who were really waiting for him to come the others we know without oil but very interesting to me what did they do well they all arose and they trimmed their lamps now we don't use that term too much they made sure the oil was there the wick was on and this match was lit it was on fire and it was giving light keep your loins girded and your lamps burning jesus said in other words you're ready for him to come because you're living as a witness for and put this down if you would idolatry often results in immorality did you notice in verse 6 take a look at the text again verse 6 the next day they rose early and here they're involved in worship this is religious exercise burnt offerings which is supposed to be a picture of total consecration peace offerings which is a picture of fellowshipping with the lord and the people though in the midst of that sit down to eat and to drink and they rose up to play here's what it says in romans 1 man moves away from god the very first step in moving away from god you remember what it was they refused to acknowledge though they know there's a god they don't just leave him out you know it doesn't you don't have to be an agnostic or an atheist to be godless you can be a born-again christian and be", "godless you say what do you mean just leave god out of your plans of your thinking of your just don't talk to just you i've got my fire insurance i'm going to heaven that's godlessness it's living like the world lives the fool has said in his heart there's no god the christian fool just acts like but in romans 1 it begins the downward spiral begins with refusing to give god honoring him as god or giving thanks you just don't say thank you for your food you don't say you don't really you're not thankful or even if you are you don't say thank you to god it's where it begins and this is the way of the world there is no acknowledgement of god except using him as a curse word there's no thanking god for anything but as people move away from god in romans 1 the bible says he gives them to do that which is unseemly to do those things that are impure sexual sin is what follows moving god out of the place of being god idolatry is always associated in the bible with immorality in fact all the pagan rituals involve sexual immorality that's why when you read about corinth they had all these temple prostitutes you'd go up there to worship the pagan gods and you'd have sex they were connected and you might think that doesn't seem to mix well well it if you stop worshiping the true god you see you don't have to submit to his his what he teaches about those things when you move god let me put it a different way if there's sexual sin in your life then you've got a problem with putting god number one in your life it's as simple as that always realize those two go together sexual sin and putting god less than where he needs to be those two are connected in scripture put this down when tempted to give up on people see god is testing you now look at verse 7 through 14. then the lord spoke to moses he god knows what's going on he doesn't know it yet he's about to interrupt this quiet time with this important message go down moses you've heard that go down at once for your people whom you brought up from the land of egypt well they've they've quickly turned aside from the way which i commanded them they've made for themselves a molten and they've worshipped it sacrificed to it they said this is your god o israel who brought you out of the land of egypt the lord said to moses i have seen this", "and behold they are stiff-necked king james as obstinate people now then let me alone that my anger may burn against them that i may destroy them and i will make you a great nation verse 11 then moses entreated he prays and he says oh lord why does your anger burn against your people whom you have brought up out of the land of egypt with great power and a mighty hand why should the egyptians speak saying with evil he referring to the lord brought them out to kill them in the mountains and to destroy them from the face of the earth turn from your burning anger he says to the lord change your mind about doing harm to your people and then moses says this lord remember abraham and isaac and israel your servants to whom you swore by yourself and said to them i will multiply the seed as the stars of the heavens and all this land of which i have spoken i will give to your descendants and they shall inherit it forever so the lord did what changed his mind that'll mess with your changed his mind about the harm which he said he would do to his people well there's some lessons for us here for sure first of all put this down don't write off god's people who are in maybe you have a son or a daughter maybe you have a christian friend who used to walk with the lord and they don't anymore they are backslidden and they know it and it so angers you to see the way they're dishonoring god it's very interesting in the text in verse 7 the lord says to moses these are your that you brought up moses you know um i don't know if you've ever had somebody do that um your wife ever say do you know what your son did it's like did i adopt what wait a minute i didn't come into this marriage with a kid why do you say your son do you remember in the gospel of luke prodigal son takes everything from the father goes out finally repents because he's hungry and he's apparently repenting at least he's coming home i don't know exactly where his heart's at but he he's willing to humble himself he comes back the father meets him there runs after him falls on him he's been waiting for this day you remember the story kill the fatted calf party time for that he was dead he's alive he was lost and we we found him and the older brother who's always been faithful hears them all this commotion", "what's going on at the house oh did you hear your brother is home and your dad said kill that big fat calf for him i should go checking this on myself and he gets to the house and there's to partying and dancing and now that was not immorality kind of dancing here this was celebration of a of a son who's come and somehow the older son is not exactly posting on facebook guess who's home i'm can't stand it dad never killed a cat for me i've always been a i'm a goody three shoes and he's never done anything for me and he brings his father aside and do you know what he calls his brother that son of yours that son of you not my brother that son of yours you know um when somebody does something wrong it's easy to be angry at what they do wrong it's really easy to get angry at them but anger is kind of contagious frankly somebody does something wrong to me i like it when other people are mad it makes me feel like amen so somehow i have a right to get mad the lord tells moses what the people are he tells them he he tells them about and it's clear god is angry at their sin i mean very angry i'm going to wipe them out let's face it god is he's not faking it he's angry justly at their sin and moses has kind of devoted his life lately to getting them out of egypt risking his life and though i mean so he says your people you brought him up this was you in his autobiography called number one billy martin told about hunting in texas with mickey mantle a long time ago mickey had a friend who would let them hunt on his ranch and when they reached the ranch mickey told billy to wait in the car while he checked with his friend mantle's friend quickly gave them permission to hunt on his property but he asked mickey mantle a favor the man had a pet mule in the barn who was going blind and he didn't have the heart to put him out of his misery so he asked mickey would you would you do it would you shoot the mule mickey said he would so when mickey came back to the car where billy was waiting he pretended to be angry he scowled and he slammed the door billy said what's mickey said his friend wouldn't let them hunt on the property i'm so mad at that guy mickey said i'm going i'm going out", "to his barn and oh he hadn't shot a minute i'm going out to his barn and shoot one of his mules so he pretended that he was going to kill one just because he's mad martin protested we can't do that mickey said just watch me so he jumped out of the car with his rifle ran inside the barn and he shot the mule as he was leaving though he heard two other shots he saw that martin had taken out his rifle too what are you doing martin martin yelled back face red with anger we'll show him i just killed two of his that's a true story i'm not it's not a but that's kind of what anger does it incites many times other people to injustices that they're going to deal god is bringing a legitimate uh his wrath toward the sin of his people who are worshiping a false god after he's just saved them and i believe with all of my heart the question really from moses says what are you going to do with going to lose your temper my bible has little uh paragraph headings when the subject changes this is this area is called now we do know later in the book of numbers moses is going to have an anger it's going to cost him his trip to the holy land by the way but here he's not reproved for anger but he had an opportunity to lose it and maybe we would say humanly a reason to blow up or give up on god's people if god's going to give up on him well why it's interesting the lord said leave me leave me alone and i will destroy them and i will replace them with a new nation we'll call call it the mosesites it's going to forget abraham we'll just go with you which might have been tempting for moses but if you want him destroyed moses you just leave me alone may i suggest is right then that god's kind of saying don't leave me alone leave me alone and they i have every right they deserve to be destroyed but god's saying if you don't without saying it it's time to talk to it's time to intercede i don't know if you've noticed it because they tend to be more obscure passages in the gospels where the lord does something and we're told that it appears he's going to do something that he doesn't do i'm going to give a couple to you mark 6 verses 48 through 51 on the sea of galilee the disciples are out in the", "storm it says jesus comes walking on the water and seeing them straining up the oars for the wind was against them at about the fourth watch of the night jesus came to them walking on the sea and he intended to pass by them when they saw him walking on the sea they supposed it was a ghost they cried out for they all saw him and they were frightened but immediately he spoke to them and said take courage it is i don't be afraid and he got into the boat with them and the wind stopped and they were greatly astonished now what strikes me in that story is that jesus was going to go right by him says he intended to it's like i want to ask him some questions about it wow where are we going to go well we're just going to leave him out there on the we're going to from the shore i don't know but it's like what he appears he's going to do he doesn't do you say so even more so jot down luke 24 verses 28 and 29 the two men on the road to emmaus after christ is resurrected they don't realize he's alive they're depressed they think he's dead but jesus is walking with them and they come to emmaus and they the three of them approached the village of emmaus where they were going and he what well he acted as though he would go farther in other words i'm not going to a man so i'm going to keep going on the road and they urged him saying stay with us it's it's almost evening and the day is now nearly over and he went and stayed with now well what's with that but where was it gonna go didn't didn't he want to re oh you know at the breaking of the bread he's going to reveal himself everything's going to change for that i know the rest of the story but what what what why don't worry about it bob i'm not worried about it i'm fascinated by it i'll tell you why because i believe these are two examples of something we're seeing over and over again in the old testament the lord is to rightly say i have a right to judge and i'm going to leave me alone it's going to happen without having any desire in his heart or plan to wipe his people out why this is all about what are you going to do moses because that is the situation what are you going to do about it this is moses's opportunity he's being what", "my point is is this when people around you who will call themselves christians or who are rebel against the lord and dishonor and dishonor you you're being what will you do with their rebellion say god has a right to wipe them out they're being a terrible you're right but will you leave god alone and leave them to what they deserve put this down remind god of his people his plans and his promises people plans and promises what does moses say after being told these are your people in verse 11 he says no no let's get that up let's get that pronoun right these are thou has brought them out he corrects your children are not your children as much as they are god's children he planned for them to exist before you they will exist in eternity they're his kids in verse 12 he calls him thy people moses says they're your people in other words they're your responsibility lord in verse 13 moses in essence says remember the promises you made you might think that sounds so offensive i've checked the contract here and i think you made some promises to abraham isaac and jacob and you know what do you know the lord loves it when you pray the word of god back to him when you pray his promises back to you know why because you're now praying in faith you know the disciples struggled with a lack of faith why couldn't we cast lack of faith littleness of faith why why did you doubt oh you have at one point the disciples finally say increase our faith that's exactly what how do you get more faith faith comes by and hearing the word concerning christ the word of god faith is built up through the word of god so what does god's word say god will do what does he promise to you take him to that he loves it he's not offended when you say god you promised you mean you beli you know it you read it you remember you believe it you're holding me to it good for you because as you believe my word of what i've said you're showing me that you believe that i mean what i said and i and now i can respond to it you see we need to learn god never gets he never throws his hands up and just says i'm done with that guy i'm done with that girl i'm sick of them see i know this i'm a dad when your children are difficult you don't go well i just i'm done now you", "may have moments where you say things like that you'll need to repent of those by the way so don't say them it doesn't matter if anybody else likes and you can understand why they don't you can fully because it was somebody else's kid you'd feel the same way but since your kid that never enters your mind you're in it for the well for the you'll love them till the end whether they change or not remember watching a guy at a conference he took out a hundred dollar bill he said i'm just curious how many of you if i were willing to give it to you would want this a real hundred dollar really raised their hand then he took a knee crumbled it all off it was all messed up he was well now how many won it same hands went up goes oh really put on the ground he went now who wants it same hands went up you see people can mess their lives up a they can dirty themselves and look nothing like what they should look like but god doesn't change how valuable they and he wants us to see them the way he well put this down god is faithful when in verse 15 and verse 16 then moses turned went down from the mountain with tablets of the testimony in his hand tablets which were written on both sides they were written on the one side and the other the tablets were god's work and the writing was god's writing on the tablets he jot down second timothy 2 13. if we are faithless he remains faithful for he cannot deny himself now just so you know because i know people get confused at this passage first paul says to timothy if we deny him he'll deny us because jesus said if you deny me i'll deny you before my father if you reject jesus christ you will be rejected by god once you come to believing and if and by the way when because you will be faithless at times he never will be faithless he never gives you back he will never do that why because he's made promises his name and reputation are on his promises he cannot and will himself and so even though his people are in rebellion deserving to be wiped out worshipping a golden calf and committing breaking law that he just gave as far as sexual sin i put this down he still delivers his inspired word to them he still is going to give them his word now it's interesting that it says these", "word his word is coming on two tablets it says moses was carrying two tablets somebody said the headache of god's people they should have been two extra strength etc in tablets um but they're written on both sides and i let me say to you i see this this principle we need to see and read all that god has said that's one of the reasons we study on wednesday night the old testament too many christians will go through the life they won't touch the old testament it's like i don't understand it it's boring uh there's too many he begat she you know so and so begat so-and-so so and so begat so and so so and so was it so and so and they just don't like um this is jesus's bible this is the only bible jesus had by the way is the one we're studying new testament was not written yet but it was written on both sides and may i suggest to you this principle we need to see not just one side of something that god has said it's been said nothing but a whole bible will ever do to make a whole christian paul the apostle said to the elders at i am free and not guilty of anybody's sin because i didn't shrink from declaring to you the whole council of god i gave it all to you i just give you little pet verses and little topics that i like to talk about or things that you'd like to i told you everything see sometimes people over emphasize god's love and neglect god's holiness you can't do that you can do it but that's a huge mistake to do that you need both you'll never ever ever appreciate god's love if you don't written on both sides i remember a woman years ago coming uh she called me actually didn't come after he called me he just started the started this study in the gospel of john where in hebrews so you can just do that as like decades ago but anyway um she said pastor i know you're in john 1 but in a few weeks you'll be in john 3 i thought well you don't know how slow i go but okay she goes and i just want to talk to you because i know you're going to be talking from john 3 16. everybody knows that verse and i said well i'm sure i'll get there and she said well you know i mean of course we all know what it says for god so loved the world that he gave", "his only son she said so i i just i want to make sure that when you get that you're going to make sure everybody knows when it says whosoever will that it doesn't really mean that i said excuse me well i knew she was reformed in her theology she said well i hope you're gonna go and bring in the reality that god shows the people who choose him and the only people that will will were the people that he already chosen that you'll make sure everybody understands i said when i get to romans it'll be a few years later when i get to to to romans 9 through you know 11 you you should be there for that one because i'm going to talk about the sovereignty of god because scripture has a lot to say about that but when i'm in a whosoever will passage that the holy spirit decided to put that in and not mention uh who he foreknew i am not going to emphasize what the holy spirit doesn't emphasize i have a sneaky suspicion the holy spirit kind of knows what's the balance in any passage we can get one-sided on things jesus said baptize people teaching them to observe what was the next word all that i commanded you not the things that really know ministry all that i've the writing was god's own writing with his finger he is the author it's written in stone i talked about this before meaning it oh there'll be new translations of the bible and people will argue about what's the best translation and on and on but god was the one who gave the autographs and it's permanent heaven and earth will pass away jesus said but my word will never pass away the grass withers the flower fades but he who does the will of god which is based on the word of god will abide forever it was written in stone not on a dry erase board it's interesting to me that god's law the old covenant was engraved on stones but the bible speaks of that word that is given to believers a little differently jot it down james 1 and not as engraved on stones but literally implanted on human hearts james 1 and 21 therefore putting aside all filthiness and all that remains of wickedness and humility receive the word engrafted king james says or implanted in asb which is able to save your souls i love the difference the old covenant was engraved on dead the letter kill paul says the letter of the law but god's new covenant is engrafted on", "human hearts you see it's alive the word implanted means something that you plant that's alive love it put this down see where sin inevitably leads in our text in verses 17 through 25 put the first one down it leads people from a battleground to a playground in verse 17. now when joshua the sound of the people so he's halfway up the mountain when this happens as they're shouting down below he says to moses there's the sound of war in the camp he thinks they've been attacked and there's a battle moses said it's not the sound of the cry of triumph nor is it the sound of the cry of defeat but it's the sound of singing that i hear in other words the people are not in a battle down there oh no they're having an orgy the bible says it very clearly and over and over again sin is pleasurable um sometimes people talk about oh you know before i was a christian i was in sin and my life was miserable it's like i get it but you know what i'm not sure which sins you're committing but the ones i used to come in i kind of liked to be honest with you sin is pleasurable the bible says for a season it's fun for a while but it makes you a slave jesus said he commits a sin as a slave to sin so the things that people say well i do this because i i can do whatever i want i want to do what you what god says if i want to smoke pot i'm going to smoke pot legal now i want to get high it's legal i want to get drunk i can get drunk in my own home i know god don't you know you christians are weird and you know jesus made water into wine here's the thing about sin it starts out you do it because you want to do it but you see i used to arrest heroin addicts all the time and drunk drivers all the time and alcoholics and i've known way too many whose lives have been and are continuing to be absolutely destroyed by that which is their choice it was their choice but now they can't get through the day it's not waiting for friday night to go party with their friends they can't get through the day without drinking they need another just to be normal and that which was now has become their master that's what sin that's what sin does and it takes you from the battleground you're supposed to", "be on into the playground and it was the time that kings go out to war normally david didn't need to he's got a general that can handle that he's established as the king so he's i'm not going out to war handle it handle it let's stay home and while he's not on the battleground we know the rest of how that story goes put this down we must accept sins bitter in verse 19 and 20. it says it came about as soon as moses came near the camp he saw the calf the dancing and moses's anger burned and he threw the tablets from his hands and he shattered them at the foot of the mountain and he took the calf which they had made and he burned it with fire and he ground it to powder and he scattered it over the surface of the water and he made the sons of israel we jot down jeremiah 2 and verse 19. here's what jeremiah said your own wickedness will correct you and your apostasies will reprove you know therefore and see that it is evil and bitter for you to forsake and the dread of me god said is not in you says the lord of hosts interesting this law that god gave to be a blessing to them is ground up and they will have to take it in now you say why did they do that did god tell them to do that was moses just angry at them well an interesting passage that we won't take time to discuss tonight we will when we get to the book of numbers is found in numbers five and god had a very interesting law concerning an unfaithful wife or a husband who was convinced his wife was cheating on him and there was a process of taking her into the temple where she would claim that she was faithful and he was jealous and so there was this this actual she would have to drink this water this water the holy water that had dust put in it and depending on how her body reacted it would determine whether or not if she was guilty she was drinking a curse into and her thigh would rot and actually speaks about her inability then probably to bear children after that if she was lying and so there was this way of determining infidelity by drinking this curse very interesting to me it was drinking the curse the very law that god gave to be a blessing to his people also was a curse if you if you see here's the thing jesus", "dies on the cross and it's salvation for the believer but it actually if you reject christ is your judge it's the that's why paul says in first corinthians be careful when you come to the lord's table for if you eat and unworthily you're just going through the emotions or you're living like sin but you're going through the motions you are eating and drinking condemnation literally in the greek cream of judgment to yourself you're bringing into your own self by your sin you are you're dishonoring you're not repenting of your sin you're just being religious and so here's the idea behind it god's curse if you will is coming into the people as a result of their choice of what they had done rebelling against god's laws doesn't erase or negate the law's effectiveness it's like saying well because i'm not obeying god gravity doesn't work it's just that's ridiculous of course it does put this down it leads sin leads to excusing sin or blaming others for the sin probably the most humorous part of this chapter if there is one if it's not meant to be but verse 21 through 24. then moses said to aaron what did this people do to you i may i just say that is very kind of i know you would have never just done this on your own mo you know aaron you're my second year my br you're of we're family you would you've gone through this whole thing with me so what did they do i mean they hold your wife hostage and they got your kids and what did this people do to you that you have brought such great sin upon them and aaron said don't let the anger of my you know the people yourself they are prone to evil now they said to me make a god for us who will go up before us for this moses the man who brought us up from the land of egypt we don't know what has become and i said to them well whoever has any gold let him tear it off now some believe that is trying to suggest i knew they wouldn't do that their gold earrings are too valuable to them so i was trying to avoid this all i was you using psychological warfare on them didn't work who i don't know if that's even reasonable but anyway chuck mentioned it so i'll mention whoever has any gold let him tear it off so they gave it to me and i threw it into the fire oh and now came this calf now this is interesting to me", "god through moses is giving aaron a chance to confess what he has allowed what he's been part of and to be forgiven what does aaron do the exact same thing that adam did when he was confronted who told you you're naked have you eaten of the tree in which i've forbidden you that would be a yes or no question there's not even multiple choice on that yes or no lie or tell the truth the woman isn't even on the answer sheet but that's what's sin when we're in sin that's what that's the go to by the way i've noticed when people get caught they want to tell you as little they'll deny it and then if they tell you they tell you this much of the truth that's just human nature by the way unfortunately whether it's your kids or well i won't get into the other kinds of things it could be adam did it king saul was supposed first samuel 15 wipe out the amalekites kill their judgment has come kill their animals you remember the story that was the mission samuel gives king saul saul does he wipe out the amalekites well sort of he almost completely obeyed now is that an oxymoron or what i like to say it's like being a little in fact he's convinced he totally he comes back blessed are you samuel i have a guy like me for a king blessed are you i have done the will of because you not only have a gag the king of the amalekites like a little war trophy here but you also have some animals that you're supposed to have if you've obeyed the lord what is this what's that about oh yeah that i can't have an explanation for you the people did you notice this kind of related the people i was terrified they they i just because i you're the king you're supposed to say i am the king oh no no because it's a lie he wanted to bring back a gag he wanted to bring back well i'm going to sacrifice those to the lord to obey is better than sacrifice well that's a good answer that's good someone should write a song about that and and you know the bottom line is this blaming of other people it is guilty with an explanation is the nature of it's who we are in our flesh it's interesting to me aaron does tell the story when it was uh with some truth well you were gone we didn't know where you were you know you could have texted me you didn't um", "some truth but he leaves out the part where he gave instructions to give him the earrings that he'd do it and he leaves out the complete part about how he built the altar he doesn't even billy sunday the baseball player turned evangelist used to say an excuse is a skin of a reason stuffed with a lie that's exactly what is going on here put this down number four sin leads to a life that is out of order in verse 25 we see the congregation of israel now when the lord saw that the people were out of control for aaron had let them get out of control to be a derision among their enemies not that he did that for that reason but that's what the results were the bible says where the spirit of the lord is there is liberty but the bible also says let all things be done decently and in order god is not a god of confusion so when there's confusion that's usually a result of strife carnality the pleasures of the flesh but it's a bad witness when god's people let the spiritual leaders or are not led by spiritual leaders but they're led by their own carnality you know the bible says where there is no vision finish that that verse anybody remember without vision the people perish we all know that verse but you need to know that's proverbs 29 18. in the hebrew you know what it really says where there is no vision the people are that's actually what the hebrew says where there's no vision true biblical leadership in a home in a marriage and a family in a church where there's no leadership the people while they're the one translation that word understand they just they're just given into the flesh put this down letter e see what the savior does for through the end then moses stood in the gate of the camp and he said whoever is for the lord come to me remember that him who is on the lord's side anybody remember that him came from this verse and all the sons of levi gathered together to him and he said to them thus says the lord the god of israel every man of you put his sword on his thigh go back and forth from gate to gate in the camp kill every man his and every man his friend and every man so the sons of levi did as moses instructed and about 3 000 men of the people fell that day then moses said now dedicate yourselves to the lord for", "every man has been against his son against his brother in order that he the lord may be still a blessing upon you today and on the next day moses said to the people you yourselves have committed a great sin and now i'm going to the lord perhaps i can make atonement for your sin then moses returned up to the mountain and the lord said alas this people has committed a great sin and they have made a god of gold for themselves but now this is moses speaking if you will forgive their sin and there's a pause there that's what that dash means he's asking him to forgive their sin he's waiting for god to say something and then he continues and if not then blot me out of your book which you take me out the lord said to moses whoever has sinned against me i'll blot him out of my book but go now lead the people where i told you behold my angels shall go before you nevertheless in the day that i punish i will punish them for their sin then the lord smote the people because of what they did with the calf which aaron let's put a few things down here and we'll finish first of all he calls them to come to him moses calls that people to come to him and to gather what a picture of who christ is that's exactly what he does he calls us to come to him and to gather together that's what we're doing tonight number two he calls them to take a stand in their own families in the midst of their mission before he could fight the midianites was to do what destroyed the altar and where was it and his backyard it was his father's start with your own home right there in your own family you can jot down matthew 10 we don't have time to get there but matthew 10 34-37 where jesus calls us to a relationship with him that will put us at odds with people in our own family and times put this down number three he speaks truth about sin and accepts its punishment what a picture of christ put in the word accepts the only other person we see in all of scripture that says anything like what moses says is paul in the book of romans i would be accursed if my people would let them be saved and let me be damned folks i i don't i don't know that any of us would say that but the only person who lived that out is jesus", "he became sin for us that we might be by god and then finally number four on his faithfulness cannot erase sins consequences god's faithfulness does not all of sin's consequences he says i i won't blot you out of my book but those who have sinned now you got to understand the blotting out of a book we kind of make this all spiritual and the book is up in heaven the book of life the fact is every city had a book placentia anaheim they all had a book of who's alive in the city for taxation they counted them the people that are alive the book of the living are oh it's money okay so that was the method so when you blotted somebody out it's because they died they're no longer alive the book of the living and then the people that are erased or that's the book of uh of life um and of course it does have spiritual significance in the new testament but god is saying i'm not going to blot you out i'm going to blot out the who is rebellious now you might think wait i thought god forgave them thought you know moses offered to make atonement and god doesn't destroy them and so i i mean didn't the people repent well actually if you look at the text it never says they repented never says they asked for forgiveness they just experienced mercy that they didn't deserve and frankly they haven't ever done what is necessary and so you have god's people receiving grace that they didn't deserve to continue to live god could have taken them out literally right then he doesn't take all of them out three thousand died the law was given day of pentecost when the new covenant is given three thousand are don't miss that reality and the fact is the bible says god doesn't change his mind but this text seems to say he will let me just and let me just say a word about that because i know it's like wait a minute what is how can god change his mind jonah goes and he proclaims in the ears of the people of nineveh 40 days and nineveh will be destroyed that was the word of god that was the judgment of god coming on them did god destroy nineveh well later but not in that book well wait a minute how could god change his mind i thought god is not a man or the son of man who changes his mind spoke that about the lord keep in mind what he was wanting what they", "the king balak wanted balaam to prophesy was judgment on his people and here's what what balaam was saying god will never change his mind about blessing his that's what he was talking about but the fact is let me put it this way you and i were born dead deserving hell jesus christ died on the cross and because of our faith in his finished work god has changed his mind about your eternal god will not change his mind about blessing his people but the finished work of christ brings us to a place where god's legitimate right to destroy us if you will if christ has changed god's mind to judge you there's nothing that can change god's promise to bless you let's all stand and sing together still my soul ten thousand years forever bless the lord i want to pronounce the benediction but i wanted you to do it with me so i put your hand up as an expression of and just say it with me the lord bless you and keep you lord make his face to shine upon you and be gracious unto you the lord lift up his countenance upon you and give you his peace in the name of the father and the son and the holy spirit god bless you good night", "it will affect your emotions if you stand on truth and so let's pray and consider all this and then give it to the Lord Lord thank you for what you're doing in and through this body of Believers this family I thank you for people finding a home people finding people finding a place to exercise their but it's all for your glory and we pray that it would be this morning we sing these

giving a call for anyone who God may be calling to be a part of youth ministry gen Z is under attack and on every side and I think we all know this is by looking at the news but just even seeing what's going on around us you don't need to look very far and wide to know that gen Z is under attacking though the devil hates them God loves them and I'm right on the edge of gen Z and Millennium around the edge so I'm like half and", "half but let me give you some statistics to even Pastor Bob shared at Easter what's going on in gen Z for one one in every three high school high school gen Z girls have seriously contemplated suicide we have 42 percent of gen Z has been diagnosed with some sort of mental health diagnosis we have 57 of high school girls with persistent sadness we have the hot the most uh unreligious generation of all time we also have 71 approving of same-sex marriage and only going up much higher in the College Years and all this to say is the devil H gen Z can get loves them and as a youth pastor I see the front lines of both what the devil's doing and what God is doing and the Bible says that we should pray that God would call laborers the Harvest is right but the laborers are few and I want to give a call if anyone here guys calling you pray about it you and our own see your pastor he gave us up to the Lord in junior high with a youth leader I believe God

Fellowship here at Calvary Chapel he's Anaheim so we'd love to see you 7 P.M Wednesday evening that's off thank you Josh did you open your Bibles please to First John chapter 2. first John chapter 2 and those of the folks that are here for the first time that are watching online good to have you with us first John 2 beginning in verse seven John writes this beloved I am not writing a new commandment to you but an old commandment which you have had from the beginning the old commandment is the word which you have heard on the other I am writing a new commandment to you which is true in him in Christ and in you because the darkness is passing away the True Light is already shining the one who says he is in the light and yet hates his brother is in the darkness until now the one who loves his brother abides in the light and there is no cause for stumbling in him but the one who hates his brother is in the darkness walks in the darkness doesn't know where he's going because the darkness has blinded his eyes father we are asking that your Holy Spirit would speak to this portion of your bride this morning you said repeatedly let him who has ears to hear hear what your spirit is saying to the churches and Lord we thank you that John recorded these words in part for us and so we ask that you would use your word like a scalpel lovingly but surgically coming to the heart of things Lord and where there is a need to grow in our love you would help us to do that Lord where there's a need for us to see things that are not", "right in US Open our eyes even if it's hard for us that you might forgive us and free us that we might become more like you for it's in Jesus name we pray amen you can be seated so my first experience with Calvary Chapel was in 1973 that was a long time ago and I had heard there was a playing on a Saturday night and uh for me uh Christian and rock and roll those were like that's an oxymoron those didn't go together up until that time I'd never heard any Christian rock and roll music but it was beginning at Calgary Costa Mesa on Saturday nights in a tent and so I went down there with my friends and uh it was it was love song it was my first experience there it was a great concert it was awesome uh the place was packed with people kind of my age and slightly older maybe into their early 20s at the oldest and probably 2 000 people there we actually sat on the grass because we didn't get there early enough for a for a seat and I enjoyed the concert there's no question about it but I remember feeling this way about the crowd there they were different than the Christians I had ever read into I went to church every Sunday at a church here in Placentia it was a good solid Bible teaching Church of people that knew the Lord but this church was that I visited was very different not just was it younger but there was something else and I wasn't sure they were very very vocal and very very into the worship like you guys are and they uh I remember because people would raise their hands and people were excited people shout out praise the Lord hallelujah just like well we don't really do that at our church they're a little a little too enthusiastic here but that's fine and I remember feeling a little uncomfortable there like I don't really I'm not sure I belong here and my thought was I'm a Christian these people are Jesus Freaks and so I don't know what's wrong with them I know I'm okay and um because you know we always measure Everybody by our own experience and and I remember thinking good for them they have this great experience here one wonderful people are getting saved and all that because a lot of people went forward to receive the Lord but I and I was heading out Jared long hair he just saw me and he bear hugged me and I'm thinking I don't know you any", "God bless you praise the Lord Brother and I remember just thinking thank you very much and the boys when do you hug and you don't want to hug you kind of tap each other on the shoulders like enough I'm tapping out and uh we did at the church I went to menden hug at the you know in the high school I attended we certainly didn't hug the guys it was just kind of weird and I remember thinking I am never coming back to this church ever they're weird here and um about a week or two later I remember I was in my car I remember exactly where I was alone and I felt like God spoke to me because I was thinking about what's wrong with those people and uh and the Lord spoke to my heart and he said well here's what's different about those people they are in love with Jesus and they don't mind talking about it they don't mind shouting about it they they want to celebrate their love for the Lord and that's something that you have a hard time doing Bob I was like but the problem was with them you know and I thought well that's probably true and I probably should be a little more enthusiastic about Jesus and and I do love him and and then what dawned on me and the Lord spoke to me is Bob they love each other and they want to show it they want to show the whole world that they are in love with me and in love with each other the love of God is there and you know as the conviction of the Holy Spirit fell upon me guess where I was the next and the next Saturday and the next Saturday for years I attended Calvary Chapel every concert and brought our friends so many of them to Faith from our high school we didn't know how to share the gospel we bring him down there and Tom Stipe and the other pastors would give the gospel up and it was very interesting this transformation in my heart as I was brought in through the love of God though at first it was frankly weird and a little strange and uncomfortable now why do I share that because we're going to be studying a lot about the love of God in first John but I don't want you just to study it I want you to ask with me God would you pour out a spirit of love that is so infectious that we if we have to are the", "weird ones to those people that are visiting here may they know that we love them and we love you let them walk away for a while you'll convict their hearts too but Lord would you bring people in to this Fellowship a lot of us have found the fellowship of God's people here we love it we enjoy it we have friends here but we sometimes forget we were that person visiting for the first time and sometimes they're all alone and I want to encourage you starting today in a new way to start having eyes to see those people and by the way at the end of this service for those who can if you've come over the last few weeks since Easter Good Friday and I haven't had a chance to meet you I want to meet you today I'm not asking you to come up to the front where I usually pray with people I'm going wherever you are I'm going to be in the courtyard we have free donuts and coffee we just I just want to meet you so if you would if you can't get your kids or come just come back and say hello that's all I'm asking but I want to be part of this too so in our text today we're going to talk about walking in love but we're going to talk a lot more about about it in this epistle we said in the first chapter John is talking about walking in the light what does that mean God is light we are to walk in fellowship with God in obedience uh to him but we walk in fellowship with the Lord the second chapter is about obeying the commands of God and we talked about that last week motivated not because we have to but because we love the Lord we're motivated to obey him now we know this in the scriptures Jesus said the evidence that were really his followers it's very interesting he pointed to one thing Remember by this shall all men know you're my disciples if you vote Republican that's not what by this shall all men know you're my disciples if you have love for one another it is the ultimate apologetic to a lost world you and I have the privilege of loving each other though we're very different from each other we come from very different backgrounds the love of God breaks those barriers down and we actually get to enjoy agape love with but listen to me guys it's not just that the world can tell there's something different about it something that they", "need and long for that we have that we're followers of Jesus the love of God between ourselves is also hear me the proof that we're really saved not just the unsaved world can tell that we are his followers but we can tell ourselves that we're Christians you say where do you get that I'm glad I asked first John 3 14 jot it down here's what it says we know John says we Believers know we have passed out of death into life why because we love the brethren in other words part of the proof that you're saved isn't that you just obey God's Commandments out of love but that you actually love God's people so how's that proof of life going for you I remember in the 70s that's like I just told you about um there was a commercial on TV I know all the commercials I'm that's why so many illustration I was hooked on TV and uh it was an ultra bright commercial I don't even know if ultra bright exists anymore with toothpaste and their tagline was how's your love life remember that because ultra bright gives you sex appeal you know there's a girl's lips on someone's face anyway but the idea was they kept asking these people how's your love life well can I tell you I don't care about that commercial or that toothpaste don't buy it what I want to tell you is I think God is going to be asking us in this book this question Calvary Chapel East Anaheim how's your love life how's your relationship with the Lord and how's your relationship with each other because if we don't deal with this honestly if we just ignore this like this is somebody else's problem Satan's gonna have a foothold and keep it on some of us now love as we know is this beautiful word that the world loves to sing songs about and everybody talks but someone said words are kind of like coins when they have been in circulation a long time they can actually lose their value and you hear people say well you know we don't need to get married because we love one another that's kind of bizarre to me you know well we have sex we're not married but it's okay because we love one another I I would call that a fulfillment of Love covers a multitude of sins we need to understand what the love of God is and how it expresses itself in our relationships put this down it is and according to this passage something something old and something new in verse", "7 beloved I am not writing a new commandment to you I'm writing an old commandment you've had it from the beginning the old commandment is the word which you have Matthew 13 and verse 52 Jesus said something that I think is wonderful he therefore every scribe expert in the who has become a disciple of the Kingdom of Heaven is like ahead of a household who brings forth out of his treasure and things old and here we're going to be told there's an old commandment and there is a new commandment that has to do with love we need to know both of them put this down see the old commandment is still in full force and jot down Luke 10 verses 25 through 28 Behold a certain lawyer stood up and put Jesus to the test saying teacher what shall I do to inherit eternal life and he said to him well what is written in the law how does it read to you and he answered and he said You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart with all your soul with all your mind and all your strength and your neighbor as yourself and Jesus said to him you have answered correctly do this and you we know that that the first and primary commandment of the Old Testament from Deuteronomy 6 is to love God it's all got to start there and we only love because he first loved us he showed us love he's deserving of our love we start with loving God but then the law is only fulfilled in not just loving God most of us don't have a hard time loving God and what's not about him the love he is love everything's lovely about him but it's the other part that makes it much more difficult it's loving people and those aren't so easy to love oh some people are the ones that are nice to us you know they liked me I'll put a like and a little heart on their Facebook post too you know I love them yeah well that might have some things to say about what love really is now I want to say something about the passage love your neighbor as yourself because that's taken from Luke 19. you might jot it down Luke 19 verses 17 and 18 if we have that slide we'll show it to you if not I'm going to turn there and read it to you Leviticus 19 verse 17 and 18. you shall not hate your fellow countrymen in your heart you may surely reprove your neighbor but you", "shall not incur sin because of him listen to this you shall not take Vengeance nor bear any grudge against the sons of your people but you shall love your neighbor as yourself I am the Lord very interesting the context of you shall love your neighbor as yourself first has to do with God saying you're not to hate your one another you're not to hold grudges against each other why is that interesting because sometimes you'll hear people say from the pulpit we are to Love The Sinner but hate the sin and hate the sin Love The Sinner but a lot of times people go how do you that's not how do you really do that actually it was C.S Lewis who said you know what I discovered one day I've been doing it my whole life with myself I hate the sin in myself I hate pride in me I hate gossiping I hate arrogance I hate all these bad attitudes and desires I I hate it but I never stop loving and that's exactly the key if you are going to love your neighbor as yourself then you're gonna love them you're gonna hate the sin that's the idea they're in Leviticus 19 and the Old Testament taught God's people that we are to do jot down Romans 13 verses 8 through 10 listen to what Paul said about the importance of loving each other he said oh nothing to anyone except to love one for he who loves his neighbor has fulfilled the law for this you shall not commit adultery you shall not murder you shall not steal you shall not covet and if there's any other commandment it is summed up in the saying you shall love your neighbor as yourself why love does no wrong to a neighbor Love Therefore is the Fulfillment of the law you understand what he's saying if you actually love your neighbor you don't need a rule thou shall not steal from your neighbor you love you wouldn't steal from them if you love them you won't kill them if you love them you won't lie to them or commit adultery with their spouse you see love is the Fulfillment of all that's why Augustine is reported as saying he actually wrote it in a sermon he said love God and do what you will if you love the Lord if you are full of the love of God you will find that you don't need a bunch of rules to live your life by legalistically you'll find yourself completely obeying the law put this down when it comes to love you need", "to know what's new in verse 8. on the other hand I am writing a new commandment and this word new does not mean new in time but literally fresh to us in a new way new to you which is true in him and it's new in you because the darkness is passing away now this new commandment that's given first of all we need to realize is new in emphasis that love is somehow raised up above all the other Commandments that if we love will fulfill the Commandments remember what Paul said in First Corinthians 13 without love is nothing it's that essential to it now abide Faith open love but the greatest of these is agape love it's not only new in its emphasis for us as Believers it's new because we have an example in the person and life of Jesus Christ we're also learning something about it being new in what sense to the extent that we're to love jot down John 13 and verse 34. Jesus had a new commandment I give you they already had Leviticus love your neighbor as yourself but a new commandment I give to you that you love one another here it is even as I have loved you not just as you love your but as I have loved you that you also love one another you say well what's the difference it's kind of like this I make a nice sandwich for myself you're my neighbor if I love you as I love myself I cut the sandwich in half you get half and I get half I'm loving you as I love but if I love you the way Jesus has loved you and loved me you get my whole sandwich right isn't that true he gave everything what did Jesus say listen greater love this is John 15. greater love has no man then he laid down his life for his and I've called you friends he said but think about there is a greater love well Jesus said there's not greater love has no men than he laid down his life person yeah for a man that's it but the Greater Love is that you would lay your life down for your enemy that's what Jesus did jotted down Romans 5 verses 6 through 8. for while we were still helpless at the right time Christ died for the ungodly one will hardly die for a righteous man though perhaps a marine will jump on a grenade for his friends for the good man someone perhaps would even die but God demonstrates his own love toward us in that while we were", "yet sinners we were God's enemies Christ died for us that's the kind of love that God has for us to love even our enemies now loving our neighbor that's nice we agree with that loving our enemy seems nuts to us who does that nobody does that the Lord did that and he did it by the way in receiving and accepting me and you into and it's to be a new experience in our lives it's new in him by his example it's new in Us by our experience what am I talking about in The Book of Romans it says this having been justified by faith we have peace with God and we have received our introduction into this grace in which we now stand then it says the holy spirit of God has been poured out in our hearts and he pours out the love of God he just pours it he lavishes the love of God in us God is asking you to take of the reservoir of mercy and love that he's given you and simply give it away but it's his love remember the fruit of the spirit is agape love it's what he creates within us he's not asking you to muster it up he's asking you to Simply love the way that he has loved you and he's willing to give you the love to do it you see when you become a Christian you start to love what you used to hate and you start to hate what you used to love put this down letter be let God deal with the depths of your bitterness but in the word depths and look at verse the one who claims he's in the light in others walking in fellowship with God whose love and in obedience yet hates his brother is in the darkness until now hating people Paul says is a natural of our old life before we were saved now maybe you were a very loving person before you were saved I don't know but Paul would be honest enough to admit he wasn't and if a lot of us are honest that's a part of our fleshly nature that we used to be much more involved in maybe it's been too long and you forgot what you used to be like I often say at my own baptism it was a funeral but nobody misses nobody cried oh the old Bob was like we miss him no nobody was missing the old Bob especially me jot down Titus 3 and verse 3 it's a verse that's a testimony of the Apostle Paul's previous life and not him alone", "he says we for we Believers also once were here we are foolish ourselves we were disobedient we were deceived we were enslaved of various lusts and Pleasures we spent our life in Malice and envy hateful and hating one another well don't sugarcoat it Paul tell us how you really feel remember Jesus is talking to the Jews and he says you are of your father the now I don't recommend that as a witnessing technique with non-christians but he was just telling the truth you are of your father the devil and you want to do the D it's proof that you were sons of the devil because you're just acting like the devil you are seeking to kill me a man who told you the truth oh you have a demon you know we know I'm trying to kill you and and besides Abraham's our father now you're of your father the devil you're just and he said the devil was a liar he's the father of lies and he's a murderer and you have hatred in your heart you need to remember the devil is the original hater he drinks haterade he's trying to get you to drink it as somebody wrote this about hatred and I like it so I'll read a people that hold on to hate for so long do so because they want to avoid dealing with their pain they falsely believe if they forgive they're letting their enemy believe they're a doormat what they don't understand is hatred can't be isolated or turned off it manifests in their health their choices their belief system their values and their religious beliefs make adjustments to justify their negative emotions not unlike malware infesting a hard drive their Spirit slowly becomes corrupted and they make choices that don't make logical sense to others hatred left unaddressed will crash a person's spirit someone wrote this hatred is revenge against our own self for Deeds committed by someone else I think a lot of us don't want to be honest sometimes about what's going on inside of our hearts Jesus said of the Jews that he said hated him he said you can't understand what I'm saying because you can't hear it it not only causes you to be blind to spiritual realities about yourself but you cannot you will not hear God speak that concerns me today if there's someone here and you have hatred in your heart that you're going to find an excuse I hope these other people are listening I hope these haters here and what about you well not not me there's no problem here I'm good to go Bob thank", "you for asking read an article this last week fascinating the bombs of World War II are still killing people in Europe did you know this they turn up and sometimes blow up at construction sites fishing nets on beaches 78 years after the guns fell silent beneath the rolling Farmland of Northeastern France lies A Deadly Secret of world war one hundreds of thousands perhaps millions of unexploded Bombshells every year Farmers treasure Hunters hikers or curious children are killed or maimed because a mishandled or misidentified shell going off unexploded bombs become more dangerous with time with the corrosion inside the weapon becomes more unstable and the Detonator can be exposed what is true of lingering bombs is also true of lingering anger buried anger will explode sometimes when we least expected maybe you've heard that expression oh Time Heals all wounds that's baloney not Bible by the way the fact is time does not heal all wounds God can heal all wounds but quite often time just makes wounds Fester it's interesting to me that Jesus rose God didn't even erase Christ's wounds he chose to redeem the wounds instead remember Jesus Christ you used his wounds to prove that he was actually really risen from the dead with Thomas and I want to tell you something your wounds may be in your life from what somebody has done the rest of your life but don't think that's going to make you disabled it's all about what you decide to do and allow whether you let God heal you put this down be a stepping stone not a stumbling block put in the word Stone and block a look at verse 10 the one who loves his brother abides in the light and there is no cause for stumbling in him see one of the problems we have is when somebody wrongs us or offends us is we kind of take that to the bank and we feel like they're wrong and they may well be wrong but then we use that as an excuse to do wrong ourselves come Wednesday night we're going to talk about Moses losing his free trip to the Holy Land and why that happened in numbers 20. but more importantly whether you can come or not realize that this is our nature we get offend we take offenses and then we often keep them remember Jesus was coming into Capernaum by the way that was his headquarters where he did Ministry it's where Peter lived the Bible tells us that as they came and the people that collected the tax said to Peter hey doesn't your master pay the", "and so Peter went to Jesus and Jesus said hey Peter you know the foreign Kings uh charge money to their own children or to the foreigners and he said well just to the foreigners he goes right he goes the children and are exempt we I'm you know I'm the Son of God we should not have to be paying but then you know what he said go take a fishing pole go down to the Sea of Galilee take out a fish the first fish that comes up will have a coin in its mouth and go he said and pay the tax lest we stumble them in other words they're totally wrong about collecting this tax we're right but it doesn't matter love doesn't just say I'm right that's all that matters oh no love cares about the relationship that's been damaged and is unwilling to allow it to stay that way you know many years ago our church was in a small Sanctuary done on Orangethorpe for about 17 years we had one door in and one door out everybody had to come through that door and I had a friend who had uh he was older than me but he and I used to go out to lunch he would take me to lunch when I was a detective at uh Placentia Police Department about once a week and I had known him since I was 16 basically we attended the same church but he was a good friend his name was Bob Hendricks and Bob came to our church our small church maybe 125 people at that time and I'll never forget Bob showed up to church in a suit I mean a tie in a suit every Sunday and since he was my friend I said you know hey Bob where I know the church we used to go to everybody dressed up like that I go about this Calvary Chapel I mean I wear Hawaiian shirts and you know people sometimes come with flip-flops on him you don't have to dress up I mean I don't care if you want to but you're the only one he he said oh you don't understand Bob I don't dress up because I want to dress up like that for church he said I only do that for one reason that somebody else might visit our church who doesn't know that everybody else comes casual and they would stick out like a sore thumb and then they could look over and go well at least I'm not the only idiot there's one and he goes I do this so that everybody else", "church Bob used to stand by the door everybody had to get by Bob and you were going to get a hug whether you liked it or not man and it wasn't because I told him now make sure you hug every person because we're a loving church and now is this because the love of God was in him in fact his life had radically changed from the time I originally met him in high school and I saw him just reaching out loving people and I said hey Bob I've seen a real growth in your life and he said well there was a book that I read in fact he had copies of it in his shrunk I didn't realize that he gave me a copy of it he wanted me to read he gives them out to everybody and it was a by a man named Henry Drummond a a classic book called the greatest thing in the world the greatest thing in the world you know it was a study of First Corinthians 13 that now abide faith hope and love but the greatest of these is love as he started studying the love of God he knew that this is what God wanted to do and God just started pouring love into him and through him now you often have heard me talk about D.L Moody he was the Evangelist in the 19th century that led so many people to Christ and he's an example in many ways of his faith his his ministry but he shares some things about himself that I think are worth mentioning today Diel Moody said of his early preaching this is a quote I preached God hated Sinners and he was standing behind Sinners with a double-edged sword ready to cut off he said I allowed then a young man by the name of Henry Morehouse to come preach for me in Chicago while I was when I returned my wife said you know he preaches a little different than you he actually preaches God loves Sinners he's he said Moody but he backed up everything he says with the Bible she thereafter Morehouse preached night after night on John 3 16. Moody then recounted I never knew up to that time that God loved us so much this heart of Mind began to thaw out I could not keep back the tears I just drank it in I tell you there is one thing that draws above everything else in the world and that's love he said I took up that word love and I do not know how many weeks I spent studying the passages in", "which it occurs till At Last I could not help loving people I had been feeding on God's love so long that I was anxious to do everybody good I came in contact with I got full of it it ran out my fingers you take up the subject of love in the Bible you will get so full of it that all you have to do is open your lips and a flood of the love of God will pour out see when the spirit of God who is love fills you you don't need to be reminded to love people you you won't need to purpose to love people because you won't be able to stop yourself from loving people the spirit of God will fill you and overflow you naturally supernaturally put this down let the Lord open your eyes if need be to your blind hatred in verse 11 the one who hates his brother is in the dark and walks in the dark and does not know where he's going he's lost because the darkness has blinded his eyes so let me ask you a question ready here it is do you hate anyone is there somebody you hate I don't want you to shout it out but who is it who do you is there somebody there that you hate you say if you keep talking about this it's going to be you see I I know for some of you as I asked that question a face comes to mind a face you don't prefer to think about a name a Rolodex somebody maybe a whole there's a bunch of list you've got 10 now for everybody maybe it's a boss that you work for or that you one time worked for maybe it is a parent maybe it's both your parents maybe it's a sibling or a son or a daughter who have hurt you maybe it's a current or X that if you're honest you hold hatred toward though you don't like to call it see it's so often we just don't we know we're not supposed to hate so you know oh Pastor Bob I don't hate him I just don't like them a whole lot you know what Jesus said if you love those who love you what's the difference between you and atheists love those who love them there's no difference at all that Jesus said love your enemies pray for those that are hurting you pray for those who persecute you then you'll be like your father who is in heaven who sends the sun and the rain on both the just and the UN", "just you say oh I I pray for him I pray David's prayer in Psalm 58 break their teeth o God in their mouth yeah that doesn't count doesn't count holding a grudge like is like someone said letting someone live rent free in your head you got somebody living there unforgiveness is the poison you drink every day hoping the other person will like acid it destroys the vessel in which it's stored if malice were tangible and had a shape it would be in the shape of a boomerang unforgiveness is like a is like burning down your own house to kill a rat and forgiveness is letting the prisoner Go free and discovering you were the prisoner each one of those has volumes to speak to us you know this idea of you being the prisoners right out of the Gospel in Matthew 18. that man who had been released of all that debt that he could never pay back by the king but refuses to release a small debt to a guy who owed him a little bit forced him to pay it and he winds up in prison that's what unforgiveness will do it'll take the key and lock you up if you want to see the destructive of hatred and how it works out study the Book of Esther Haman hated the Jews primarily because he hated one particular Jew named Mordecai he hated him because God was blessing Mordecai and he was Jewish he decided he was going to die the Jews were all going to die he had with his own money built these Gallows for Mordecai to die who dies on those Gallows Haman does that's exactly right it's a good picture of what I'm forgiveness and hatred does put this down ask God to cross out and cure your bitterness in your heart if you have it today ask him to cross out and cure your bitterness today jot down Ephesians 4 let know the Greek is rotten here but it's translated unwholesome let no unwholesome word proceed from your mouth but only such a word as is good for building others up according to the need of the moment that it may give Grace to those who hear and then he says this don't grieve the Holy Spirit by whom you were sealed for the day of redemption let all bitterness and wrath and anger and clamor and slander be put away from you along with all Mouse be kind to one another tenderhearted forgiving each other just as God in Christ is also forgiven you you say well I don't know how to forgive", "well let's simplify what it means first because the word forgive is used all through the New Testament it's used right there in Ephesians 4 and it's the the Greek word afie me you don't need to remember that but you do need to remember what its basic meaning is the word me literally means to release to let go so let me make it really clear to you to letting them go and it means letting whatever they did against you go Let it go I believe that is God's word for every person in this room who is holding any ought toward anybody else let it go you say Bob I I wish I could I don't know how good because I'm about to tell you how you can do it and if it's not you and you need to minister this truth to somebody you know then you take notes jot down Exodus 15 verse 23 remember the children of Israel are in the desert they have no water they are dying of thirst they see water they run to the water only it's undrinkable here's what it says and when they came to Mara they could not drink the Waters of Mara for they were bitter therefore it was named bitter that's what the word Mara means in other words the water was either salty or they couldn't drink it here they're dying of thirst now they're really angry and upset and Moses wisely not knowing what to do with the angry group of people goes to the Lord with it Exodus 15 and verse 25 then Moses cried out to the Lord and the Lord showed him a what say it out loud and he threw the tree into the waters the waters became sweet miracle and there God made for them a statute and a regulation and there he tested them can I tell you something your bitterness the hurt that's come into your life is a time of testing here's the fact there is a tree I don't think it takes a lot of figuring out what that tree refers to the cross of Jesus Christ is the one tree that God wants to open your eyes to to see that Jesus already died for everything that has come into your life everything that has ever hurt you by another person Jesus already paid for it he wants to open your eyes to that and you have to add the tree he won't do it he's done everything he can everything that's necessary but you have to see it you have to add the tree you have to say", "Lord how could I possibly hate these people who you died for I know I do but I know I shouldn't I need to forgive them you wouldn't command me to do something I can't do now he will command you to do things listen to me that you can't do without Jesus said to the man with the withered arm stretch forth your arm until Jesus said it he couldn't do it but because he said it he could do it do you understand the difference if he's commanding you to forgive trust him he'll give you the ability but if you say I can't I I really I don't know that I can't or I just I don't want to Ah you see that's the real problem because the Bible says I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me but you need to will to obey God ask God to cross literally cross out and cure your bitterness today you don't have to with that unforgiveness of in your heart in fact it's your choice if you do it and say well Bob I I know you preach that I know other people preach that but what that person did to me deserves to be punished can I just tell you what God says to you when you say that you are absolutely right it deserves to be punished and the Lord says that's why I punished It 2 000 how could I ever say you'll get what's coming to you when Jesus got what was coming to me how can you do that see when it comes to God's mercy some of us have a attitude that is willing to but can't dish it out oh God please I'm so glad I've noticed this about me I am very merciful to me I've shared before you know what I notice is my driving you know when people are driving too fast the cop comes out of me I sometimes go to put on my red lights forget oh I don't have those anymore you know where's the cop when you need him you idiots out here driving this way and running there yeah guy went right through the red light did you see I'll say Becky did you see that full red right through it but when I do it oh I'm so kind I I oh I I timed it wrong I meant to I would have stopped if had I known I gassed it and I still didn't make it oh uh you know it's okay I kind of oh sorry if you won't someone listen to me because this is the", "Lord's word not mine if you won't forgive somebody you can't receive forgiveness from the Lord say what do you mean Jesus gave seven petitions to pray said when you pray pray like this one of them was forgive us our sins our trespass our debts as we forgive those who trespass see I don't mind it's like God forgive me I know you forgive everybody for everything and I'm going to be oh forgive me my trespasses to the degree that I forgive others there's only one of the seven petitions Jesus even gives commentary on and it's that one go read it Matthew he says for if you will not forgive your brother from your heart neither will your heavenly Father in Heaven forgive now am I saying you're going to hell no if you're a saved person you're not losing your salvation but you will break your fellowship with God and if you deceive yourself into thinking everything's good between you and God and you're not forgiving you're wrong won't forgive you can't receive forgiveness from God by the name of uh Oglethorpe General Oglethorpe famous guy in the British army once was talking to John Wesley about forgiveness and he said Mr Wesley I never forgive you know what Wesley said he said sir then I hope you never sin I hope you never sin and he was talking about that very we receive Mercy that's what it says give you know that verse has been taken out of context and used to preach about giving money have you give it'll be given on to you that's not what that verse is about he's talking about Mercy give Mercy let me just ask you this way how much Mercy would you like from God as much as I need I want a ton of Mercy okay how much are you giving out as much as I can squeeze out in a good mood it's up to you you give Mercy it will be given to you in the same measure that you gave it out you said well that could be a problem and here's the probably the hardest thing to say but I need to if you don't and there's a possibility you've never you go back and read Matthew 18. that's that man who has forgiven all that go read where he ends up the idea is if you're not forgiving the question becomes did you ever actually receive it because there's not a people on this planet or in history who should have more capacity to forgive than us nobody's been forgiven more we have this Reservoir that's boundless", "so if we have nothing to give here the did I ever actually receive it at all that's pretty radical my prayer for us is that as a church we will do more than study first John and learn a few things I want us to live these things I want to learn to live them I want you and me to help people that come to this church I don't care how big this church gets or never adds one more person I want every person that walks in the doors to know that the love of God is here and the only way for that to is for me and you to show them right at the end of the service I'm hope if you're new if you've come I get to meet you but you know what I'm actually hoping for as much if not more is that every person in this room will have eyes to see somebody they've never and if you're going to be that weirdo you don't have to shout out hallelujah praise the Lord Brother if you just would go say hello to somebody because there are people that come every week who are looking for what you and I have found here the love of God and now it's it's our turn maybe you brought somebody with you invite them to meet me invite them to meet some other folks here be the I call it the velcro in the body of Christ where people can find finally attached somewhere they don't have to keep coming to this church our goal is not to get them to come to our church our goal is that they might know the love of God some of them know the Lord and they're looking for a church that will be accepting of them some of them come from small churches that they come here and go this is too big other people come from Jack hibs are going this is too small as it this is not the right church for but if the Lord is bringing us people then let's assume he wants us to show them the love of God maybe you have some friends you could introduce them to at the end of the service I pray you would do that I don't want to pray for us right now I want you to close your eyes and bow your heads I seldom do this but I want you to do this for me today would you please close your eyes and I want to to be honest to God right now when I asked you is there somebody that you're", "holding ought against you're angry at them you're you're hurt and you're mad and and you don't know what to do about it yes you agree the cross is the answer but you don't know how to release it you know you have to let it go because God's commanding you to do that but you need if that's you today and you want to deal with it now you feel like God is speaking to you and saying let it go and you're saying I will if you'll help me I want you while our eyes are closed on our heads are about just to stand up right where you are you don't have to say anything just stand up if you're dealing with this in your heart you know it God's spirit has spoken to you there's several of you and there's more of you here be honest just stand up I'm going to lead you in a prayer you're not gonna have to pray it out loud but if you want to forgive but you don't know that you can or you don't know how or you know this has been an issue for a long time but it's time to date stand anybody else or many of you that are praise God we'll wait just a moment I want you to be honest there comes a moment when that woman says I've gone to the doctors I've done everything I can and I'm still bleeding out I need to Touch the Hem of His Garment or nothing's going to change may God give you Faith to obey him he'll give you the strength to do it if you'll be willing to make the decision now that those of you are standing I'm asking you to pray you can pray silently this prayer but pray it from your heart dear you died for all my sins and for the sins that have been committed against me for holding on to what you have already paid for cleanse my heart of my anger my my claiming the right to be resentful you say Let It Go then help me and with your help I do I forgive God help me to live in the forgiveness and forgive me and fill me with your spirit now release that pain that pressure that burden that I've been carrying so that I might reflect you in Jesus name I pray amen you guys can sit down now you guys can sit down you have to now choose to walk in that the Bible says in the Book of Proverbs for lack of would the fire goes out", "where there is no tale Bearer there is no Strife or The Strife ceases that's true of worry that's true of fear true of unforgiveness you need to stop feeding the fire what do I mean by that stop talking about what that person has done to you stop focusing on it because when we're hurt we want other people to know that someone hurt us so they can say yeah they're mean they're bad I hate them too knock it off stop feeding the unforgiveness and the anger and the hurt the Bible said whatever is true lovely pure excellent worthy of Praise think on these things if you go there's nothing worthy of Praise about them then don't think about them by the way forgiveness is not the same Jesus still had scars okay you may carry scars the rest of your life that's not the same as forgiving you say well I still hurt forgiving does not mean there's no hurt and by the way forgiving does not the same as Trust forgiving the person doesn't mean now I'm going to let him back under my life absolutely not if they're not trustworthy that's a separate issue forgiving means you are going to stop wishing they'd be punished that they would be hurt by God or that their lives would fall apart or that you would see them receive consequence for what they've done to you just as the Lord has forgiven you for the consequences eternally of what he's done for you amen so say Lord I want to live that out now I do want everybody to stand and you can come forward if you want we're going to sing a couple songs or whatever we have time for before we go home be upon you and thousands of generations are you here behind you well my prayer is that we would do more like I said than come to church hear a message and say I agree with that or some of it or most of it but what does God want to do the Bible says be doers of the word and not hearers merely hearers who delude themselves so my prayer is that you'll say Lord forgive me if in fact open my eyes if there's somebody I got chained to the wall still like the old song said Lord I I need to get that right I need to forgive and by the way Jesus you're my example you took the initiative you forget people that weren't asking father forgive them they know not what they're doing as they're crucifying him that's our example", "Stephen said the same thing as they were stoning him to death May that kind of love which is impossible for us to muster up it has to come from God to love people who do not love us who do not like us then it certainly will reach out and love to the people that are around us and say Lord forgive me if I have held on to something or if I've started being only about myself and my friends because Jesus said if you just greet those who greet you that's easy that's why I'm asking you to greet people who will never greet you even today and here's really the prayer I'm asking you guys to agree with me in prayer about Lord we're seeking not just to be containers of Your Love channels like DL Moody said fill us with loved where it's coming out of us we but love the people around us so Calvary Chapel how's your love life go love the people around you and if there's a new person bring them out I'd", "going to share from Matthew chapter two if you want to open your Bibles you can follow along there if not it'll be on the screen Matthew chapter two so let's stand for the reading of the word of God and then I will pray for the service now after Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judea and the days of Herod the King Magi from the east arrived in Jerusalem saying where is he who has been born King of the Jews for we saw his star in the east and we've come to worship Him and when Herod the King heard this he was troubled and all Jerusalem with him gathering together all the chief priests and the scribes of the people he inquired of them where the Messiah was to be born next slide thank you they said them in Bethlehem of Judea for this is what has been written by the prophet and you bethlehem land of Judah are by no means least among the leaders of judah for out of you shall come forth a ruler who will be shepherd of my people Israel then herod secretly called the Magi and determined from them the exact time the star appeared and he sent them to Bethlehem and he said go and search carefully for the child and when you have found him report to me so that I too may come and worship Him and after hearing the King they went their way and that's star which they had seen in the East went on before them until it came and stood over the place where the child was when they saw the star they rejoiced exceedingly with great joy after coming into the house they saw the child with Mary his mother and they fell to the ground and they worshiped him and then opening their treasures they presented him gifts of gold and frankincense and having been warned by God dream not to return to Herod the Magi left for their own country by another way well let's pray Lord we want to go home a different way than we came because we have worshiped Jesus we want to be yours completely given over to you we do want to celebrate your birthday sis in a way that would honor you and so would you today even give us the gifts the idea is Lord that you would have us to give for you we asked everybody else but I don't know that many of us have F actually asked you what you want for your birthday what do you want for christmas so Lord would you come and minister that", "to our hearts through the scriptures in jesus name amen you can be seated so you guys some of you many of you have already filled out a blue card and thank you for doing that and but I want you to know that if you happen it's not too late we're going to actually break out of the service at a certain point late in the service will blow out the courtyard and we'll we'll burn these to the Lord if you if you put your regular we're just going to some the Lord of these up but here's the thing if you think well Bob I didn't really think of anything I can't i'm not really sure what to put in there most of my message today is actually about giving you some ideas kind of like you know you ask somebody what do you want for christmas and they well well i'm gonna give you some ideas from the word of god what might be a good gift to give jesus so if you haven't written anything down you're still time and if you say well i put something in there you brought something else up that i didn't really think about tell you mention it that's okay you can put into won't hurt it at all because it's all going the same place so feel free even when i'm teaching you say you want me to get up and walk up yep won't disturb me at all i've had people literally drop downs right on the ground and I just kept preaching didn't even notice it won't bother me in the slightest I'll just keep on going because I tend to not notice things like that so no I don't notice when you fall asleep you don't have to come up and confess that to me confess that to the Lord and I forgive you because hey I understand but but please feel free to get up during the message if you'd like and put something in you know fold it up put it in the one of the two boxes so here in our text what I want to ask and I will hope to answer that question what do you give to the God who has everything it's true the Bible says the earth is the Lord's and the fullness thereof there's not a breath that you breathe that God didn't give you the Bible says God made man he breathe his nostrils the breath of life and he became a living being and when man finally takes his last breath the Bible says the Spirit ascends up to God and", "that's it so everything you are everything I am everything that you possess I mean every physical thing you have the clothes on your back the cars though whatever you drove to church today the jobs that we have the families we have even our children our spouses they're all gods the Bible says that he owns the cattle on a Thousand Hills that's what that him says and that comes from the Psalms he owns at all and someday he's going to reclaim it but he's inviting us to give him what we have or out of what we have now and so I do I want you to think about this being Jesus's birthday and what have you prepared for him most of us maybe we've already celebrated given all the gifts over we're trying to trying to relax now or maybe you're going to go do your gift opening after Christmas I want you to put this time aside today for his birthday if you will and if you would fill in the blanks that will help you to maybe think about this with me first principle is that seek the Lord but come to worship Him put in the word worship because in this text it's about worship these wise men came from the east but they're very clear why they came so look at the text first two verses now after Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judea in the days of Herod the King Magi from the east arrived in Jerusalem and here's why they came verse 2 they have a question where is he who has been born the King of the Jews we saw his star in the east and we have come this is why they made the trip to worship Him verse 11 tells us they did what they came to do they came into the house they fell to the ground and they worshiped him they did that by the way in the context of giving the gifts they did that actually before they gave the gifts but they came together worshiping has to do with giving it just does always does you know there's another group of men who we find not at the beginning of Jesus's ministry but at the end of his ministry when Jesus goes up to Jerusalem to be crucified and that Passover the feast it speaks to us about some Greek Jews who came up to the feast it's a very interesting passage if you want to jot it down it's John 12 verses 20 and 21 John 12 20 and 21 says now there were some Greeks among those who were", "going up to worship at the feast Passover these then came to Philip who was from Bethsaida of Galilee and they began to ask him saying sir we wish to see Jesus we wish to see Jesus I find it very interesting if you look at the rest of the context you you don't know for sure did they ever actually meet Jesus because the Bible doesn't tell us that they did they just told Philip who they knew knew Jesus we want to we want to see Jesus and then Philip does go to Jesus and he tells them and Jesus makes some comments but we don't read in the text that they actually ever connected with Jesus we just don't know two groups both coming to ultimately to worship and one for sure gets to see Jesus the other one a question mark we have the what I'll call the wiseguys of Matthew to who seek Jesus clearly in order to worship Him we know they see Jesus they meet Jesus and then you have what I'll call the Greek squad who come to worship Jehovah and since they're there they say they'd like to see Jesus but we don't know if they actually ever do the wise in the text ask nothing from the Lord he's a baby they asked nothing from him they only come to give to him Herod not this Herod the one that'll be alive later when Jesus starts his ministry will desire to see Jesus for a long time the Bible says he'll have heard about him the miracles he's performing and the healings that he's accomplishing and he wants to see Jesus for long time then finally when Pilate sends him to him he meets him but he's very disappointed when he meets Jesus you know why two things one Jesus doesn't do any miracle at all that's what he was hoping for and to Jesus stay silent he wants to meet and see Jesus but the reason he does was to get him to do something to entertain him or to prove who he was and jesus never speaks never does a miracle it's possible to be in in the very presence of Jesus and come away disappointed can't hear his word not speaking to you today not doing anything in your life because you're coming in unbelief jesus said of the multitudes who he had provided the fish in the lows for remember that miracle he said you seek me because you ate of the loaves and you were filled in other words you only seek me because you want something from me", "but God is something better than what I can give you I am the bread of life don't seek the bread that I could give you that bread you'll just perish if I give it to you it's a miracle that's true but there's something more than that and here's the idea the Lord has many things to give us there's no question about that he doesn't mind hearing our needs but he doesn't want you or me just to seek him for what he can give to us he wants us to seek him for what we can give to him because of who he is that's worship you say well I don't understand how does that apply what does that mean for me I want to look at the gifts that these three wise men brought to Jesus not just the gold frankincense and myrrh will get there but I want to look at some gifts that we can give to the Lord today so put this down give him the gifts of the wise that's verses two through 11 put in the word wide say Lord I want my kid you know that in Ecclesiastes it says when you come into the house of God don't there is such a thing the sacrifice of full is just speaking out I'm going to do that it means nothing don't bother so since I have that opportunity lord I want to give you a gift that's wise according to the scriptures jot down some one 16 and verse 12 psalm 116 verse 12 here's the question the psalmist asked and we need to ask what shall i render or give to the Lord word for all of his benefits to me what do I what should I give to God what do you give to the God who has everything well he goes on to say in that some i will take the cup of salvation and i'll call on the name of the Lord attention what shall I give to him here's what I'm gonna give to him I'll take something from him that's my gift what up yes I'll gift of salvation now to take the gift of salvation you have to admit that you needed you have to admit that you need forgiveness that means you have to identify yourself as a center means lord I have committed these sins I'm failing you in this area tell him that that's what he wants every sin that you and I commit he already paid for it is he owned it 2,000 years ago you say Lord I'm giving it to I'm repenting of it and", "I'm receiving your forgiveness I'll take the gift of salvation and I'll call on the name of the Lord that's what I'm gonna give what is that that's prayer that's faith god I'm going to turn from my sin because I need your salvation from it and number 2 i'm going to start trusting you in a fresh way i'm going to cry out to you for your help so what are you going to give the Lord maybe there's somebody this year maybe it's your spouse or a son or a daughter of mom and dad and you even asked him for a month what do you want for christmas yes over like that you always asking they'll I don't know just your love yeah right you know and don't get me anything this year yeah then you'll be grumpy about it later you know nobody gave me what do you want you bugged them and you bugged and they never told you anything you ever have something like that just don't know what to get them and so you finally I'll just give you some money go buy yourself a gift you know then you can blame yourself you don't like it and we like to get gift ideas I love it when my son's go here we go down here's the order on amazon just click there right there works good for me I mean it's nice if you know what somebody wants and can figure that out it's always better but if not it's nice to know what's in their heart so today like i said i hope to give you some gift ideas what would the Lord one and I want you to write it down even as I'm speaking you write it down maybe you wait and put two or three things down and then you come up when you're ready before we take it out to offer it by fire to the Lord there are three kinds of things I want to suggest that you might give him put it down on your outline something that needs to be repented of just talked about sin something that needs to be repented of something that you're doing that God is calling you to turn from and it's time to call it what it is not a not a tendency not a sickness not a problem not a fault or a failure a sin you're gonna say god it's in I'm too I've chosen to do these things that I know I should I'm gonna stop with your help but I'm asking you to forgive me for it", "today I'm done with it as far as I'm concerned you're going to help me to do it but I'm giving it to you number two there something that needs to be redeemed for something that needs to be repented of my sin then something that needs to be redeemed you say what's that something that is already yours that needs to become his something that you possess that you're going to give over to God maybe it's time you have time 365 days a year what do you do with marvins redeem the time days are evil what does that mean it means that I don't just hoard it to myself my time is mine what are you giving to God of your time on a daily basis on a weekly basis maybe we'll it will include something like your home your physical where you live your apartment in your house it's yours you live there you know that God told his people I want you to write your words I'm pardon me God said I want you to write my words on the doorpost of your house you saying pastor you telling us to go out and buy a mezuzah no I'm telling you that God wants his people to be clearly affiliated with his word so everybody in the neighborhood knows maybe you say I want my car my driving and what I do in my car to honor God need to redeem that it's I it's my car but I don't drive it as unto the Lord I'd be ashamed of a bumper sticker on there you know that said anything about Jesus maybe there's some maybe it's your job maybe it's your work a job maybe it's some gift that you have that you've really never dedicated to the Lord it's just yours and you use it for you and brings you on or some ability that you have you said you know I want to redeem that I want that to be yours you gave it to me but I'm giving it back so something you need to repent of something that it needs to be redeemed I think in the Bible you know we have things like Peters boat that he offered to Jesus first to preach from and then to be the guy in charge of where it was going to go or that little boy who gave Jesus is lunch to see what Lord might do with it or that baby donkey that was offered to Jesus for the ride into town because the Lord said tell them the Lord has need of", "it what is he asking you for what do you have then something you put in the word released something that needs to be repented of something that needs to be redeemed now something that needs to be released to the Lord he said what do you mean letting go of something maybe in your life that you do or a place you go or a person you know that is not good for you the dangerous place for you spiritually listen we all know who were comfortable around because they won't say anything when we sin we all have people that we can compromise with and maybe there's someone in your life Lords like I don't want you to be in that relationship I don't want you to go to that place anymore I want you to stop doing that it's hurting our relationship it tempts you it's a place of compromise and you know it and God saying it's time to release that to me I want that out of your life now some principles from the wise men put this down first of all give him give God a humble heart give him put in the word humble look at verse 2 they came to Jerusalem remember their wise men their wealthy men they're educated man we know that about them from history by the way there's a lot of things we think we know about them by the way we sing our songs that are just not true we and never calls him kings it never says there were three but now we're messing with tradition and tradition can be bigger than scripture don't let that happen by the way that's what happened in the catholic church tradition with a capital T becomes more powerful and potent than the scripture itself Jesus told the people of his day you've allowed your traditions to actually outweigh the scriptures and we can do it as evangelical Bible believing Christians do the way we perceive that you know oh there were three kings doesn't say that we don't know how many kings there were there could be ten Kings that each one gave gold frankincense and myrrh ego that really messes with my story what we just don't know exactly it's not so important otherwise Lord would have told us what is important is what they actually did do these Magi these wise men here's what it says they got to Jerusalem through their own understanding they're the only ones who seem to have it but the King of the Jews has been born just this small group of who three or however many two", "or more where is he who has been born King of the Jews we saw his star in the east we've come to worship Him so they come to the capital of Jerusalem that's the capital of Israel was then it will be again some day soon but here's my point they're wise enough to know that they don't know something they're humble enough to admit I don't know that and think about what this meant it meant they had to get as far as they had gone they have been traveling for a long time and they said you know we don't know where to go now where do we go from here we're going to have to stop have to kind of curb our camels and you know doc our donkeys order they did and walk in and ask somebody else strangers in this case for directions can you jot down proverbs 3 verses 5 and 6 listen proverbs 3 5 and 6 is one of the first scriptures you memorize as a Christian you know it's really humbling is when God brings this back to you after you've been a Christian for 5 10 20 30 40 years and says this is what you need to do trust in the Lord with all your heart and stop leaning on your own understanding in all your ways acknowledge him the word yada in here amines to know him to relate to him in all your ways acknowledge him and he will direct your path I'll give you guidance will make your paths straight I remember when the Lord was ministering to this me some years ago and I had been a pastor for years I had taught in this first many times I've given it out to many people I said god it's written on the bottom of the in and out cup I mean this is basic and here I'm not doing it and I had to admit Lord I'm I'm blowing it I'm not I'm leaving you out maybe what you need to do this christmas is just admit you've been making a lot of plans a lot of decisions maybe the reason you're not getting the wisdom of God is you're not even asking for it you're acting like you don't need it and maybe the way you're gonna get it isn't just by praying maybe you're going to need to do what the wise men did stop ask for someone else's counsel maybe listen ask for someone else's counsel who doesn't know as much as you know spiritually the people they're asking they baby aren't following the star are", "not seeking the Lord Jesus at all and maybe God's going to ask you to ask for some counsel in the area that you need help in from somebody else who frankly you're not impressed with but they have some information that you need that's pretty humbling so give him a humble heart maybe you'll write that down and put it in the bin put this down number to open your ears to God's Word why do I say that well how did the council come to look at verse for Herod gathering all the chief priests and the scribes of the people inquired of them where the Messiah was to be born hair doesn't know and they the scribe said them well that's in Bethlehem of Judea for this is what has been written by the prophet and he quotes Micah 52 and you bethlehem land of Judah are by no means least among the leaders of Judah you shall come forth a ruler who will be shepherd of my people Israel very interesting to me it is the word of God that's going to direct the Shepherd's a pardon me the wise men will be the Shepherd's two and the other story Luke but here it's going to be the Word of God that will get the wise men to where Jesus is the star could get them so far you know there's nothing wrong with the mindset that's as well I love to go out into nature and just be with the Lord I'd love to go into the mountains I love to go out and you know surfing or out on the beach or into the desert at the start I just can oh how I feel so close to God that's great the Bible says that heavens declare the glory of God and they do but can tell you something nature and creation will only get you so close to the Savior the star part of the creation could get them to Jerusalem but it'll take the scriptures to bring them to Bethlehem to Jesus it's always that way and they needed some direction from the scripture maybe in your life you don't really get direction from the Bible oh you honor the Bible you read the Bible you hear sermons on the Bible but your life has is never directed by the Bible you don't make decisions based on the Bible and maybe you're going to say Lord I want to have my ears open to your word what did Jesus say over and over again in Revelation let him who has ears to hear hear what the scripture the", "Spirit is saying to the churches put this down number three seek him more diligently in your life maybe that's what you want to say God I want this next year starting now to be a time of seeking you put in the word diligent or diligently look at verse 8 Herod sent them to Bethlehem the wise men and here's what he said to them go and search carefully for the child when you have found him reported to me so I too may come and worship Him listen at this this is amazing to me Herod claims he's excited about the King of the Jews the I being born he's obviously lying his only desire is to find him to kill him we all know that he's a total hypocrite but in spite of that the advice that he gives to the Wiseman is sound advice go and seek for him carefully why do I say that because God says so write it down Jeremiah chapter 29 verse 13 here's what God says you will seek me and you will find me when when you search for me with all of your heart Gus's I want to be found by you I want you to find me but I'm not going to let you find me if you just kind of half heartedly well you know i'm seeking the lord kind of with my life I really you know I'm mo know what that means but I hope God will bless my life and pray over my meals is it an interesting Herod isn't really seeking the lord at all you know it's possible to know the right thing to do even to be able to tell other people the right thing to do and still not actually do it yourself it's only six miles from Jerusalem to Bethlehem and Herod does not have the will or the time to get off his throne and go find him yeah you go find him for me nobody else can find Jesus for you nobody Magi had evidently been studying this star for two years how do I know that well you can deduct that you can deduce that from the fact that they tell her how long the star had been you can deduce that he kills the babies that are two years of agent under based on when the star appeared they had been studying carefully this phenomena whatever it was in the heavens for two years then they with 700 miles it's where they came from in Babylon took months they'd already been seeking him diligently and now he says now you're", "gonna have to get keep that up man go down to Bethlehem you're gonna have to look carefully but if you'll do that you'll find when you know what they were right maybe for you it means saying what I'm done with being a lukewarm casual Christian people of my work they don't even know that I'm a Christian people in my neighborhood have no clue cuz I keep my faith so private maybe it's because you're ashamed of your walk or maybe you just don't feel you have any power in your witness and maybe what the Lord is saying it's time to stop being a wimpy Christian and say Lord I want to live for you with all of my heart I want to be passionate for you will you help me to do that cuz I'm gonna start seeking you diligently whatever that means I want to do it maybe you've heard it before it convicts me every time I read it this was written by a young African pastor in Zimbabwe the night before he was arrested and executed it's part of a letter he wrote or a statement he wrote he said I'm part of the Fellowship of the unashamed the die has been cast I've stepped over the line the decision has been made I'm a disciple of his and I won't look back or let up slow down or back away or be still my past is redeemed my present it makes sense my future is secure I'm done and finished with low living site walking small planning smooth knees colorless dreams tamed visions mundane talking cheap living and dwarf goals my face is set my gate is fast my goal is heaven my road may be narrow my way rough my companions few but my guide is reliable and my mission is clear I will not be bought or compromised detour lured away turn back deluded or delayed I will not flinch in the face of sacrifice or hesitate in the presence of the adversary I will not negotiate at the table of the enemy or ponder at the pool of popularity or me in the maze of mediocrity I won't give up shut up or let up until I've stayed up stored up prayed up paid up and preached up for the cause of Christ I'm a disciple of Jesus I must give until I drop preach until all know and work until he comes and when he does come for his own he'll have no problem recognizing me because my colors will be clear maybe you can't and I can't be as eloquent as that God's not asking for", "your eloquence he's asking for your surrender he just wants you to say Lord I don't want to live a Christian life that's not honoring you Jesus you gave everything for me I haven't been giving everything for you but today I want to start seeking you diligently and put this down number four maybe your commitment will be to discover the Lord among his family discover him among his family why do I say that we'll look at verse 11 these Magi who are looking to find Jesus to worship Jesus to give themselves to Jesus in verse 11 says after coming into the house they saw the child that's him but notice he's with Mary his mother interesting parallel here between the magi and the Shepherd's the shepherds of course came the night he was born they were the only ones that really came to his original birthday party the first Christmas party and it's recorded in Luke 2 and verse 16 if you want to jot it down but don't miss it Luke 2 and verse 16 after the Angels told him where to go straight to Bethlem you'll find the child wrapped in swaddling clothes and lying in a manger they came with haste and then this is what it says so they came in a hurry they found their way to Mary and Joseph and the baby as he lay in the manger you say what's your point well don't miss it where are you going to find Jesus in both cases with his family of course you say well he was a baby you want to find a good shepherd John 10 you want to find the good shepherd you know where he'll be with the sheep with his sheep you want to find the vine dresser he'll be with the branches you want to find the bridegroom I'll be with the bride you want to seek Jesus and worship Jesus then you're going to find him with his family that's where he is where two or more gathered there am I in the midst maybe you're gifted Jesus maybe what you're going to write down on the blue card is Laura I'm going to stop trying to do this Christian life spiritually solo and maybe that's why I'm so often flying so low is because I just try to do with you and I don't know why I can't seem to connect with you very consistently say Lord I'm going to make a commitment to be with your people regularly but this down number five give him what's most precious to you of the word precious because in verse 11 when", "they find him with his family they fall to the ground they worship him but then they opened their treasures and they present to him gifts of gold and frankincense and myrrh so let's take these up they gave him they gave him gold obviously they gave him something very precious so put this down give him what God has already deposited in you give him what God has deep I cannot ask you to give him something you don't have but he is asking you to give him what's precious to you you know if you could take they tell us if you could take all the gold in the whole world that's ever been refined ever been mined out of the earth and you could put it all together in one place it would only be a block a solid block of gold that were sixty six feet by sixty six feet by sixty six feet that's all that would be what it would look like sitting on the field of be kind of hard to play tennis but that's how big it would be another one in relationship to the pyramid to show you its relative side the next slide them yeah all the gold in the whole world obviously precious because it's so rare so here's my question what is God given to you that's most precious to you if maybe it is your money by the way a said an interesting if you want to give money to the Lord how do you do it you give it to his family they didn't give it to G the gold wasn't given to Jesus for Jesus to manage he wouldn't been able to do that no I'm sure it financed their trip to Egypt and provided for them for the next few years you want to give to Lord some money give it to his family that's how you give it to him give it to the poor give it to the home get somebody in need Jesus will accept it that way but what's precious to you Abram offered up his only son most precious relationship he had who's that in your life have you dedicated that person your relationship with that person to the Lord to honor God in it you committed it Mary offered her spikenard remember she broke that alabaster vial and poured it out on Jesus people mocked her for it actually one of Jesus to reprimand her for it what a waste should we given to the board you know some commentators many commentators say what she was giving may well have been her dowry her chance of", "ever getting married that's what she gave is there something in your life that is so precious to you and Lord is saying would you trust me with that Joseph and Mary had to give up their they had to give up the way they wanted their life to go to have Jesus be in their life I'm sure there are plenty of big synagogue wedding with all their friends celebrating that's not what you do when you're pregnant and you're a Jewish woman 2,000 years ago they didn't even get to be home when the baby was born or have people understand why they were even getting married maybe there's something that you're needing to release to the Lord right now that has to do with what he's allowing in your life you don't like it you didn't picture it happening this way you've been frustrated angry at God or at people and God saying I want you to trust me dedicate that to me give that to me as your gift to me write it down this is my most precious thing Lord I'm giving it up to you right now it's all yours so there was gold then put this down for frankincense give him the tears that bring healing the tears that bring healing now frankincense grows on the boss whele tree and they slashed the tree and it actually bleeds out very interesting but when it bleeds out it forms these tears of resin and they harvest these tears which become extremely hard and then those are burned but they're also used for medicinal purposes as well in the ancient world for healing purposes maybe you're here and you're saying you know I'm going through something that has brought me such devastation some law some hurt something that's gone on and you need say Lord I want to dedicate this hurt in my life I want my tears to bring healing to somebody else god I want you to use which you've allowed that I have wept over or that I'm weeping over would you turn it into something that can bring an ability to make it through some comfort but and then there's mer put this down give him a love that is stronger than death mer is always associated in the Bible it seems like with a burial Nicodemus and Joseph of Arimathea it took about a hundred pounds of aloe and myrrh when they wrapped the body of Jesus it's used as an embalming but the idea is not an embalming inside the body like we involved but like the Egyptians on the outside and it was just", "frankly to preserve the body it allowed kind of a nose a deodorizer simply put give him put it down if you haven't already a love that is stronger than death I liked this idea by the way interesting thing about mer mer also is a resin that hardens but it has to be crushed in order to release the fragrance doesn't you don't just put it on like potpourri has to be burned or crushed otherwise there is no fragrance at all but here it's this gift you might say that's stronger than death I don't know how many of you this year are having a difficult time with Christmas because there's somebody in your life this is the first Christmas they're not there my receptionist bed for mom died about two weeks ago Pastor Mike just went home to be with the Lord friend of mine Bob Gasca and his brother had a sudden heart attack just about a week ago Sam there's a lot of people in this church who are missing people that they love maybe for you you're gonna say Lord I miss my husband I miss my wife I miss my mom or my dad I miss my son or my daughter or my friend but because your love for me Jesus was stronger than death my love for you is going to be stronger than death I'm gonna keep loving you you gave and you've taken away I will bless your name for who they are and refine though they are i'm going to celebrate where they are I can't wait to be with them again you offer your murn you offer your love to the Lord that is stronger the death write it down bring it up put it in the treasure chest what are you going to give to the Lord for Christmas for his birthday can I remind you of something that I thought about the other day whatever you and I give to the Lord think about it whatever gift you give to the Lord you actually give to yourself say what yeah you give him your sin you wind up having peace that it's forgiving and your guilt gone you give them the circumstances that are troubling you saying Lord I'm going to release those to you God will give you a piece that he's in charge he may not change it today but he's in charge and you can have peace without knowing what's gonna happen it's his gift you give him a gift he comes right back to you it's an amazing thing I gave my wife a dog ate 10 years ago now Oh Molly", "little dachshund you know the result of that I have a dog I didn't want a dog I go out with Molly you know to go through a drive through her just with me oh nice dog you have I was all mine it's my wife's no no it's kind of ours I know that when she has to go out potty in the middle of the night honey could you take the dog out that would be yours no I don't say that I just happy to that little boy that gave Jesus his lunch did he go hungry I don't think so I think he gave up his little lunch at had an all-you-can-eat buffet if I read the text correctly because everybody wound up glutted satisfied the word means to be it's Thanksgiving undo your belt know when you give to the Lord he'll never be your debtor when Peter let Jesus captain his boat that morning after the sermon was over did he take a loss that day in business oh no when he gave Jesus the rights to run the boat I think that day came out pretty good on the ledger if i remember right it seems like that was kind of like a banner day when it came to fish it gum why are we going to burn these things in just a couple of minutes fire you know did you know this that not only were sacrifices all offered to God by fire in the Old Testament whether a be burned that's the way it was conveyed to god but God also told his people when you go into the Promised Land don't hold on to the things that you that you see take the gold the silver the bronze and you bring that into my Treasury into my temple said you don't burn that you redeem that give it to me to use but everything else you burn it go back and read in Joshua when they took Jericho we all remember the walls came down but remember there was a man who saw spied King James as a Babylonian garment some other things that he wants changes of clothing various things and and he kept it and he was supposed to be was supposed to burn supposed to be dedicated the Lord by burning but he didn't burn it he kept it name was akin when the finger finally points to him through the lot and he has identified as the one who dishonored God's command caused the death of God's people in that next battle he is finally brought out and he's executed he's stoned to death", "by Israel by the nation and then he's burned it's very interesting to me it's kind of teaching us this principle if you hold on to that which God is saying to burn because it's dangerous and destructive for you in the end you're the one who will be burned by it because what do you want to give to Jesus you know Peter denied that he knew Jesus by a fire in a courtyard and it says he went out and he wept today I'm asking you to demonstrate that you know Jesus by a fire in a courtyard by what you're giving to him and I believe if you do you're going to go out and you're going to rejoice 62 times in the Bible what's offered the Lord is offered by fire sin dedication consecration prayers so three things and we'll go do it why are we going to use fire first of all put this down it refines what's precious fire refines what's precious gold silver they are actually refined in the fire they become more pure secondly it releases what's worthless when you take something that's precious or gold silver and you put it through fire actually what is not gold or silver comes out of it it burns away the dross and then finally it relocates what's earthbound when something is burned this is the picture of the incense that's burning in Jerusalem and it's wafting up to heaven this fragrant smell is a picture of the prayers of God's people God says I want you to picture it as ascending to me the called it his food it's like you're cooking him a meal and you're presenting it to him God saying it satisfies me because it's all a picture of Jesus you see on the cross the fire of God's wrath and holiness fell on the sacrifice Jesus Christ and God said it is acceptable to me if you're in Christ you are accepted in the beloved the Bible sets so I want you to finish up we're about to go put your gift in wrap it neatly no Bo necessary just fold it up and put it in what we're going to do now is I'm gonna have the ushers come they're going to collect those two boxes and they're going to if you don't mind let us go first we can get out to the fire pit out there and we want you to join us just come up we're going to worship and we'll conclude after they're burned in a brief prayer but go ahead and finish putting some stuff in if you want", "pour it out Lord we pray tonight that you would hear our prayer but it would be your spirit that is causing us to pray it Lord there are people that we love who are bound in deception in sin and it's been so long Lord we wonder if they're not going to just die there except that you set them free Lord we believe you because you've already set us free completely forever but now we want that for our children we want that for our friends we want that for the people we work with and in our families would you move would you pardon them Lord would you forgive them Lord we're ready to go to heaven you could take us out but they need to come to you so we ask that you would hear our prayer Lord inspired by your spirit to even pray as Jesus did Father

the app and everything we've said is right there with more information and if it's a sign up it'll help you to do that all right let's get into the word I want you to open your Bibles now to Numbers Chapter beginning in verse 1. now the Lord spoke to Moses saying speak to the sons of Israel say to them when you enter the land where you are to live which I am giving fulfill a special vow or as a free will make a soothing Aroma to the Lord from the herd or from the flock one tenth of anifa a fine flower mixed with one-fourth of a hin of oil and you shall prepare wine for the drink or for a ram you shall prepare as a", "fine flower mixed with one-third of a you shall offer one-third of a hint of wine as a soothing aroma to the Lord when you prepare a bowl as a the Lord then you shall offer with the an IFA a fine flower mixed with one half of a hint of oil and you shall offer as soothing Aroma to the Lord thus it shall be done for each ox for each Ram or for each of the male limbs or of the goats according to the number that you prepare so you shall do for everyone according to their number all who are native shall do these things in this manner by fire as a soothing aroma to the Lord father open our eyes open our hearts God give us a will to listen and to yield to what your spirit would say to us we love worshiping you but we want to do it according to your word we want to honor you in the way that we live not just the way we talk at church or feel a church but Lord in the way we act and react to real circumstances and and even when we blow it and fail we need your help so Lord teach us tonight how to let your word teach us how to live for you in Jesus name amen you can well I've entitled the chapter we'll see how far we can get I'm hoping to go through the whole chapter but we'll see um how God's word works I suppose you could probably put that title just by any chapter of the Bible that would work but um here God is speaking uh to Moses on behalf of the people of Israel and if you just started reading in chapter 15 remember there were no chapter and verse divisions when the Bible was created it wasn't like Moses wrote chapter 14 and then he felt wait a minute the spirit of God is telling take a break start a new chat wasn't like that those were all chapter divisions and verse divisions were all added hundreds of years later in fact after Christ way after Christ and I heard somebody describe the guy added them they said he did that while he was on a on a journey on a on a donkey uh throughout the his travels and somebody said yeah he would go over a bump and go oh let's put one there let's put it because sometimes it doesn't make any sense why there's a break in the passage that seems to be done more out", "um and in this case I I just want to say the way we study when we go chapter by chapter is fine except for this we tend to completely divorce ourselves from everything we just read and like it has nothing to do with it and that's just not the case um and the reason I say that is we need to remember the context of where we are children of Israel if you weren't with us or it's been a whole weekend you just just were told to go into the promised land they member sent in spies ten in the spies came back with the evil report saying there's Giants in the land there's fortified cities and we saw all these horrible people and there's no way if we go in there they will kill our wives and our children we'll never be able to take the land and so they uh discourage the people of God Joshua and Caleb who had a different spirit said we can do it they'll be our bread let's go for it and they said let's kill you the 10 spy said let's kill these other two and let's let's go back to Egypt let's get a new leader Moses isn't our leader anymore we're going to go back to Egypt and so that's when Moses had to intercede because God said I'm going to wipe them out like we were just talking about and so Moses intercedes and basically God tells them you're going to take him back Remember by the way of the Red Sea out back into the Wilderness and as I mentioned last time this is the beginning it's actually not a total of 40 years but it's about 38 more years that they're going to have to be in the wilderness which is for a whole lot of them the rest of their lives in fact God is waiting for everybody to die who was 20 years of age and older so that he could bring the ones that they said would die into the promised land safely it's very interesting he said God's saying basically you thought your kids would die they're the ones who will do what you should have done they'll inherit the promised land but you're all going to die in the wilderness this is your the consequence of your unbelief it'll affect you the rest of your life now the reason it's important to understand that is then what happened we did study this then when Israel had heard this they said oh man we've sinned okay you know what we've thought about it we're not going", "back to Egypt we're going into the and Moses said don't do that God said you're not going and oh yeah we'll do it now and so they go in and they get beaten badly about 100 miles they're chased up to the northern part of Israel and I'm sure they finally came back but the bottom line is this is a very very low point for the nation of Israel they have God's sentence upon them basically a death sentence for the rest of Life he's not abandoning them he's not saying you're going to hell he's saying now there's a consequence for your unbelief and it will affect you and it will affect your families uh and so what I want you to see in the midst of that is what he's saying in chapter 15 seems completely unrelated to what just happened but it is put this down God's word uplifts us when we fail and then after you put in the word uplifts and fail put this down our faithlessness does not diminish God's verse one now the Lord spoke to us right at this moment when they're being sent back into the Wilderness and he says this in verse 2 when you enter the land not if you ever enter the land and that's encouraging if you think about it even though they have to go the next 38 years in the wilderness it's not forever God just shut the door on the Promised Land uh and it'll be closed for the next well 40 years 38 years but not forever and I think it's important to see that right here listen here's the principle for you and me God's people that's who we are we can delay God's blessings on we do it all the time actually but we cannot destroy his purposes his ultimate purposes and Destiny for our life now we're not surprised by the failing of Israel any more than we're surprised when when we fail but the amazing thing in here is not the failing of Israel he said well that had God's presence with them he had saved them from Egypt I'm shocked that they didn't believe God really do we have less evidence with the Holy Spirit living inside of us the completed word of God Jesus Christ fulfilling all the promises of God and predictions we actually have more Revelations you know when Jesus came to this earth he did his ministry in Jerusalem or in Galilee which one mostly Galilee what was his headquarters Capernaum Capernaum and interesting thing what Jesus says at some point in his ministry he says", "to the cities that he had done most of his miracles in woe to you betseta woe to you corazim do you think you'll be lifted up to heaven you won't be you'll be brought down to Hell because if Tire inside whom God had judged in the Old Testament had seen the Miracles that I did in you they would have remained till this day but instead they were destroyed in other words you guys got what other people never got Capernaum the headquarters of where Jesus lived that was Peter's house where Jesus lived and did his ministry up there in Galilee he said you guys are going to be more responsible if Sodom had seen what you Sodom would have repented instead of being destroyed during the days a lot in other words what's amazing is is not people's failure to believe that comes just to us very natural what's amazing is the grace and the mercy of God that his purposes are not overwhelmed by our sin you can delay God's blessing in your life for 40 minutes for 40 hours for 40 days or 40 years but you cannot ever diminish his purpose and Isaiah God said my counsel shall stand and I will do all my pleasure Solomon said there are many devices in a man's heart nevertheless the counsel of the Lord will stand David said the counsel of the Lord stands forever the thoughts of his heart are for all generations and Isaiah said the Lord of hosts hath purpose who shall disannull it and all I can say to that is Lord thank you that my worst unbelief will never diminish your commitment to me though we are faithless faithful because he can't deny himself put this down number two God's word gives us hope for the future that's what's happening here you got to realize as I said last time though they they began the longest funeral March you're going to die in the wilderness that's where you're going but God's not saying I'm not going with you I'm not going to provide for you or I'm done with you but he's giving them hope for the future jot down Romans 15 and verse 4. here's what Paul says whatever was written in earlier times what's he talking about the Bible his Old Testament what we call our Old Testament that was what he's referring to whatever was written like numbers in earlier times was written for our instruction that through perseverance and the encouragement of the scriptures we might God's word comes to give us hope it's been said a person can live 40", "days without food some of us would say oh I couldn't Jesus did you can live about 40 days without food about a week without water around five minutes without air for you brain damage or die can't live much more than a second if you lose all hope if you feel there is no hope you're that's when people start thinking about taking their life jot down Romans 15 and verse 13. now may the god of Hope fill you with all joy and peace and believing that you may abound in Hope by the power of the Holy I heard a story years ago of a little boy they didn't know what was wrong with him but he was getting sicker and so he was finally hospitalized and it became pretty apparent to everybody he's not going to make it he was going to die weaker and weaker and they couldn't figure out what was going on inside his body but at some point because he wasn't dead yet some decision was made they might as well occupy his time so they sent a teacher in he was a kid he was like a kindergarten age and they the teacher came in and started spending time with the little boy and teaching him teaching him his alphabet explaining to him how to put words together and all and the most incredible thing happened this little boy's Health completely turned around it's all that happened no medicine no surgeries no diagnosis he just got better and better and when they actually wound up talking to this little boy saying what happened it seemed like everything changed when the teacher came in he said well I figured they wouldn't send a teacher to tell a dying boy his letters and teach him his letters if he was dying so it was just hope that this little boy had you know it was David who said if I had not believed I would see the goodness of the Lord and the land of the living I would have despaired and Satan wants you to think that God's done with you when you blow it that there is no redeeming you the consequences that he's given you is just his way of saying I'm through with you jot down Jeremiah 29 11 and now don't just jot it down believe it God says for I know the plans I have for you declares the Lord plans for welfare not to be on welfare for your welfare and not for Calamity but to give you a future and a whole put this down number three faith-filled worship draws others to worship too put", "in the word draws and look at verses 14 through 16 now if an alien non-jew sojourns with you or one who may be among you throughout your generations fire as a soothing Aroma to the Lord just as you do Deuce just as you do so he shall do in other words he's to do the same thing you do verse 15. as for the assembly there shall be one statute one law for you and for the alien who sojourn's with you a Perpetual statue throughout your Generations as you are so shall the alien be before the Lord there's to be one ordinance for you and for the alien whose sojourns among you very interesting first of all let's just for a moment go back you say well these people are all told they're going to die in the wilderness that must have been miserable yes but don't miss what God is saying to them about their children for some of us in this room who've experienced a glorious salvation in the Lord and your kids really their only knowledge of the Salvation of God is your testimony what you tell them now I know that there were people under 20 who came out of Egypt but they were with Mom and Dad they're along for the ride basically they're experiencing now in the wilderness because their mom and dads have are not believed but at least for a moment let yourself think about this do you think it might have been an encouragement to those parents to be told you know what your children are going to go into the promised land no you're not you're going to die out here but they will I think for most of us we come to a point where we say Lord would you bring my kids at least as far along as I've gotten or better yet can you imagine Lord bring them further than I've ever gotten spiritually would you pray for that if you could would you say Lord I want them to know you as well or better than I ever have I want your blessing to be on my kids you know that's in a sense you got to see that in the text God's saying your children are going to go in and they're going to experience by faith beyond what you were able to experience would you be grateful for that if God would speak that to you tonight about one or two or all of your children that they're going to have that blessing instead of it's just all about me and what I'm not going to get you see it's", "very interesting to me but faith-filled worship draws others to worship too God says if you have a non-jew who's never been saved through you know the experiences that you've had but they see you worship and they want to worship me because they see the way you worship you're going to do let them do that I think of the story in the Book of Ruth it's interesting that's called The Book of Ruth and not the book of Naomi but you remember Naomi's a Jew comes from Bethlehem goes to with her husband elimelech to Moab and while they're there her husband dies and and Ruth her daughter-in-law her husband dies so actually two of of Naomi's Sons die and her husband it's a horrible sad thing she changes her name to Bitter Miss bitter literally that's what Mara means just call me bitter her name was meant pleasant pleasant one she says don't call me Pleasant the Lord she blames God the Lord is dealt bitterly with me I came in full and now I'm going to go out empty and I'm broke and I've got no hope I got no future I got and uh and she tells her daughter's in love you know you don't want to go with me because moabite women are not going to be you know they're not like there's not a dating service in Israel for moabite women because they're cursed to the X Generation they're not allowed into the congregation of the lord they're God's enemies you want to stay here find yourself a husband I can't help I got no money and no more sons and and you remember the story how the one or the one daughter-in-law uh said you're right you know orpa says peace out you know I'll see you later mom nice knowing you and then Ruth clung to her just clung to her do you remember what don't send me away from following after for where you go what I will go where you Lodge that's where I'm standing too your people will be my people and your God will be my God even in Naomi's unbelief she wasn't exactly a sterling witness the Lord is down bitterly with me call I want to know your God I don't know that I want to know you but I want to know your God you still believe in God you're going back to Bethlehem trust in the Lord as best you can and Ruth says I want that that's the way it ought to be Isaiah 60 and verse 3. God said this to his people and Nations", "the goaim the the um the people's non-jews will come to your light Israel and Kings to the brightness of your Rising First Corinthians 14 verses 24 and 25 has an application to Paul says if the church gathers and everybody speaks in tongues and some unbeliever or Ungifted person comes in and they hear you all talking gibberish or talking in other languages at the same time they'll say you're crazy but if everybody on the other hand is being led by the Lord to speak a word that's what it means to prophesy if you're Spirit Led and speaking out God's word to one another if all were to prophesy and a non-believer or a non-gifted man enters that person will be convicted by all why because God's speaking through you truth and they'll be called to account by everything they hear the secrets of their heart will be disclosed and they'll fall on their face they will worship God declaring God is certainly the Lord desires not just to use the sermon and the worship you know he wants to use his people being led of the spirit of God to speak the word of God when we're together in such a way that people know that God is here and they are drawn to know your God put this down put God first and start with your dough put in the word first and do why do I say it verse 17 and following then the Lord spoke to Moses saying speak to the sons of Israel say to them when you enter the land where I bring you not if then it shall be that when you eat of the food of the land you shall lift up your doe you shall lift up a cake as an so you shall lift it up from the first of your dough you shall give to the Lord really this is kind of the Old Testament version of Matthew 6 33 which you already know seek ye first the kingdom of God and his righteousness and Jesus said all the things that we tend to worry about what shall I eat what shall I drink what shall I put you know all the things that the world cares about that we can get into worrying about too all those things will be added to you just keep the main thing the main thing seek first the kingdom what's my priority Lord how do I honor you in this situation my flesh is always thinking about me and my problems in my family and what can I do and how can I work at", "all leaning on my own understanding God says you know just stop it seek first the kid put me first and and I'll take care of the rest you know there's all these great examples from history the question is are our lives going to be an example to our children or to anybody else listen this RG Letourneau a wealthy Christian industrialist who made Earth moving was once asked how if he was giving 90 of all of his income away which he was was he still continuing to get richer he lived on 10 percent gave away 90. he said well I shovel it out and God shovels it in and he's using a bigger that was his testimony listen to this John D Rockefeller at the age of 33 was a millionaire a millionaire today is like who wants to be uh that doesn't mean anything I mean you know now it's a billionaire right I forget how many billionaires well Biden was talking about how many billionaires we have in his speech John D Rockefeller 33 when not too many people were millionaires was a millionaire at 53 he was the first billionaire on the Earth by the way richest man on earth by then however he was but a shell of a man he had alopecia he looked like a mummy his income was a million dollars a week he could buy anything he wanted but he can only digest milk and crackers an associate of his wrote quote he could he would not smile and nothing in life meant anything to him the richest man on the earth he was immersed in anxiety he was a wreck his personal highly skilled Physicians predicted he would die within one year many newspapers already had his obituary on file ready for his imminent demise and the year past agonizingly slow in which he was to die as he approached death he awoke one morning with the vague remembrances of a dream he could barely recall the dream but he knew it had something to do with not being able to take any of his successes with him into the next world the man who could control the business World suddenly realized he was not in control of his own life he was left with a choice he called his attorneys his accountants and managers and announced he wanted to channel his assets to hospitals research and Mission so on that day Rockefeller established his foundation his focus of Interest turned from inward to outward he became interested in the underprivileged he provided vast sums for medical research his contributions aided in the discovery of penicillin", "cures for current strains at the time of malaria tuberculosis and diphtheria but the most amazing part of rockefeller's story is that the moment he began to give back a portion of all that he had earned his body's chemistry was altered so significantly he got better it looked as if he would die at 53 he lived to be 98. and I Think Jesus put it this way it's than to receive and so the Lord says I seek me first with your dope literally in the text you know what you do with your money how the somebody has said you give me your bank book whatever that is your cell phone now give me give me your bank book and your calendar your personal calendar and I'll tell you what I'll tell you what's most important to and and it might be just saving it all for yourself but do you do that do you give God of the first fruits of what he's given to you I can tell you you don't want to wait till the end of your life to figure out what you should have done because you can't go back and do it again you have the privilege right now I've decided I want to be living proof of what the Bible says in Malachi bring the whole time then the storehouse God says test me now in this it's interesting God who says Thou shalt not Test the Lord in this one instance says test me in this if I won't open the windows of heaven and pour out a blessing that cannot be and there's a lot of us in this room can testify this isn't about raising money for the church this is about you saying God I want to honor you with the first fruits of what you've given to me because you've commanded to me it's yours here's what the Lord says if God can't trust you with material things who's going to give you Eternal this don't you understand it's all a test all the money is a test it's just Monopoly money it's good you said well it doesn't look like give me your Monopoly money it's it's not the real deal it will be as worthless as your Monopoly buddy is when the game is over it's worthless it was worthless the whole time actually it's not that money is something we need God knows we need it the question is do you trust him to provide for you what the one who promised my God shall supply all your needs now your greeds give us this day our daily bread not our", "daily filet mignon but if you have never tested God in that I challenge you tonight say Lord this is a hard area for me but I don't want it I don't want to be something I just hear stories about others I want to be one that's living it out so that I can be of encouragement to others but really so I can see your blessing on me as well we'll put this down God's word tells us how to deal with disobedience in verses 22-36 put in the word deal and then first of all after that put in the word of straight we're instructed how to be forgiven when we go astray in verses 22 through 29 but verse 22 when you unwittingly fail and do not observe all these Commandments which the Lord has spoken to Moses even all that the Lord has commanded you through Moses from the day when the lord gave commandment and onward throughout your Generations then it shall be if it is done unintentionally without the knowledge of the congregation that all the congregation shall offer one bowl ordinance and one male goat for a sin verse 25 then the priest shall make atonement for all the congregation of the sons of Israel and they will be forgiven for it was an error and they by fire to the Lord and their sin so all the congregation and the sons of Israel will be forgiven with the alien who sojourns among them for it happened to all the people through error also if one person sins unintentionally then he shall offer a one-year-old female goat for a sin before the Lord for the person who goes astray when he sins unintentionally making atonement for him that he may be forgiven you shall have one law for him who does anything unintentionally for him who is a native among the sons of Israel and for the alien who sojourns so through God's word God's people are told how to handle it when they fail now this particular text deals with what is commonly called the sins of omission there are Commandments that are telling us that there are sins of commission things we do and sins of vote Mission I remember hearing a story of a Sunday school teacher that was asking her class if they knew what that was you know what are the sins of omission and a little girl says uh why aren't those the sins we should have committed but didn't no basically it's when we fail see the Bible says um sin is missing the mark that's what the", "word hamartia in the Greek means to miss the mark and we are called to live out a perfect life which we know we can't do it's impossible for us to live a perfect life even as Christians we're still going to sin but with a sin nature before we know the Lord that's we live in our sin it's kind of like the water of the fish that just has always lived that way it's our nature to sin but when we come to the Lord he gives us a new nature and the power of the Holy Spirit and the knowledge of the word of God to strengthen us to walk after the Lord so in any particular case I don't have to sin I choose to sin and even Christians can become addicted to things and in bondage to sin so the Lord is teaching us through his word there will be times when we will fail to honor him we'll fail to live up to his standards we'll miss the mark and so to know what to do Lord how do I get right with you and just failing to do what God has required is just as much sin as doing something that God has told us not to do now we all fail as I just said to obey all of God's Commandments remember that James brings this subject up because our tendency is to say well I'm not that big of a sinner you know I mean I'm not as big of a sinner as you or her or him or whatever we kind of compare ourselves but James says this if you break one of God's laws any one of them you can choose which one what does that make you well it makes you a law breaker right I always try to remind people go back to the Garden what was it that brought death to the entire universe was it murder no it wasn't what came into Abel what what was the sin Disobedience just not eating from the tree okay let's be clear any sin has the same consequence no matter how severe it seems to us the wages of sin any sin is the same it breaks our fellowship with God it is worthy of Eternal death that's hard for us to understand because we we think differently God doesn't grade on it's been steady grades on the cross he said well but Lord I'm a nice guy most of the time I mean I lost my temper once see can you imagine somebody going up before a judge saying your honor", "I have been in a thousand Banks I never robbed them tell that one time that is no defense to whether or not you're a bank robber right so we've got to keep our mind it's not about your relative goodness it's sin has a consequence but I like the fact that it says we've gone astray Isaiah 53 verse 6. familiar to us all of us like sheep have gone well astray each of us has turned to his own way but the Lord is laid on him the iniquity of assault here's what the scripture teaches Old and New Testament sinning Saints are straying sheep first Peter 2 and verse 25 but you were continually straying like sheep but now you Believers have returned to the shepherd and the guardian of your souls and you know just because we're Believers doesn't mean that we're not going to have times where we still go um some of you know the song Come Thou Fount of Every Blessing words are these Come Thou Fount of Every Blessing tune my heart to sing thy Grace streams of Mercy never ceasing call for songs of loudest praise teach me some melodious sonnet Etc but then there's this line prone to wander Lord I feel it prone to leave the God I love here's my heart oh take and seal it seal it for thy quartz above those words were written by a man named Robert Robinson interesting life let me tell you a little bit about Robert who wrote that hymn years ago his dad died when he was a small child in 18th century England there was little in the way of social welfare system and this meant that he had to go to work while still very very young without a father to guide him he fell in with bad companions one day his gang of rowdies harassed a drunken Gypsy pouring liquor into her they demanded she tell their fortunes for free pointing her finger at Robert she told them he would live to see his children and grandchildren this struck a tender spot in his heart he thought to himself if I'm going to live to see my children and my grandchildren I'll have to change my ways of living I can't keep on living like I'm living now is that interesting at the age of 20 he made peace with God and he immediately set out to become a Methodist preacher himself two years later in 1757 he wrote A Hymn which expressed his joy in his new Faith it's Come Thou found the famous hymns though seemed almost self-profizing the light of his latter", "years it is said that while traveling and a stagecoach a lady began singing that hymn she didn't know who he was she struck by struck up a conversation with Robert not realizing he was the author of the hymn Robinson tried to change the subject he was backslidden but the lady persisted frustrated Robinson Cried Out Madam I am the unhappy man who wrote that hymn many years ago and I would give a thousand worlds if I had them if I could feel now as I felt them well she said you know the streams of Mercy are still flowing and that was the day he got right with the Lord he came back to the Lord he needed to he didn't do what that him said and I do think there are some of you here maybe and you feel like I've been far from God and I don't think I could ever be close to him again you know I think that's the worst thing when we're believers and we're living in the flesh when we're living in compromise we are not happy really in our com isn't that true when you get saved it's like you're not really happy in the Lord you're not living for the Lord and maybe you really want to be still out doing your fleshly stuff but then you're really not happy in the world the way you used to be you can't be inside it's like I really hate this and I hate it over it's like you feel like Dr Jekyll missed or Hyde and you're just messed up you'll never be happy in compromise as a Christian it'll be the sense of hating life and so the call of God is get right with him he has made provision for the person who has gone astray and it maybe it's you tonight to say I need to get right with the Lord I need to come to him I just come to church but come back to the Lord put this down willful Defiance on the other hand isn't forgiven but it must be punished willful Defiance must be punished look at verse 30 through 36 but the person who does defiantly by the way this word defiantly in Hebrew literally means in the Hebrew with a high hand and the idea is doing it like this to God shaking a fist to God like do whatever you want to do God the person who does anything defiantly whether he is a native or an alien that one is blaspheming the Lord and that person shall be cut off from among his", "because he has despised the word of the Lord and has broken his Commandment that person shall be completely cut off and his guilt will be on him verse 32 now while the sons of Israel were in the wilderness they found a man Gathering wood on the Sabbath day those who found him Gathering wood brought him to Moses and Aaron and to all the congregation and they put him in custody it's about the only time I can remember reading in the Bible anybody got put in jail they didn't really have jails and they put him in custody because it had not been declared what should be done to him they didn't know what God wanted to be done with them then the Lord said to Moses The man shall surely be put to death all the congregation shall Stone him with stones outside the camp so all the congregation brought him outside the camp and stoned him to death with stones just as the Lord had commanded Moses now this illustration is used to illustrate what God had just said a person who knows the right thing to do and says I don't care I don't care what God says I don't care what God's word says I'm going to do what I want to do when a person defies God's will they despise God's word I I agree with that statement I sometimes will write it in people's Bibles and I have written in a number of Minds this book will keep you from sin or sin will keep you from this the word of God is to give us instruction how to avoid sin and how to remedy sin when we fall into it it teaches us how to confess our sins it teaches us how then to avoid Temptation it teaches us how to encourage our faith so we can resist the devil so that he might flee from us did you notice the word of used in here blasphemy remember the unforgivable sin that Jesus mentions in the New Testament what is it the blasphemy of the Holy Spirit the unforgivable said now I get this question asked me a lot well Pastor Bob you know somebody said that they you know cussed God out and so they've they've they are sure they can't be forgiven or uh somebody has you know committed suicide so that person clearly can't go to heaven because there's no getting right with God they've already died in in their sin the blasphemy of the Holy Spirit is none of those the blasphemy of the holy spirit is actually technically speaking against but it's having a heart", "that's denying what the holy spirit's message is the spirit of God Jesus said comes when he comes he will glorify me the spirit of God is always pointing at Jesus he's the answer Jesus said all manner of sin will be forgiven including sin that's been committed against me he said but the blasphemy against the resistance the rejection the willful rejection of what the spirit of God is saying which is go to Jesus come to Jesus and say no no a thousand times no I won't I don't have to the person who rejects the work of the holy spirit in their life to they need to come to Christ there is no forgiveness outside of Christ that's what he's saying it's not something that you do it's a willful denying that Christ is the answer and refusing to come to him there's salvation in no one else the Bible says the German poet named Hina said this on his deathbed quote of course God will forgive me that's his job of course God will forgive me that's his I agree with the statement about him he understood neither the awfulness of sin or the high cost of Grace that person who thinks that God is obligated to forgive you without repentance the Bible doesn't teach that jot down Hebrews 10 verses 26-29 some of the harder verses in the New Testament if we go on sinning willfully after receiving the knowledge of the truth there no longer remains a sacrifice for sins but a certain terrifying expectation of judgment and the fury of a fire which will consume the adversaries anyone who has set aside the law of Moses dies without Mercy on the testimony of two or three Witnesses like in this case they saw this guy Gathering wood on the Sabbath how much severe punishment do you think he will deserve who has trampled underfoot the Son of God and has regarded as unclean the blood of the Covenant by which he was Sanctified and has insulted the spirit of Grace that's referring I believe to the blasphemy the Holy Spirit there is no come yet when you reject the work of Christ you're in trouble Romans 2 and verse 5 Paul talking about sinning after we know the truth but because of your stubbornness and unrepentant heart you are storing up wrath for yourself in the day of Wrath and the revelation of the righteous Judgment of God so we see in the text God's word tells us how to deal with our Disobedience we need to get right with the Lord he you know God's", "um when it comes to the the Lord describing Sinners uh Jesus would see the multitudes and he saw them as sheep without a Shepherd says he felt compassion for them okay and Jesus would say he who commits a sin is a slave to sin so he sees the average Rank and file sinner as not somebody who's willfully against God but somebody who is like a sheep who's frankly just well I'll say dumb but out of the way just lost just lost deceived and he has compassion on that person a lot of times we don't have compassion on people uh who Jesus would have compassion on um we're ready you know God will judge him but he just he the Bible says this if any man is caught in a trespass You Are Spiritual restore such a one in the spirit of gentleness that's Galatians 6. if anyone is caught and trusted that's an interesting statement the reason it's interesting is the word caught the picture is of of kind of like putting your foot into a bear trap okay if you're caught in a trespass because the word trespass by definition is not oh I stumbled into sin it is where's the line I'm doing it but the Bible describes a person who's caught in their trespass as somebody who needs to be restored and have mercy on him it's like ah let him get they've walked over the line it's extremely compassionate and merciful to describe somebody who's caught in their sin as though they didn't have any responsibility for it but God is merciful to people who get themselves into a world of hurt and maybe you're in a world of hurt you've made some really bad decisions and you feel like I kind of feel like I was well are you rejecting the work of Christ to forgive you are you rejecting what the holy spirit is saying to you that you need to humble yourself confess your sin and get right with the Lord because if you're willing to come he's willing to clean you tonight and I love that about the Lord he's so gracious put this down God's word calls us to remember God's word God's word calls us to remember God's the Lord also spoke to Moses saying speak to the sons of Israel tell them that they shall make for themselves tassels on the corners of their garments throughout their generations and they shall put on the tassels of each Corner a cord of blue it shall be a tassel for you to look at and remember all the Commandments of the Lord so as to do", "them and not follow after your own heart and your own eyes which you have played verse 40. so that you may remember to do you might want to Circle it all my Commandments and be holy to your so the first thing I take away from this is well then don't fall into selective here's a go I remember my wife and my three sons were in the car and uh Becky said did you hear what what he said and I said what she said did you hear what he said I said who she said it was one of my sons I remember which one but he was saying something but man and I I didn't really and she said you know I've noticed you I think maybe you're having she thought maybe because I was a police officer and at the range I maybe had damaged my eardrums which is possible so she said I've noticed you don't respond a lot of times so she said I think you need to get your ears you know your hearing tested I thought oh man that'd be a bummer but okay so I set up an acoustic test they took me in the guy did all this stuff you know put up the little thing when I heard and man I passed it like great I was really happy but how come my wife says that when sometimes she's talking to me or and he looked at me like uh it's called selective hearing is what we I say you're saying can you can you can you tell her something else these tassels were to remind them not just to remember the word but to remember to obey all of it all of it someone said we need to go back a lot of us Bible loving Christians go back and read the parts of our Bible we did remember what Jesus said to the Pharisees he says you guys tied the the mint the dill and the cumin those are those little garden herbs that they would grow at their homes and they tithe everything to the Lord I mean if they got a sesame seed bun they'd be picking up ten percent they gave ten percent of everything to the Lord he says but you have neglected listen to this the weightier matters of the law in other words you've decided to measure Yourself by certain aspects of obedience but not everything God said and you know what we can all do that we can become very judgmental of certain people that do things that we don't do I've learned not to do that", "maybe it's you know we're speeding and and or you know they're speeding and we don't do that anymore or ever or maybe we don't go to a movie and they tell us they went to a movie and it's you know where they tell us they watch TV and you have one of those Satan things in your home do you know he's the god of the prince of the power of the air the airwaves whatever I mean we can become very very judgmental but it's interesting Jesus said don't just pick and choose and then measure Yourself by yourself don't fall into selective obedience and number two biblical Faith produces an obvious well Fringe lifestyle he says I want you my people all of you to have these tassels of blue these fringes on your garments God commands us to be holy that doesn't mean to be odd but it does mean to be different that sitsit which is what that's called represented their relationship to God wasn't just a relationship to the Commandments but their relationship to God and how to honor him by obeying his Commandments sometimes I think Christians fall into this trap of thinking well you know faith is a very private thing so I don't talk about it with other people because I don't want anybody to feel uncomfortable well it's interesting to me because that's completely contrary to the scripture their faith was to be as obvious as the garments that they were they had distinctive garments that spoke of their relationship with with their God put this down our faith is to be tangible enough for others to grasp put in the word grasp and jot down Zechariah 8 and verse 23. thus says the Lord of hosts in those days talking about the future now in the thus says the Lord of hosts in those days ten men from all the nations will grasp the Garment literally that's itsy this these horn tassels of the Jews saying let us go with you for we have heard that God is with you interesting Something's Gonna they're gonna lay hold of that which speaks of their relationship with God saying we want that same relationship and our faith is to be something other people can see lived out in our life think of the woman with that Hemorrhage remember that said if I just touch the Lord's hem it wasn't the Hem of His Garment like you think of a hem it's talking about the tsitsi it's talking about these she said if I just lay hold of that if I just and the word touch doesn't mean she", "touched it either it means to hold on to she grasped it and it was that that the Lord chose to heal her through it's very interesting but our faith is to be tangible enough for others to grasp and then number four remember God's word so you can obey it not just so you can show off that you know it or Deuteronomy 22 and verse 12 you shall make yourself tassels on the four corners of your garment with which you cover yourself God said to his people this is something he repeats again then 38 years later before they're going into the promised land in the second giving of the law he says it again it's interesting because in Deuteronomy 6 remember that's a very important passage well they're all important but it's just uniquely important it's called the is a word in Hebrew that means listen here h-e-a-r here o Israel Israel Adonai hello The Lord Is Our God the Lord is the Lord is one and you shall love the Lord your God with all your heart soul mind and strength and these words which I'm commanding you today shall be on your heart God says and then you're going to speak of them when they're on your heart you're going to speak of them when you rise up when you lie down every aspect of your life to your children you're going to teach your kids diligently because they're on your heart so God commands those people in that passage my word is to be on your heart by the way it's also to be tied to your hand it's also to be on your head and it's to be on your house on the doorpost of your house mezuzahs that's a obedience there they're putting the word of God on their house it is very obvious where a Jew lives even today in Israel because the word of God is on their house literally and the Orthodox still were full actors they still wear those boxes leather boxes on their arms and on their but God says I want my word to be remembered I want you to be constantly reminding yourself of what my word says and someone how blessed is the man or who meditates in God's law day and night where to marinate in God's word which is like the cow chewing the cut and bringing it back up or to take it in but we're to spend more time than just listening in church it's been said a Christian should speak and when we bleed we should bleed Bible you know that's what Jesus did on the", "cross don't you when he said my God my God why hast Thou forsaken me he didn't just come up with who's he quoting well he's quoting David Psalm 22 verse 1. first thing that's recorded that Jesus spoke on the cross at the worst moment when God was judging him he's bleeding Bible verses come out of him and by the way into thy hands I commend my spirit last words right from the scriptures use God's word I have a friend who I've known for years and years ago I was teaching in James where it says count it all joy in my brethren when you encounter various trials knowing the testing of your faith produces endurance and to this day every time he's in the hospital every time he's been having pain he always says the same thing I'll say how you doing he'll say counting it all joy and I know he's going through it when he says that but he means that I'm gonna I'm gonna choose to count it all joy here in the text these tassels were to remind them of God's word and some believe and I think it's probably true the fact that they were blue was to remind them of heaven where they were we are to pray thy will be done on Earth as it is in heaven someone has said the Bible b-i-b-l-e should stand for basic instructions before we leave Earth and I think that's pretty good but God has given us in his word everything that we need for life and godliness the Bible says in Christ we are given how to handle our failings we're we're told how to let the word of God teach us and instruct us when we blow it or someone else does and by the way God's word will bring you hope when you feel hopeless so spend more time in the word if you want to have hope to give away or hope for yourself it starts with the book that's full of Hope God's word let's all stand and we'll sing together before we go I once was oh I can see the love I want to invite you to pray for those that will be going from our church to Israel here at the end of this week and will bless the trip obviously with safety and that God will use it by the way I I've never done this before for the church but we're going to try when I'm on the Sea of Galilee I I did it briefly um in a previous year I was able to broadcast on Facebook actually", "so people could join us so I'm going to try that if you um if you're not my friend on Facebook uh befriend me before I get to Israel and it'll it'll notify it we go in the morning which is early evening here so we'll try to get the word out to everybody but it'd be fun to have you guys go to Israel with us and enjoy some of the trip if not uh physically and for a lot of money free and so if you want to do that uh it would be awesome it'd be just fun to know that you're watching and it'll be recorded if you don't get to see it in real time now may the Lord bless you may he keep you and make his face to shine upon you may he be gracious to you and lift up his countenance upon you in the name of the Father and Son and the Holy Spirit God bless", "yourself to pray now we're in leviticus and we'd like you to open your bible there i know some of you are new tonight outlines if you didn't get one on your way in please get one and you can even go now if you didn't get one and fill in the blanks we're going verse by verse through the book of leviticus and uh that's an interesting uh we're we're looking at things most people look over or pass through and we're asking the lord to show us jesus and also to teach us about him and it's been an amazing study so far but we're glad you're joining did i say leviticus good because it's not it's chapter 12. yeah okay i did all right leviticus 12 is one of the shortest chapters in this book and you will be praying for me after i read it i think after i you'll say how what are we going to do with that besides skip it leviticus chapter the lord spoke to moses saying speak to the sons of israel saying when a woman and bears a male child then she shall be unclean for seven days as in the days of she shall be unclean on the eighth day the flesh of his foreskin shall be circumcised and then she shall remain in the blood of her purification for 33 days she shall not touch any consecrated thing nor enter the sanctuary can't come to church until the days of her purification are if she bears a female child then she'll be unclean for two weeks not one week but two weeks as an administration and she shall remain in the blood of her purification for 66 days when the days of her purification are completed for a son or for a daughter she shall bring to the priest at the doorway of the tent of meeting a and a young pigeon or a turtle dove for offer it before the lord and make atonement for her and she shall be cleansed from her flow of blood this is the law for her who bears a child whether a male or a female but if she can't afford a lamb then she'll make take two turtle doves two young pigeons the one for a burnt atonement for her and she shall be clean let's go before the lord father probably none of us were worried about how we need to do these things if we're ever faced with it but you not only prepared your people to handle this ritual and the sacrifice of childbirth but you recorded it so that we would ask", "why is it here what does it have to do with my life and lord i'm convinced it has way more to do with us than we ever dreamed so would you help me would you speak to us and would you reveal truths that will help us to understand your heart in jesus name i pray amen you can have a seat so this chapter is is a brief on words yet very big on questions that it raises one question of course is well why is it here at all for me as a christian that i need to read it why is it even in the in the bible um and uh i suppose the most often asked question about this chapter is why in the world is there a difference in the time for the birth of a boy versus the birth of a girl for the mother to be unclean and to be purified you can ask the lord that when you get because i'm going to tell you because i always do i'll tell you my opinion about that but it's just my and uh even on this one you know i'm not going to say what i like to quote mcgee sometimes who says you don't have to agree with me you'd be wrong but uh i'm going to tell you i can't tell you for this is a difference here and neither can anybody else throughout history but there's plenty of rabbis and teachers who want to tell you their opinion um and i'm not going to even get into sharing a lot about that i'm simply going to suggest a reason that seems reasonable to me but i could be wrong the real important question that we need to ask though is not necessarily exactly what that means although that's the natural question but what can we learn why does god have it here for us and what what truths are here now if you weren't with us in the last chapter we were studying about the dietary laws what god told his people they could and what was clean what was unclean how to discern the difference between the two it was a whole chapter about the rules that we are no longer under aren't you glad we're not under god the bible says god declared everything as clean we can you can eat whatever you want you may be sorry you eat whatever you want but you it's up to you and food won't commend you to god if you eat or don't eat paul says so don't get yourself all weird about religious", "rules about eating there's some wisdom about eating and not eating too this is but the last chapter really talked to us the state of being unclean and and how touching that which is unclean can make you unclean remember we we talked about that the effects of sin and contamination through contact this chapter is a little it more emphasizes the internal characteristics of sin and just the simple basic truth that we are all born now you might say the last chapter was this chapter is more about obstetrics and god is the great physician who heals everybody and deals with all aspects he uses these analogies to teach truths so i'm entitled the message a sinner is born and you will understand as we go through it why so put this down we see here very clearly the doctrine of depravity the doctrine of depravity now when i use that term some of you have been familiarized studied or steeped in reformed theology and the doctrines of grace the first one of which is total depravity when i say what i'm saying here tonight i am not anything about that doctrine nor am i teaching the exact doctrine that those who follow calvin teach which has to do with the capacity of man to respond to the gospel etc although most of that i don't actually disagree with that's neither here nor there i believe the bible clearly teaches the depravity of man in many places and this passage kind of underscores that truth so put this down a birth as far as god is concerned is a time to see our need for cleansing that is pretty clear a baby is born doesn't matter what gender it is there's got to be a a time of impurity and a time of being that's very kind of different than the way we think even as christians as people in the world typically at a birth is a time of really it is in anticipation you know where my son and daughter-in-law they're having the shower this coming saturday and all of my life's uh well not my life my wife's life actually so i get sucked into the whirlwind has been revolving around that just that's the way it is we get very very excited and rightly so at every birth it's kind of a time of celebration but you need to see that god sees a birth as a time of purification that is not the way we think about it but it is the way god thinks about it and that's something we got to get from this passage now let me ask you a", "question how many of you have ever been to a jewish wedding really eight of us okay well you've seen it on tv probably then at the pronouncement of the priest or the rabbi i guess that their husband and they do if they have a traditional jewish wedding there's a moment in time right as their pronounced husband wifery kisses her there's happens at different times in ceremonies where there's the traditional breaking of a glass a little a glass is put under usually a cloth of some of they make them special for this but it's a glass and they're pronounced husband and wife no kayak at a wedding i now pronounce you husband and wife we've got to join together let no men put us under you may kiss the bride and in our services people then clap and celebrate but they don't do that they're pronounced husband and wife and then the groom usually sometimes the bride in the group normally the groom that glass it's very distinctive loud and then everybody shouts out which means congratulations here's my question do the jews break a glass wedding and the husband and wife what anybody know why anybody have a clue why they would do if you're raising your hand you need to tell me why why do they do it that's right actually the rabbis have different ideas as to why like marriage might be hard so you know but but but historically i'm not kidding you that's not like a joke probable is the tradition that it has to do with the not once but twice destruction of the jewish temple which by the way has still never rebuilt yet but we know it will be how do we know it because messiah's going to enter it according to jesus in the great uh i'm sorry the antichrist is going to uh uh i don't have a doubt the messiah will enter and destroy it but anyway um we know there will be a third temple but there is no temple now if you go with us to israel all we enjoy used to be over there there's nothing there except something else and so those two temples having been destroyed first one during the babylonian captivity they when they came in and destroyed 586 bc and then again in 68 70 a.d when the romans came and destroyed jerusalem they were destroyed and here's what the idea is at the moment of your highest happiness the moment you're that the temple was destroyed and taken away from us it is to make everybody go before you go yeah", "it's kind of weird but the idea is you can see that that's the right that's not biblical bible doesn't say you've got to do it or anything that's their idea now i say that because there's something i think happening in god's economy he's saying at the birth of your baby of course you're excited of course you can't wait of course it's a life-changing moment and there's a lot of celebration but there's something else i want you to be aware of and i am going to require this purification time every birth is a reminder of our need and that baby's need for cleansing and also for sacrifice and for restoration so the depravity of men the need of man jot down job 15 verses 14 through 16. if you're taking notes what is man that he should be pure or he who is born of a woman that he should be righteous behold god puts no trust in his holy ones the angels of course they sinned remember and the heavens are not pure in his sight how one who is detestable and corrupt man who drinks iniquity like water wow kind of describes man jeremiah 17 verse 9 you hear quoted often the human heart is more deceitful than all else and is wow don't sugarcoat it jeremiah tell us how you really feel who can even understand it that's why when people say i don't trust anybody about myself uh you better include yourself in the list of people you can't trust because you're deceitful above all romans 5 and verse 12 new testament verse therefore just as through one man adam sin entered into the world and death through sin and so death spread to all men because what all have sinned and all still sin first john 1 8 first john 1 8 says if we say that we have no sin well we're deceiving truth is not in us and first john 1 10 says this if we say we have not sinned him a liar and his word is not in us i grew up in the 60s and 70s and one of the popular songs in my teenage generation was one by a guy named norman spirit in the sky how many of you are old enough yeah whoa too many of you are old enough to know i'm not singing it but here are some of the words when i die and they laid me to rest i'm gonna go to the place that's the best when i laid me down to die going up to the spirit in the sky", "going up to the spirit of the sky that's where i'm gonna go when i die when i die and they lay me to rest i'm gonna go to the place that's the best and then here's some lines prepare yourself you know it's a must you gotta have a friend so you know that when you die he's going to recommend you to the spirit in the then these are the most important words i want to get at i've never been a sinner i never sinned i got a friend in jesus so you know that when i die he's gonna set me up with the spirit in the sky some people have norman greenbaum they really don't understand sin at all when they did a survey people magazine did a survey asking how often you sin how many times you sin a week most people say they sin clearly they have no concept of what the sin is otherwise you know and the people that went to church had a higher there was like four times or something not believers in what god says or just have never been exposed to how often we do sin certainly we sin and that is not usually an argument i have to have with somebody that they need a savior because they're a sinner they usually can accept that but there are some people who don't understand how sinful they are now man tends to portray absolute innocence in a mother holding a that's like the picture of innocence god does not okay so let's just be honest about that every mother brings into the world a minus mary every single mother who's ever given birth always brings into the world a sinner and by the way according to our text and i probably wouldn't have had to have shared it this way 10 years ago but there's only two versions male and female that's all there are there are not 77 varieties like facebook will give you for your gender there aren't even 31 flavors like baskin robbins just two that's all there have ever been and by the way they're both unclean according and so are you and so is anybody you parent or bring into this world put this down child birth is tied according to scripture to two things pain and sorrow jot down genesis 3 16 we got to go to the garden and understand some things that happened there to understand this passage to the woman eve god said i will greatly multiply your pain in childbirth let's stop there i do not know what childbirth would have been", "i don't know if evil is gone i do oh i have no i don't know all i know is whatever there would have been and that way anymore i haven't and she never had it any other way so to the woman he said i will greatly multiply your pain in childbirth in pain you shall bring forth children your desire shall be for your husband and you and he shall rule over you well we'll study that another time but that's an interesting passage childbirth most people totally misunderstand that but i'd like to tell you about that we is tied to pain and sorrow now most people most of us think oh that's what happens when a woman goes into labor i mean first of all the pregnancy morning sick that's no fun i guess right and then you know you're getting bigger and bigger and it's no fun and then you get to start labor and that's definitely no fun you know some man was asking what is it painful to have a baby i mean i don't know what man asks that what does it feel like and the woman said it's like if you could take your lip and stretch it out over your head because i like that you know you need to see something here in our text that though god said in pain you shall bring forth children it's not just referring to the process of giving birth why because you are birthing a brand new why it's way deeper than we thought look people are all into gender reveal parties now you know that's a kind of a new thing which is fun here in our passage it's not about gender reveal it's about nature revealing the nature of a child and it's not that we don't love children or grateful they're gifts from god but we need to see what god is talking about listen to this said doctor i'd like you to evaluate my 13 year old son the doctor said okay he's suffering from a transient psychosis with an intermittent rage disorder punctuated by radical mood swings but his prognosis is good for a full recovery he said how can you say all that without even meeting he said i thought you said he was 13. i like that one jay vernon mcgee said that the discipline the the the discipline in homes in america during his day and still true have broken down he said folks think they're raising a sweet little flower and actually what they have is a stink okay well there you go i couldn't have said it as eloquently as him", "i think people make a big mistake when they talk about our children i don't like to get into that discussion because i don't have a bible verse to do i believe they are i believe there's a good chance they are but i'm very careful about saying this is absolute here's what i can tell you if children are and up to a certain point i think their children aren't saved though because they're sinless that's really important you understand the bible nowhere teaches that for sure that they become sinful after they get born and start doing that's not what the bible teaches so children aren't saved because they're sinless if they're saved and go to heaven it's because god is and children are ignorant and god is merciful to the ignorant that's what the bible clearly teaches about god's grace paul said i found though i was the chief sinner because i ignorant god has mercy on the ninevite hundred and twenty thousand or however many were there who didn't know their left hand from the right hand they didn't they were ignorant it is the ignorance of man that allows god to move in mercy it's nothing about even get your idea of that the the tendency of all of us is to put a lot of hopes on our children and rightfully so we we're excited about them being part of our life and what their life has not lived yet and we hope for wonderful things and all that's the very first mother the words that she spoke when she gave birth to her child reveal in the text that she thought she was getting the messiah i have gotten a man-child with the help of the lord and god had said about the seed of the woman is going to crush the serpent's head she thinks it's happened i've got basically what she's saying is i've got the messiah you know who it was that was kane yep she'd be raising cain literally who would become the first murderer who will become an example of somebody who is of the devil according to scripture and that is not uncommon for us as mothers and fathers to think so highly of our children but we got to be careful romans 7 18 paul says this there is that dwells in me that is in my flesh the wishing is present but the doing of the good is not one way of putting it is this you can never overestimate the depravity of the wicked according to scripture now put this down number three we need more than natural birth to get right", "with god that is clearly taught we know that from the new testament but it's taught here in a sense as well so in our when a woman gives birth verse two to a male child then she shall be unclean so uncleanness immediately just because of the birth for seven days as in the days of her menstruation that's we'll get to that in chapter 15 we'll look forward to that chapter she will be unclean but look at this now verse three on the eighth day the the flesh of his foreskin shall be circumcised now that's interesting so he's uh there's an uncleanness that comes from the birth but then there's this act of circumcision now a jewish baby please notice this wasn't saved because his parents were jews he's not even in the covenant relationship with god because he was born a jew you need to see that he's born but he's not until the circumcision which brings him into that covenant relationship now that was the faith of the parents not the faith of the baby obviously and it's on the eighth day that's this symbolic day of new beginnings but it was circumcision was that that symbolism that god gave abraham to give all of his descendants that the parents would be saying our children are set apart for you they're part of the covenant and we what is the covenant that you are going to not only give us the land but through our seed galatians says through the seed singular the messiah all the nations of the earth will be blessed the promise of messiah and that covenant promise to you to be the ones who bring the messiah and he's going to save you and save this world ultimately is what you are getting to be a part of in the covenant very interesting but you're going to have to not only believe that you're going to have to deal if you will in the symbolism with the flesh the flesh must be removed jot down galatians 5 and verse 24 paul said it this way for the believer now those who belong to christ jesus have crucified the flesh with its passions and desires jesus said if anyone wishes to come after me let him deny himself take up his cross there has to be a death to self a death to the flesh and the bible talks a lot about this in romans 6. now so we need more than just natural birth they're you're born into a state of uncleanness here we see circumcision as being a way faith could be expressed where somebody could enter into that", "relationship with god put this down number four we must believe and obey what we don't understand i say that because in verse 4 we have this verse that says she shall remain in the blood of her purification for 33 days she shall not touch any consecrated thing nor enter the sanctuary until the days of her purification are completed and then it starts to talk in verse 5 about how a girl the period of uncleanness is longer and so we naturally would say well what's the of that does it mean that girls are does it mean that mom becomes more unclean by giving birth to a girl the bible is clearly not ancient cultures were very much gender elevating of males you will find though there are people that accuse the bible of being a preferential for men and that's because they really don't know the culture that it was written in nor ultimately what scripture says but here's before we get to that i want to talk about there are times in life and plenty of times in the bible where you don't understand why god is saying to do something and it's those moments in your life where you don't understand why or how what god is saying is going to work out that i really believe god intends there to be some and i say that because he could have very clearly told us in the word what his thinking was here and i don't have it he doesn't tell us and therefore i remind myself what i remind you you know a lot of you know this first because i've encouraged you to to memorize this one where when people ask you things that you can't answer from scripture does anybody remember the the key verse it's deuteronomy okay now you can have you can write it down when somebody asks you something not that you don't know but is not knowable from scripture so you got another scripture no that's not in there that verse says this the hidden things belong to god that tells me right away there are some things that are hidden he just said it the hidden things whatever those are what are they i don't know they're the things we don't know but the things that have been revealed belong to us and our sons that we might obey god in other words god has not told us everything there's a lot we don't know what was god doing 4 trillion years ago uh before the demons fell what exactly was jesus doing every day ah what would we be doing we'd be doing", "billions of years from now all day long i don't know there's a lot we don't know just about eternity but there's a lot of things we don't know even about history and that is the nature of man we just don't know everything now let me give an example jesus and his disciples are coming to and they're not the only ones there's a lot of other people coming okay and the jews that are coming are happy they're singing the songs of ascent as they ascend toward jerusalem from the judean desert they're coming up over the mount of olives here in bethany and it's exciting because you see the temple you see jerusalem it was a sight i mean it was one of the wonders of the world okay and they longed to be there it was one of the happiest moments they didn't live there they visited there and a lot of jews they didn't always get together this might be their first time maybe they lived out of the country too far away and now they're coming so there's a lot of joy a lot of excitement and the the followers of jesus are excited about being with him and lazarus had been raised from the dead and there are people excited in the group who knew about that it was an amazing time and jesus stops that processional and he says you guys need to go over and get me a donkey from that town over there now just put yourselves in the sandals of one of the disciples you never you always just walk you need a dung it's not i can see that it's not that the kid drove not that far jesus we're almost there now no one said this i'm just putting you into the mind of jesus i know a guy in town that has a whole bunch of donkeys on sale you know bogo coupon i can tomorrow let's all these people are waiting we're gonna put the parade on pause what this is palm sunday i mean they didn't say that here's what i know from scripture the disciples did not know anything about zechariah 9 being fulfilled that day which says that the messiah has to come in on a donkey they admitted it we read it they read it with the benefit of the rear view mirror they go yes this was to fill what zechariah said behold jerusalem daughter you king comes to you humble mounted on a donkey even the fall of a donkey jesus did that to fulfill that and then one of them's", "honest enough to say but at the time we didn't really know until after he rose from the dead a little footnote there in other words they had no clue now why do i say all that just to say this how often is the lord saying to do something and people are going uh why do we really what i don't get it all right moses people are thirsty here's what i want you to do i want you to hit the rock over there i'm not an expert on physics but i'm not really sure that works that way hit the rock and water's gonna go could you just explain to me exactly how that works before i do it and next time i'm just going to tell you to talk to it you'll hit it twice we'll have other problems with you but the fact is this how often is god telling his people to do something that they just need to do it so why do i say that because if you come away from this chapter saying why the difference between the two amounts of time i don't get it okay that's not the question the question is will you obey him will you by faith do what he's telling look it's our problem too we must believe and obey when we don't understand and i want to suggest to you that jesus writing the donkeys may be a good analogy why because it's kind of like he's writing going you guys will wait till i rose from erased from the dead you'll get it there but just obey me now that day for us on this passage will be when we get to heaven and the lord will say here's look jesus is doing stuff in our lives and commanding his people to do stuff that the pictures will become clearer later and maybe it'll be in this life because of scripture maybe it'll be in heaven when we're with him though now we see through a mirror face to face now i know in part the small part then i shall know fully just as i also have been fully known put this down number five impurity is pictured in double time with a future the sayeth the bob okay so don't make anything of this i've heard a lot of ideas as to why well it gives the mother more time to bond with the daughter the idea is well they're unclean meaning they didn't have to go back to their normal life and back to the temple so there's more time together so moms and daughters can bond more it's like", "okay where does it say that may be true and other ideas like you know girls are harder to raise um this is not teaching that though that may be true i don't know i raised three sons i god knew he couldn't give me a girl you know why because i would have marched her down the aisle and we would have never made it to the end i just tell you we were not trusting a single they gave me boys i don't think that's what this is about it's not because girls commit more sin it's going to cost them more to purify what i want you just to suggest and again just to think about there's double the amount of time exactly twice the amount of time given for the cleansing and the purification now follow my reasoning here doubling is all used all through scripture to emphasize something remember when jesus says truly truly i say to you actually the word in greek is just amen amen when when the lord wants to speak to somebody you notice how he calls him usually twice saul saul why are you there's a repetition moses mo there's a we can get it that there's special paid god says at one point concerning israel and her sins i have returned to her double for all of her sins god speaks about the the firstborn son of an unloved wife now referring to a husband who has he says that that firstborn who's born to the leah in this case the first she's the first it's the firstborn son i don't care that he doesn't love her he must by law give her be it's kind of like in reverse she the wife has been shamed the the child doesn't receive honor god says double it you're going to give double always this idea of of somehow underlining it maybe the idea is this has her be purified for her male son it's this amount of time 40 days but when it's a female what you have are two a little baby girl who's going to be a future and so he is underscoring if you will this is another one who's going to birth children who are sinful and therefore in her case i want to double it up that's just a possibility and it makes to me child birth is god's reminder of the curse for all but in a special way for women why because back in genesis the curse for the woman was placed on very interesting so maybe that's what this is all about i'm not saying for sure it is um", "put this down letter b as we get into the last few verses here verses six through eight we see that god is an equal opportunity savior and i want you to see this from the second half of this chapter put this down even the best mother needs to be in verse six now when the days of the mother are her purification are completed regardless for a male or she shall bring to the priest at the doorway of the tent of meeting a then he shall offer it before the lord and make atonement for her and she shall be cleansed from the flow of her blood this is the law for her who bears a child whether a male or a female so suddenly we go from this difference of the time that she has to be in her impurity to the sacrifice that needs to be made to restore her and sacrifice exactly the same no difference at all you know um it's true for some of us in this room not all of us but our mother was the one who led us how many hair your mom led you to the lord okay or had a big impact on your christian life okay a lot of times god uses mothers in a way that sometimes aren't used my mom was used in my life as a significant witness and and maybe you as a mom have led your kids to the lord um i remember hearing a story of a little boy who was in a play at church he had never been in a play and he was terrified uh when he had one line his line was i am the light of the world but he looked out at the audience his mom was sitting in the front row and he completely forgot his line and his mom goes i am lying to the world i am the light of the world my mom is the light of the world i don't care how godly your mom is and how much she reflected the lord's character and maybe she was a proverbs she has to bring i don't care who she is and the pigeon of the eternal does for a we know what those are they're a type of christ best mom has to be purified it's the same price for male or female precisely the same it's the death of jesus christ that is being pictured rules out every idea that's tied also with a a low view of women uniquely god raises the value of women in the old ten new testaments significantly", "but it tells us this mary had to be purified after she gave birth to jesus now jesus had no sin but mary did i know there are some who teach otherwise on that but the bible doesn't teach that jot down luke uh jot down luke 2 verses 21-24 listen to what luke records because it comes right back to our text when eight days were completed before christ's circumcision his name was then called jesus the name given by the angel before he was conceived in the womb and when the days for their purification that'd be the okay according to the law of moses leviticus 12 were completed they brought jesus up to jerusalem to present him to the lord as it is written in the law of the lord every firstborn male that opens the womb shall be called holy set apart to the lord and they came to offer a sacrifice according to what was said in the law of the lord notice a pair of turtle doves or two young pigeons now that's very interesting because look at our last verse if she cannot afford a lamb then she shall take two turtle doves by the way you know the song twelve days across two turtle doves it's about this it i'm not kidding that really is about this she'll take two turtle doves or two young pigeons the one for a burnt and the priest shall make atonement for her and she will be clean had to be purified not because jesus was sinful but because she was a sinner by the way this also gets at one other thing i'll just mention sometimes people think well jesus was born without a human father and because he was born without a human father he was sinless because he only came through the woman and the holy spirit so the sin nature must be transmitted through the that is called psalm 51 verse 5 david says this behold i was brought forth in iniquity and in sin my wasn't the dead wasn't involved but my mother conceived me don't get the thinking that somehow the sin nature couldn't have come into jesus because joseph wasn't involved only married that's not what that's that's not trying to teach us that at all mary is just as much a sinner as joseph and she needed a savior you say prove it oh good i'm glad i asked that question luke 1 verses 46 and 47 not only did you have to be purified as a sinner and mary said this is called the magnificat my soul exalts the lord and my spirit has", "rejoiced in god my creator savior you don't need a savior if you're not a sinner mary declared she was in the old testament were protected from the cultures around them and from the way the culture would have been for instance in divorce god had moses and the law give a certificate of divorce the disciples misunderstood that to mean oh god permits divorce moses said give them a certificate of divorce no no jesus said that's not supposed to be the way it works he did that because of your hardness of heart because you're just going just sending the wives out and finding another wife and there's been no freedom legally for her to remarry no no it's because of your sinfulness that that law was ever given so god protected women the unloved wife was protected in the law of god they was not protected by other cultures in the new testament you see something fascinating about jesus being a jewish healer a rabbi he allows himself to be touched by an unclean woman do you understand what the law said if you touch a woman you become unclean no rabbi would ever do that the pharisees used to bring their garments in close when they would just walk through crowds of people because they didn't want to touch the jesus allowed himself to be touched by an unclean woman who was unclean morally remember at the banquet of simon the pharisee who says he couldn't be a prophet otherwise he would know what kind of a woman that was oh he knew exactly what kind of woman that was who was touching his feet weeping and washing them wiping them with her hair or the woman with a hemorrhage of blood remember she is totally unclean according to the law but she says if i touch the hem of this garment i'll be made whole when jesus gets touched he didn't say you touched you unclean woman now like you ruined my day he doesn't he says your faith has made you well it's very interesting to me the value of women in the new testament is amazing because for instance who does jesus first reveal himself to on the day he's resurrected very first why is that so sick because he tells and he tells and the angels tell her and then and then jesus tells her go tell my meet you up in galilee to the mountain that i designated which i knew which one that was but anyway i'll meet him up there now that's interesting it's primarily interesting because in the jewish culture a woman could not go", "into a court of law and be a witness wasn't considered a credible witness you're a woman they got out of jury duty i think too anyway that's another story so jesus reveals himself to mary a woman incredible in fact the new covenant that god had promised the fulfillment the bringing in of the messianic age which by the way doesn't start with christ's return starts with christ's first coming but jesus is going to bring in with the coming of the holy spirit on the day of we call it pentecost on the day of first fruits and pentecost god poured out the holy spirit the new covenant that was promised in the book of jeremiah begins what you need to understand one of the most significant things about the new covenant compared to the old covenant is the way god was going to choose to work not only is the holy spirit going to come in us and stay with us that's true but something going on with gender and so peter on the day of pentecost from joel because people there in jerusalem were saying these guys are all just drunk they're all speaking gibberish so they're all happy they've been drinking too much wine and peter says it's way too early for i'm thinking would be okay later but he said this isn't what you think they're not drunk but this is that which was spoken of by joel the prophet where joel chapter 2 and then he quotes joel tell me peter's an uneducated and untrained man he knew his bible very well he didn't go just a minute i got to find it in my concordance no he knew it and it shall be in the last days god says that i will pour out my spirit upon and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy and your young men shall see visions and your old men shall dream dreams even upon your maidservants and your man's male and fema the spirit of god without discretion is gonna pour himself out on all flesh not just men but on ladies and on servants on servant girls and you're going to be able to prophesy which is the highest gift in the church according to first corinthians 14 god will use without respect for your status in the society god can use you oh baby that's right and so jot down galatians 3 28 it's one of the distinctive natures of the new covenant there is neither jew nor greek there is neither slave nor free there is neither for you are all one in christ jesus now", "this is not the eradication of all gender that's not the point but in christ as far as our value what does peter say you husbands treat your wives as fellow heirs of life in other words pure equals spiritually or your prayers will be literally cut off god's not listening to you you think you're all close to god and god doesn't care about you if you don't treat her as an equal god says i won't even listen to oh no the exaltation of women the raising of women is all through the new testament put this down our hope is not in our kids but only in god's son it is natural like eve to have this great dream that this child that's going to be born is going to do great things and there's nothing wrong with that and giving your vision to your kids i think we need to speak more blessing on our jot down an interesting passage in this regard something that lamech did in genesis 5 verses 28 and 29. listen listen to what lambic said lemek lived 182 years and that's when he became a he called his son and this word noah means comfort in hebrew this one shall give us rest from our work and from the toil of our hands arising from the ground which the lord is cursed in other words life is hard because of the curse of god this boy i see him bringing about just rest and like yeah that's not exactly where that one's going to end quite like that there lemek seems to me god's going to use him to bring judgment on the entire earth and wipe out everybody except his family but then i can see that because i always yeah but it's our tendency to see oh god's going to do these great things and then many times we are very disappointed that our children don't fulfill those the reason is is because our baby boy or baby girl are not sinless there's only that has been born like that and it's not yours it's not mine first timothy 2 verses 9 through 15 is another passage that bothers people so you might as well look at that one tonight too um paul is talking about women teaching in and usurping authority over men and he said likewise i want women to adorn themselves with proper clothing modestly and discreetly not with braided hair and gold or pearls or costly garments but rather by means of good works as befits it's proper for women making a claim to godliness a christian woman let a woman", "quietly receive instruction with entire i do not allow a woman to teach and the word dedoscolas there means to be an authoritative teaching role in the church doesn't mean she can't teach anybody ever but i do not allow a woman to teach or exercise authority over a but to remain quiet and then it's interesting what he argues from it was adam who was first created and then eve and it was not adam who was deceived but the woman eve being quite deceived fell into transgression but then he says this if that wasn't weird enough but women shall be saved as the greek word literally it says preserved but it's so so it's saved the bearing of children if they continue in faith and love and sanctity with self-restraint it's like paul can we just have a few question answers about what you just there's some faqs about that passage what is the role of women and what in the world are you talking about have a baby go to heaven is that what is that what are you saying there let me just help you with that he's not saying a woman has to give birth to children to go to heaven he is saying christian women should live out their believe me paul's not saying you need to do anything to be saved we know what he believed about how salvation comes that's ephesians 2 8 name for by grace you are saved not through words there's nothing you can do but if you are saved you will demonstrate that faith by the way you live and he talks about modesty he talks about humility and being submissive to authority a wife to her because though he's not perfect he's the one that god wants her to demonstrate that faith in him by being submissive to these are all expressions of faith accepting god's purpose for their life so when he talks about bearing children they'll be saved not by means of having children but through having children he's talking about the great mandate that was given to adam and eve be fruitful and multiply fill the earth and subdue it in other words accepting god's role that he's given you you uniquely are able of bearing children accepting that is part of my will for your life if it is and being filled with the holy spirit in your character he's just saying live out your faith demonstrate your faith in god but it's interesting he comes back to this idea of childbearing of course there is an interesting other thing and that is this that child bearing which is cursed", "becomes the very means by which god brings the savior isn't that neat god curses childbearing and then he redeems it and he uses it to bring the salvation to mankind and he says i want you to accept that if that's your calling you're a wife and to to say i see that as part of my uniquely a blessing that i get to have to honor the lord and so interesting to me that uh childbearing reveals the sinfulness of man but it also demonstrates the grace of god finally we'll finish this being restored to the lord is within your reach now i don't mean it's within your power but it's within your reach why do i say verse eight is amazing to me because god says here's the only way to get uh uh restored you gotta have a lamb which was not inexpensive and because we know it has to be unblemished remember it's it's the it's expensive you weren't redeemed with silver and gold but with the precious blood of a lamb lambs worked this kind of lamb was not cheap okay for the sacrificing and then you had to have the birds for so okay have to have a lamb but then he gives us proviso in verse eight ah by the way if somebody can't afford a just use the birds they're not that expensive you can two turtle doves two pigeons just use what what is this telling us just this god said you must bring a lamb but if you can't afford a lamb can i suggest to you he just described he said some people could you can't afford this lamb the lamb that this one's picturing you can't earn that see the bible says we're redeemed with the precious blood of the lamb unblemished and unspotted that's way above your pay grade what does the old song say he paid a debt he did not owe because i owed a and so god says you know what if somebody can't afford it because there will be a lot of people who can't and in our case it's all of us we don't deserve we can't earn what christ did for us god puts all the cookies on the bottom shelf salvation costs god's son and that's not one life that i can afford to earn but it's offered to the lord by all that's what you want to see here it is too costly so he offers it to all of us verse 8 is in essence every whosoever you ever read in the bible for god so loved the world that you can reach it", "whosoever calls on the name of the lord can be in other words and by the way mary and joseph you can read in luke they couldn't afford the lamb they offered up the birds they were poor be restored to the lord no matter who you are no matter what you've done he's made it within your to reach out for the blood of christ that was shed for you pay for your own redemption so he put your restoration my restoration where we can reach it amen i want to now apply it lord it's not just about moms and dads that are having babies and lord i know you're not breaking the glass at the moment of birth is that we shouldn't enjoy the celebration of a new the lord if every time a baby is being born you want your people and that's us to remember that we're birthing a sinner just like us that we can't give them eternal life that they need to be born again they need by faith something more than the to be born of believing families just as they did in our text then lord would you remind us we need to share our faith we need to move in faith with our children and help them to know and to this god of the covenant that sent his lord i thank you that you see us the way we really are and you're willing to tell us that we are unclean before you in ourselves there must be a sacrifice that you have ordained the lamb must be slain or lord there is no restoration we are here to say thank you that you paid the price and then made faith something that we can express no matter how much we don't understand no matter how far for how long we've been away from you lord we're not so poor spiritually that we can't be saved i thank you you said blessed are who are poor for theirs is the kingdom lord would you save even some tonight that are here maybe who don't understand a word that i said but understand that you're knocking on the door of their heart and they are the that needs to reach out to you tonight thank you that your grace is ready to be if we'll allow it to be by faith fill us with your spirit teach us your word teach us the truths that you need and want us to understand for our lives and our ministries in jesus name i pray amen let's all stand and sing together it is paid in full precious love that my jesus", "the stone is rolled away you know paul in the new testament says that it's possible a person would be willing to die for a it's known that somebody would give their life for their family or for their for other soldiers jumping on a grenade it happens it's rare but it does happen but people don't die for wicked people that way people don't die for their enemies that nobody does that see when god died when christ died for us we were his absolute enemies no one does that that's the kind of love that god has for us very interesting to me because blood all through the old is what gives us life it's precious but it also defiles it's with that the woman is unclean in her blood but i thought blood was life life is in the blood but i don't care how wonderful a person can never cleanse anybody including them all it can do is transmit uncleanness we need something more than a good wonderful loving person to save us we need the blood of jesus christ you see it is at an entirely different level his blood alone cleanses us from if you're here tonight and you're feeling like i don't understand half of what you said pastor in fact half would be way more than what i want to pretend i understood about this passage but i do believe in god and i do sense through this message that i need to realize and deal with the fact that i'm and i don't focus much on that i'll tell you something this world won't say much to you about that i have news for you there's a lot of churches where you're not going to hear much about that either but god is willing to tell you the truth because he loves you and because he wants to offer you an answer for that in he is the only answer for that it's already been done he's not asking you to figure it out he's asking you to so if you're struggling with your own sin you're struggling with your own salvation we'd love to pray with you our prayer room is open if you have another we'd love to to pray over you don't be offended by the word of god you'll be offended by me all day long i don't mind don't be offended by the word of god when you go i don't get it say but god i'm glad you do do you know how many times i've read the wild and say god i don't have a clue exactly what you mean here but someday i", "will might be after i die but if possible i'd like to understand some more now i'm okay with not understanding everything god says i really am i when people ask me what does this mean it's like i have no idea i'm not supposed to because i'm a pastor because i read and study the bible i i god i'm amazed by what god wrote i really am the wisdom of god there are wonderful truths in the word and things we don't yet understand and the few that we get a glimpse of they're amazing to me so don't let the bible put because it's very easy to read this and go why why is there a difference between the women and the men and what's what's god trying to say nothing that should be offensive to you unless it needs to be offensive to you now may the lord bless you may he keep you may he make his face to shine upon you may be gracious unto you and give you peace in the name of the father and the son and the holy spirit god bless you", "indeed all who desire to live godly in Christ Jesus will be persecuted Lord we want to follow good examples we need good examples in our life and I thank you that you sent your son so we might know what righteousness really is but lord we can get discouraged because Jesus was sinless and we're not Lord we want to honor you we want to grow in Christ's likeness and in these last days we want to make sure that we're not only following good examples but we are becoming them so teach us from your word what that looks like as Paul talks to his son in the faith Timothy in Jesus name I pray amen you can be seated it was years ago now but Becky and I took the family up to San Francisco for a little vacation we used to do the motel 6 route up the coast you know and loves they had a pool we were good to go with the kids but Becky and I um I remember we went to a it wasn't an art museum or a History Museum it was actually Ripley's museum believe it or not there and I saw a section that they have this has always been fascinating to be somebody gone around collecting interesting different curious epitaphs tombstones what was on them and there's a lot of Monica's sure mold there's funny ones this one there was one that literally said here lies less more clot to slugs from a 44 no less no more and another one said it was for guiding Harry Johnson said Harry Johnson devoted atheist pardon me for not rising you know well I think another one said another devotee if it's all dressed up and nowhere to go yeah but I was thinking about that you know I don't know I haven't had any thoughts about what might be on my tombstone I don't even have a tombstone but if you've ever thought about that what would you want to be said if people are walking by and they see just your name that you live you know 20 years 50 100 years no whoa what would you like it to say it's kind of hard to maybe think maybe some of you figured that out but I suppose for us as believers and thinking about it I wouldn't mind if it could say here lies a good example of course I won't be lying there I'll be in heaven but you know what I mean a good example you know interesting what Paul wrote to the church at Thessalonica you can jot it down if you want first", "Thessalonians 1 verses 6 and 7 he said this to them he said you Church became imitators of us talking about Paul in the apostolic Lord he became imitators of us in the Lord having received the word in much tribulation with the joy of the Holy Spirit so that you became an example to all the believers in Macedonia and Achaia interesting here in essence the church at Thessalonica all he had that epitaph while they were alive you imitated us and you became a living example of what it means to be a believer so I want to talk about exampling today so here's the question I want to start out with you can fill in the blank put in the word followed the question I have is are you being and if not why not as a believer are you being followed and if not why not John Zechariah 8 and verse 23 here talking about the last days and the Millennial Kingdom Zechariah writes this thus says the Lord of hosts in those days ten men from all the nations will grasp the garment of a Jew now these are Jews who have come to believe in Messiah they will grasp the garment of a Jew saying let us go with you for we have heard that God is with you it ought to be that as believers in Christ because of what's happened in our life other people realize you have something I need you have something I want you can lead me to where I need to be spiritually the Chinese have a saying he who thinks he is leading when no one is following is just taking a walk now I know when it comes to this whole area of living as an example saying follow me you know people that could never say that in fact Christians almost feel like it's better they don't follow me follow Jesus may I say something to you that sounds so humble and it's so unbiblical six times Paul says follow me follow me as I follow the Lord imitate me to Timothy and Titus repeatedly we shouldn't get into the door Jesus you know fold it's true we don't preach ourselves we preach Christ but that listen if you say oh I'm not a worthy example I'm a Christian but I'm not a worthy example then repent don't use that as your excuse why you don't have to be an example God's called you to be an example the writer to the Hebrews says by this time you ought to be teachers but you've come to need milk and not solid food stop making excuses", "for your immaturity but say Lord I want to become an example to my children to my wife or my family or to my neighbors who don't know you to the people that I work with you are more of the gospel than most non-christians will ever read your life is and so we don't want that to be wasted well put this down if you were genuine maturity spiritual maturity involves imitation faith imitation faith you say what do you mean by that you know my father was a reader he was brilliant man but he was a he read that's probably why he was so smart he had a big library and I remember as a young Christian going into his den and looking at he had all kinds of books on theology some were liberal theology some were more conservative but I remember seeing a title that bothered me it said imitation Christ and I thought I don't know everything I know this imitation is not good as a kid my mom used to sneak the powdered milk into the some of your mom's did that to save money she'd put it into a real milk carton it was just powdered with water oh he knew right away there's poison in the fridge do not go to the anyway anything imitation is just fake and you know fake stuff just this in the real deal right and so when I write imitation that's got to be liberal weird theology I didn't know much about church history actually it's not imitation Christ it was the imitation of Christ written by Thomas a Kempis probably one of the most well read books in all of 2,000 years of church history I know he didn't write it until the 15th century but a faceting it was about imitating Christ is it actually a very solid devotional book about this principle in Scripture that we are called to be imitators and followers of Christ so I say this genuine true spiritual maturity does involve imitation faith the word that Paul uses there in verse 10 you followed these things in my life is an interesting word it literally means to walk on a road together with someone long enough that you really know them it could mean to trace something out to conform to to even perfectly understand it's the word the Luke uses when he says in the beginning of his gospel I have studied out the life of Christ no I was not with Jesus walking the roads but I came to study his life out until I perfectly understand his ministry it's an interesting word and Paulo Saint", "Timothy that's you now Paul has just been talking about the difficulty of false teachers that are in the church that there are people in the last days they'll be very popular we'll discover it later in the chapter in the last days people will run after teachers having itching ears to hear a message that they want to hear Matt tell you this is there's nothing new first of all into the Sun according to Ecclesiastes we've all heard it before but if you go back in your Bibles and look up what is the message of a false prophet a false prophet always has an appealing message they speak what you want to hear so you got to be careful if you like what you hear it doesn't make it true in fact one of the atoms not saying if you like my message it's false I'm just simply saying the fact is false teachers will tell you what you want to hear they'll make you feel good they won't call you to repent of your sin they won't speak about judgment and hell though they are clearly in Scripture and this is the day and age we live in we know that so Paul is saying but Timothy you've had a good example in your life in my life that's what he's actually saying you have followed me you know who I am and you've come to understand my ministry now since you have that good example do the same put this down a great leader is first a good follower has to be why because character is more taught then taught remember when Jesus went looking for what he would call later his apostles or what we call his apostles his representatives you know the word apostle means to be sent away with a message ha ha a Greek away from Stello to sin those who are the official representatives of Christ that's what that means an apostolic ministry and these unique men there were many disciples or many followers of Jesus but he chose certain men to uniquely represent him that he was going to build the church upon the foundation of the apostles and the prophets the Bible says but Jesus did not say I am looking for leader type personalities only leader types ought to apply no it's just the opposite he said follow me and I'll do what well I'll make you what you're not follow me I'll make you fishers of men you're just fishers of fish but I'll change you it isn't about what you bring to him it's what he brings to you if you", "want to be a great leader you must learn to be a good follower so here's the question that I got to ask you by the way there's an excellent book about how Christ discipled his disciples if you're in if you're a person involved in ministry I would encourage you to read it it's it's it's talking about how Jesus spent time with his disciples and as a result of the time that he spent with them he not only taught them the doctrines but he taught them their behaviors that they needed to have by watching him it's called call to discipleship but here's the thing about it you read this in Matthew chapter 7 when Jesus preached what we call the Sermon on the Mount and he had preached a lot of important principles the Bible says the results were these that the people who heard him marveled because he spoke to them as one having Authority and not as their scribes what does that mean well the Jewish teachers of Christ's day would always quote somebody else as rabbi Hillel once said house rabbi Chevy I says and they would quote somebody else for the authority Jesus didn't do that he said you have heard it said but I say to you he would say thus saith the Lord and people weren't used to that there was power there was Authority when Christ spoke in fact you remember the soldiers who went to arrest him came back and they didn't have Jesus so remember they said where's Jesus you're supposed to arrest you or you know you haven't heard him speak have you you should come next time I did he was no one ever spoke like Jesus spoke but we read this in the Gospel of Mark when Jesus spent the night in prayer and he chose those men who would be his apostles their first mission was not to preach their first mission was not to cast out demons those were included of things they would do their first responsibility listen to me now was to simply be with him that was first to be with him and then to teach and then to cast out demons etc why because that's where character is learned in the book of Acts after Jesus ascends to heaven the disciples are filled with the spirit and they heal a man that was lame and they're arrested for it they are get arrested they get busted for healing a guy it's kind of interesting and their call took because they're preaching Jesus and before the Sanhedrin the Supreme Court of Israel and they're you", "know these are the guys the Supreme Court their hands are bloody with the blood of Jesus just a few days previous and now the Apostles are standing before them and these are the same guys who ranted fear before the Spirit of God came on them but it's so interesting what happens Peter stands up and he says there is salvation and no one else there is no other name given among men by which we must be saved he just lays it out you killed your Messiah is what he says and then the reaction is what I love in acts 4:13 that says now as they the Sanhedrin observed the the word in Greek is per Asya it's translated confidence it literally means all speech as they observed that boldness of Peter and John and understood they were just uneducated and untrained men they were fishermen they began to recognize them as having been with Jesus sound familiar what Jesus was which they weren't which was where men who spoke with authority they became under the influence of the Holy Spirit and the example of Jesus Christ and that is the way we are to grow in Christ's likeness is to see it in somebody else and of course Christ is our ultimate model so my question for you is this who are you spending time with these how I spend time with the who else let me ask it this way who are you spending time with that you want to be more like and if you go well nobody that's a huge red flag that should be being waved in front of you why because the Bible says he who walks with the wise will become wise a large group like this is great for disseminating information it's not so effective for personal transformation jot down proverbs 27 and verse 17 iron sharpens iron so one man sharpens another for iron to sharpen iron requires direct contact not just observation frankly it also will involve friction to knock off the rough edges that's just true as well I remember many years ago I got a call from my pastor this is before this church existed I was a intern pastor at my church and just started out in the ministry and they said hey there's a guy who wants to be discipled he had been an alcoholic and he's repented and he wants to you know he's young man about your age you'd like to walk with the Lord can you disciple him I said sure so I had some materials I'm hot you know ten steps to maturity or whatever it was a", "book we went through yeah so we got together at my house actually my apartment I was just married and he would come over every week and we would go through biblical principles and he was studying committed student of the word and I could see he was serious about walking with the Lord and I think three or four weeks after we had started he looked over he I had a racquetball racquet sitting there he said you play racquetball I said well I haven't been like lately but I used to it said well I play said you want to go out sometime to play some racquetball I said sure neither one of us could afford to join a club like baby we used to when we were single so I I we went over to floor it in college they have some outdoor courts it's free the only thing about playing outdoor racquetball some of you know this is that unless you're really good you wind up hitting it over the over the wall sometimes at least we did you know you hit it accidentally over the wall and and the ball would just go and unfortunately where we played it would it would land inside the tennis courts where there are people playing tennis and being disrupted by you and you had to go excuse me again and go get your ball and so it's a little frustrating well anyway so we went over there we started playing and you know we accidentally hit it into the tennis courts just like other people would do and it's not that big a deal but I remember at the end of playing one day at the water fountain he said to me can I ask you a question I said sure he said why is it when I headed over the wall I start cussing and yelling and you never do I said that's just because you didn't know the old me just that I said but the Lord has helped me I'm still competitive but I like winning but I don't mind if I lose cuz it's about being with you more than it is about winning I already know I'm better than you I didn't say that I'm just kidding what's it true my point is this you can sit in a Bible study the rest of your life and not really disciple anybody because too many Christians think discipleship is all about content and knowledge it's about character it's about relationship it's about your relationship with the Lord and that's gonna be seen in real life so", "I'm so glad so many of you got to go to camp with us last week we need to be together you guys it won't happen in a Bible study it won't happen in a sermon these are important times don't get me wrong we need to be with each other that's how Jesus discipled I want you to jot down Philippians 3 and verse 17 brethren join in following my wife is a my teaching my example and observe those who walk live according to the pattern you haven't us it's all through the New Testament jot down Hebrews 13 and verse seven this is the verse that came to mind when Pastor Chuck passed away remember those who led you who spoke the Word of God to you and consider the result of their conduct and then what imitate their faith in other words you should be seeing their faith in their conduct not just their sermons interesting when Paul tells the Corinthians imitate me he doesn't send them a sermon series he sends them a son you say what jotted down 1st Corinthians 4 verses 16 and 17 therefore he says to them I exhort you be imitators of me for this reason I've sent you Timothy who is my beloved and faithful child in the Lord he will remind you of my ways which are in Christ just as I teach everywhere in every church now I think I've been using every excuse to show my grandson to you and I find myself still wanting to do that so I have a picture probably gonna stop doing never so this is just a normal experience in my house this is my two-year-old grandson Jeffrey who gets into my closet and and finds shoes he likes to wear my shoes and so he came out I said hey those are Papa's shoes my shoes he just owned them you know and I don't mind of funny walk watching him walk around but but this is normal everybody who has children know this children love to imitate that's how they learn and of course we don't mind being the example as imperfect as we are right you know it's cute and all that but there's a principle the Bible says us here in Ephesians 5 as beloved children be imitators of God and walk in love even as God forgave you in Christ in other words we're to be like the Lord we're to imitate because He loves us and we love him it's so interesting to watch you know my my grandson loves sitting in the car and playing with the car and he", "loves my motorcycle he loves he doesn't want me to start that's terrifies him so he can hardly talk but he he knows enough to communicate I want to get on your motorcycle and so every morning you know it's either Papa's tah that means Papa's car or I don't know why my own means motorcycle and so he'll get on it and he'll tell me the entire time going out to it no target no target and I'm not even thinking about starting it but he just just in case and if I go reaching toward anything near the key not hard it you know cuz he's just like something's gonna blow up or EE anyway but he has this ritual of things that he does he gets on it he turns the key on he turns it back off again he opens every crevice that can be opened with the key and he goes back to my glove my saddlebags on the back of the key there and he likes to lock and unlock it repeatedly and then he opens only one side always the right side never the middle of the left just the right side I don't know why but that's what yes he opens the right side and it opens and then he closes it and he always says him he closed the deals and he hits it once now I know why he does that that's because I do that I know why I do that I do it cuz it doesn't seal usually the first I'm gonna have to tap it he doesn't he just does it one reason because Papa does it it's got to be good gotta be a reason I don't know it just it's amazing to me but it is within the nature of children and Paul says Timothy you followed me you you got it you got you understand me and you were displaying me here's what Jesus said it's enough for a disciple to become like this master in fact that's the goal I want to be just like Jesus I want to do what Jesus does as the visible moon reflects the invisible Sun so we as believers are visible to this world and we're to reflect the invisible Sun to the people around us in the church and those outside just put this down check these areas for example in your life first of all we're to be examples by our beliefs and our behavior put in the word beliefs in behavior he in verse 10 you followed my teaching and my conduct my teaching in other words you're teaching Timothy is lack of what", "I would teach it's become your own it's not just your repeating my sermons and stealing my messages but you are an example to me of me to those people in the messages and I think it's important because it's possible some of us we know the truth but we don't know how to communicate the truth or we think we know how to communicate the truth but we maybe are wrong maybe we think we're saying something clearly like my grandson will often say things and we'll look at each other like what did he say I don't know but he clearly knows so we'll say you know what did you say he'll save the exact same way like I have no clue but he sure does mine because it's makes sense you ever had someone describe something to you and in their mind it's like it's super clear to them and you're gone I have no clue I can't see what you're thinking you know but you can see it I think of these this issue when I think of church secretaries thinking for sure that they've communicated clearly this one is a they call them Bolton bloopers but ladies don't forget the rummage sale it's a good chance to get rid of those things not worth keeping around the house bring your husbands I'm sure that they did not mean what you just thought there's another one the sermon this morning Jesus walks on the water the sermon searching for Jesus another one next Thursday there will be tryouts for the choir they need all the help they can get then another about someone who was sick Barbara see remains in the hospital needs blood donors for more transfusions she's also having trouble sleeping and requests tapes of Pastor Jack's sermons not Hibbs yeah the over-60s choir will be disbanded for the summer with the thanks of the entire church in the last one missionary from Africa speaking at Calvary Memorial Church in Racine her name is belt a hear Bertha belch all the way from Africa so yeah you can think given the right information out but that doesn't mean it's coming across you have followed my teaching and my conduct you see they have to go together jesus said hey the Pharisees have seated themselves in the chair of Moses by the way that's an actual chair in the synagogue a physical chair you go over to Israel with us we'll show you he's not just this metaphorical thing it's a real place they would sit to teach and he said they've seen it themselves in the divinely appointed seat of teaching and", "that's in the synagogue's he said so do what they tell you to do but don't do as they do don't don't follow their example there later on they're hypocrites but that doesn't mean they aren't saying the right thing but you see there's something about saying something and not doing it and all of us can struggle with this we all do it's easier to say it easier said than time following Jesus right so we need to be honest about our shortcomings by the way you don't have to be perfect or sinless to be a good example you'd be a good example of an honest humble Christian who fatals and maybe that's what God's gonna call you to do is to tell your friends hey I'm not perfectly doing this but but it doesn't mean that's not true Jesus Christ is my Savior and he forgives me and I need it too you can get like redeem your shortcomings with your kids and your spouse and the people you're trying to minister to up at camp this year we played Simon Says Raymond or worship pastor played Simon Says with us and you know you hope you all played Simon Says you know Simon Says touch your hair Simon Says touch your shoulders touch your nose and of course if you touch your nose you you're out and all of you know that but here I was thinking all these kids you know I mean I guess some of them will get out some are pretty sharp and a few kids were getting out I think third round I was out like fell it's pretty stupid I'm the only adult I'm I'll sit down now you know why is that why does that game work even with adults I'll tell you what because the visual cue is more powerful than the verbal one what you see is way more effective at affecting you than what you hear that's true in life that's why we've got to live it if there's gonna be any power in what we're teaching I remember Becky nine years ago we're at a movie theater and we were we were watching it and the for some reason the projector must have gone bad and but it was still in other words there was no the lamp I think burned out we could hear the sound of the movie but there was no image and we're sitting there thinking oh they'll turn it back on the tech - no I don't think there's anybody even out there to be honest with you we're all sitting there everything finally somebody else turn the picture", "and I think sometimes there are people who are watching Christians talk about Jesus and how you they need Jesus and there are some people like hey turn the picture on show us show us it in your life don't just tell us the doctrine prove it by the way you live yourself turn the picture on put this down number two be exemplary in your purpose and your faith was on the next two areas he says you became a follower of me in purpose and faith what is our purpose well simply put as believers it's to obey the great commandment and to fulfill the Great Commission the great commandment Deuteronomy 6 jesus said the greatest commandment to love God with all your heart soul mind and strength 2nd one like it from Leviticus 19 love your neighbor as yourself its lot to obey the great commandment and to fulfill the great commission there in Matthew 28 to make disciples of all the nations that is what it ought to be is it look my purpose for a long time now is not been to make money it's to make disciples that needs to be the purpose of our lives my goal is not to become well-known it's to make him more known and famous that's why I live I pray to God that's why you live on this earth Paul says you have imitated my purpose and then he talks about imitating faith you followed by my faith now faith is a gift from God we're not saved by works but God enables us to believe but here it's talking about faithfulness and it's talking about our beliefs in God you know singing about this this morning as we were worshiping how I get excited in the presence of God and I ought to you know why because the Bible says God is a fire I don't know you I like fires - I do Amen I don't mean ones that are out of control I mean fireplace fires fires a powerful force and God compares himself to a fire the Bible says God touches the mountains and they smoke listen God doesn't show up and I didn't notice he was here in the Bible the Bible says the Mount Sinai quaked it was a flame and fire and there was a trumpet blast in other words God's presence affects even the creation you can't be in God's presence the Bible says in his presence everything says glory there is a response and that's why I think we ought to be excited when we're in the presence of God but Paul says Timothy you you", "imitated my faith you and I can grow in our faith by looking at how other people express faith how did Peter walk on the water how do you even get the idea he didn't say one day I wish I could walk on water no no he saw Jesus walking on the water and said hey if it's you let me do the same thing you're doing it's now the faith isn't imitation but it's imitating the faith of somebody else see Timothy knew about Paul and Paul in acts 16 was in jail and remember how at midnight he was praying and giving thanks and he was beaten he was bleeding but Paul was expressing a Silas that faith in God and in midnight God caused the the prison to shake and the shackles came off and a great miracle happened people got saved yeah I was thinking about this morning is in the Old Testament when the children of Israel were sent to walk around jericho repeatedly day after day for seven days remember it was only after that last day the last time around and what did they do they shouted now listen it wasn't their shout Wow so many people if you get them together and they all shout at the same time buildings will come down that's not what's happening there why do I'd say it because we know in the New Testament those walls came down by faith they really came down by God but putting their faith in God and obeying him when they shouted not until and I think sometimes what kind of you're kind of nervous about you know expressing ourselves like what's shot about all the wrong things you know all the freeway yo your gate your team gets a home run or you know whatever touchdown and yeah it's like Jesus you know it's like what's with that if there's somebody who deserves you shouting I'm not asking to be weird I'm just saying look go through the book of Revelation just look up the phrase loud voices you'll find there's a bunch of references to John hearing loud voices why is that because we express passion many times through volume that's why you yell at your kids because you really are into that you know God is worthy let me set my put it every way if there's one person who's worthy to be shouted on behalf of it's Jesus Christ he is he's worthy of that you're gonna shout in heaven you might we'll start getting used to it now faith can be imitated and Paul says Timothy you", "learned about how to do that by watching me our lives should be a testimony to people around us who are believers hey play more risk and less Trivial Pursuit with your life make your life count for the kingdom faith can be demonstrated to us how to handle money I pray if you'd know how to handle money you're demonstrated that's someone good maybe more secretive about but maybe your kids need to know how you trust God with your money disappointments you can learn a lot through another believer who's going through disappointments in their life ones are trusting a how to handle the storms you know maybe some of you are here and you're looking forward to getting married I love Mary my son is getting married next Sunday Christian I can't wait I've been praying for ya for 30 years for him well more than that yeah it's worth celebrating but here's the deal if you're looking forward to getting married don't just seek a course on marriage take one seek a couple who are godly in their marriage and say to yourself I don't want our marriage to be like that in 30 years or 40 years then hang out with people that have made it that are living it out maybe you're starting to parent will pray for you no I'm just greatest test probably in life is is to parent Titus says you can learn about parenting from each other older women teaching younger women how to care for children but all of us we need to learn how to be fathers some of us did not have great fathers as examples we have a lot of principles in the Bible that will help us but we need to see it lived out turn the picture on we need to help each other to do that we need a pattern you know when Jesus said make disciples of all the nations it's very interesting what he said next he teach them to observe all that I commanded you it's very good Sakina they teach them to memorize no teach them to see it how could they observe it in your life teach them to observe in their own lives but by seeing it in yours look some of you ladies so right I don't know that I know it's a dying art I hope it's not dead but if you learn to sew I think someone taught you by giving you help and a pattern probably by simplicity if I remember I had three sisters I do not sew I do not know how to so it's not", "even biblical that I should sew for whatever a man sows that shall he also rip this way no anyway you got a pattern that's how you learned maybe it's the only way you've you know you give without a pattern nobody said hey make me a dress make it look like that okay you know whip it up few people can do that the Lord wants you and me to grow into maturity by seeing the tore godly people around us that's why we need relationship it's true Jesus shows up a were together that's the primary reason we need community because he's here you want to be closer to Jesus hang out with the flock I'm in Song of Solomon in my devotions read chapter 1 the bride says where is it that you're pastoring your flocks because I want to go to there cuz I know wherever the flock is that's where the Shepherd will be and I don't want to get close to the Shepherd you want to get close to him stay close to each other be more with each other but that's also where we learn how to grow in our faith pattern you know when David David wanted to build God a house a temple God said you can't but thank you it was a good thing that you wanted to but no sometimes Lord has to say that to us it was good it was in your heart nothing wrong with that the intentions were good but the answer is no but here's what's gonna happen your son will build me the house kind of okay when David told Solomon his son to build the house Solomon's what how I don't know how to tell the house we God we'd like we have an old one that we're gonna replace it you know have the tabernacle never done this before dad here's what David says build it exactly according to the pattern that I'm giving you I'm giving you the pattern I'm giving you the blueprint without it you can't but you're gonna be given not only the call to do something for the Lord but I'm then I'm gonna show you how to do it when my sons were younger and living at home they were skateboarders and they loved skateboarding and going places where they could grind that skate do all the stuff right right Marilee they banged me dad build us a halfpipe in the now I even know if you know what a halfpipe is but it it you take up the whole backyard and I said I don't know how to I'm not great with construction", "anyway I said I I can't build you I don't have any way to do that and so one of my sons found in a skating magazine a little add 20 bucks for skateboard halfpipe plans and he cut it out and he gave it to me he said you don't know how to do it here you go I know that's how I said I have no plans to buy plans for a halfpipe now they want enough with a halfpipe that's a different story not by me building you need a plan if you want to do what God wants you to you and my uncle just figure it out we're called to follow an example but we're then also called to become that example you know I've noticed maybe you have to when you hang out with somebody you pick up some of their idiosyncrasies usually if you spend enough time with somebody who you respect that's an important part of it you start to kind of emulate them you don't even try I mean I have had times when I went to hear Billy Graham years ago and I loved Billy Graham and I love the way he preaches and I did not try to at all but I got up and I preached and people would I heard it myself but I didn't try to do it people come up Julie you stopped it just like Billy Graham I said I'm sorry there's no no I liked it better than you you know that was great well thanks same thing half with pasture first time I was on the radio pastures perspective you know I had people praying for me because a little nervous be on the radio to answer questions and all that and and I had all these people use having just like Chuck Smith I said I did yeah I don't know I wasn't glorious you know and I wasn't trying to emulate anybody just I guess I would listen to loud Chuck if you spent time with somebody you respect you will you what do you have to try I'll have a full session how to be a good parent you'll pick up you'll see things that they're doing you say all I want to learn to do that my my youth pastor who spent more time in my life than my senior pastor growing up because of my age and all and and the ministries were involved in I remember back in when we were first married we just had little children and we went up to his house he had five kids and and we", "watched him we watched the way he at the table they would sing a song to the Lord and I thought that's pretty cool we could do that that's easy they right before school even though it was chaotic in the house because we spent that anthro right before they would go he would he would pray with each one of them even if it was just for 30 seconds at the door you know God give him a good did God use them as we can we can do that and so we started doing things simply because we saw somebody else who did them and the effectiveness of it you can pull ager eyes faith all you want there is no copyright put this down a loving waiter who refuses to quit that's what we're to be that's the example he says there in verse Tim you followed my patience my love and my perseverance my perseverance you know it's easy to get discouraged in our Christian lives we feel like well I'm gonna share with my kids and they're just not listening they're rebelling or they're just ignoring me or trying to lead my wife but she's not interested and it can become very very discouraging as a Christian if we don't feel like we're seeing the results James says we count them blessed who endured just checkout Jobe the real story of job is not all the chapters in between it's the outcome we look at the outcome of his life and he was blessed that he stayed faithful to God not perfectly he struggled with what he said but in the end listen this a teenager had decided to quit high school saying he was just fed up with it all his father was trying to convince him to stay with it he said to him son you just can't quit he said Abraham Lincoln him quit he said all the people who are remembered in history didn't quit Abe Lincoln didn't quit Douglas MacArthur he didn't quit Elmo mccringleberry at this point whose loving and patient you know the Bible says this in first Corinthians 13 love is patient love is kind not jealous love bears all things believes all things hopes all things it in doors all things so let me ask you alright are you tempted to throw in the towel in your marriage I'm thinking about it your friends that are encouraging you to do that you thinking about throwing in the towel with your children we're one of them you say it's Bible says God give me a love that's stronger than death I have one word of", "counsel if you feel that because I felt that about my children at one point one don't don't God is testing your faith and he has more to do in that situation than he's done yet don't let God prove himself don't throw in the towel do what Jesus did gird yourself with the towel and stooped down to serve those who don't deserve it well I know that's easier for me to preach at than to do it maybe I'm preaching to myself and if you want to listen and feel free you know Winston Churchill's greatest speech was he gave one before the Parliament that everybody remembers during the war about how we'll fight will go on fighting but he actually after the war spoke at the preparatory school that he had attended as a young boy before he got there the headmaster told the student body that he was coming and that they should be listening in because he's probably one of the best that he said orator of the century he got up in front of those young men and this is what he said young gentlemen never give up never give up never never never sit down Paul says Timothy you have become an example in patience and in endurance remember what it says in Hebrews you're struggling hey get your eyes on Jesus he's the author he's the perfecter of faith who for the joy set before him endured the cross he did such hostility from sinners against himself but he made it all the way to the end aren't we still thankful that he did he is our example put this down be an example when you're hurting when you're hurting look at verse 11 and 12 he said I became or Timothy you became one who followed me in my persecutions and my sufferings such as happened at Antioch Iconium and Lystra what persecutions I endured and out of them all the Lord rescued or delivered me and then he makes this statement indeed all who desire to live godly in Christ Jesus will be persecuted here's Paul in prison he is about to be and yet he's talking about past persecutions that God delivered him out of to get the full story you we don't have time you need to read acts 13 in acts 14 he mentions three cities by the way this is where Timothy lived this is the region where Timothy lived Antioch of Pisidia Iconium and Lystra where things got worse progressively for Paul as he tried to Minister the gospel some people got saved a lot of people got angry in Antioch he got basically booted", "out of town as the Jews blaspheme he went to Iconium and there was a plot to stone him to death they just wanted to kill him he goes to Lystra and he gets stoned to death they'll eat late they leave him for dead and Paul says Timothy you know all that happened to me but the Lord delivered me out of it he said we'll deliver to you Paul you look like I because Paul still had the marks remember he would say I bear the bretton had scars from being stoned you see some many believed he died do you know what he did right after he was stoned apparently to death after the stoners left says he got up and went back into this into town didn't leave town he went back into town he'd go to Derby come back to Lystra where he was don't and he'd strengthened the disciples who had come to faith here's the guy who just been this is like your our example and use almost died I thought you were dead what have we gotten ourselves into and it says in acts 14 here's how we strengthen through many afflictions we must enter the kingdom of God this is par for the course you need to understand if they took Jesus Christ the sinless son of God filled with the love of God and they killed him and you want to be just like him guess what Jesus said in John 15 if they hated me didn't I hate you too don't be surprised Paul said I'm okay I'm okay in fact the Lord deliver me I'm still alive here and if the Lord's gonna let me die which he will he's gonna deliver me to heaven I get delivered either way it's a win-win situation for me to live Christ pure game Timothy been an example Timothy will die for his faith later on he doesn't know it yet Paul doesn't know it yet but he will die for his faith as he's put to death in Ephesus by an angry mob who will kill him how do you do when you're hurting destroy this little boy came to a pastor's house a pastor was working on some offense I think it was and little boys on his bike just watching the pastor he said hey how are you doing he was good I just sat the reason what are you doing and the little boy said odd you know the man thought he was baby trying to understand how to build and he said no he said I just want to know what a", "pastor says when he hits his thumb with a hammer just kind of watching you for that it's covered yeah jot down first Thessalonians 1 verses 5 Paul says our gospel didn't come to you in word only but also in power and in the Holy Spirit and with full conviction just as you know what kind of men we prove to be among you for your sake you also became imitators of us and Lord having received the word in much tribulation with the joy of the Holy Spirit so that you became an example to all the believers in Macedonia and okay finally put this down the Bible says taste and see the Lord is good but we need to remember we are his sample interesting to me Paul says basically Timothy remember back to those hardships that I went through but here I am I'm still following the Lord the Lord got me out of each one of those tough situations in other words yesterday's praise we prayer requests are today's today's tests are tomorrow's testimonies God's working maybe you haven't seen it happen yet doesn't mean it's not gonna happen as Christians we should expect it to get hard especially as we get closer in fact we have a problem those who desire to live godly will be persecuted Paul said it's going to be tough and that's something we shouldn't be then dismayed about when we go through it life can be hard all in itself but as Christians God is working in you he's using suffering he's using trial and he wants you and I to live in such a way that we accept and expect persecution that's easy to read but if you have lost a job if you've lost a friendship some of you have lost family friends in your own family because you're a Christian you're already living that out if you get insulted you're that bible thumper you're that prude you're that one that doesn't listen to the dirty jokes just said blessed are you and Men insult you for my name's sake the greatest reward in heaven let's have here's kind of what I want to say to you at the end of this message about our example when you and I go through the hardest of times we have an opportunity to be perhaps our greatest example I want you to think about Steven Steven is being stoned to death and yet it says he had the face of an angel when he was dying when P was being persecuted to death and then he said Lord don't lay into their charge in other words he was", "just like Jesus at his worst moment in life he reflected Christ your hardest moments in life are your greatest opportunities to reflect Jesus if you'll let them be see the fact is it's kind of like this you go down to the airport you're gonna go over to Hawaii have a good time let they tell you there's only one flight they already know it's probably not gonna be on time you're gonna have to sit near the restrooms the whole flight you're gonna sit next to a guy who should have bought two tickets and then screaming baby in the seat right in front of you no food no drink your technology is not gonna work your seat won't go back a lot of turbulence but you'll land safely or there's this other flight first class for you whatever you want to eat whatever you want to watch it's gonna be the smoothest flight you've ever been on but you'll crash just short of Honolulu guaranteed which one would you like through many afflictions we will enter the kingdom of God we're going to heaven Paul says this life is momentary light affliction I don't care how bad it gets it's nothing compared to where we're going and it's worth it it's light compared to what we deserve it's light compared to what Jesus went through and every bit of its being used to make this more into the image of Christ on behalf of our pastors and staff we want to thank you for tuning into today's video if you want to stay informed about what's going on here at Calvary Chapel you say

and we also have an Israel trip on February 14th through 22nd uh Pastor Bob along with Emir Safari with behold Israel is hosting and leading this trip really an incredible chance to have two men of God who know the word who know the scripture well to lead you through the very land the scripture was written when I went it was amazing I wanted to eat the food there which is amazing because I love

considers it as the next step for those of you who come here Sunday mornings and that's it someone encourage you if you just come here Sunday morning to come out also on a Wednesday night to see what God's doing there it's a really incredible thing the service starts even before for the service starts we serve food at 5 30 in a cafe in a cafe the courtyard there is a beautiful time we have about 100 people out there just fellowshipping sharing a meal we have a bounce house out there for the kids kids under 12 eat for free and then after that we have our service right here at seven o'clock past the ball at least the Old Testament and we also have simultaneously a children's ministry program that is just blowing up we have a youth ministry as well and Spanish Ministry so all that on Wednesday nights we really want to invite you to be a part of that so Senior Pastor Bob company I'm excited about being back we did have a great time at camp and uh we had a you know every year I um I pray for everybody's safety because we're up in Yosemite and they're kids going on Hikes and there's so I heard a group of our from Camp went", "down to a a waterfall it's not far from Camp actually you can walk there from the campground and uh they have this story that came back with an 11 year old boy named Bodie had run over to the edge of the waterfall and Fallen and we're talking um I would say about as high as at least as high as the ceiling is to the ground or higher maybe he fell over these rocks they didn't know what happened went down there's water about a foot and a half to two feet so they thought the worst Maybe he got he he landed he got up he said I don't really know what happened but not a scratch on his body not a single injury and uh yeah you know so we we renamed it it was red Red Rock Falls it's now called Bode Falls and uh we have another location we go up there that's already called Aussie Falls because of something from a previous year but uh we're renaming places there all the year but the just it was wonderful to be with God's people you know um one of the blessings I know you can't all go to camp but we try to multiply all kinds of events at this church for you to be with each other when we do a newcomers lunch we want to know you because here's the thing and I know Raymond says it all the time you're not an audience you're a family well we we believe that we want you to experience that we don't want to just tell you that um because you know families don't usually line up in rows and have someone talk for too long you know that's just not the way families are but um or or watch a watch a family gathering you don't watch a family you don't even attend a family you become a family and that's what we want once you have real relationship with each other so this service is part of that but it's not all there is God is so much more for you and there's certain things that he's only going to do in your life when you become part of the body of Christ in relationship Jesus said when two or more I'll show up I'll show up in their midst okay so there's something about the Lord having a desire to do things with us speak to us if you'll go through the gospels you'll find that Jesus chose to reveal more of himself in small groups on four different occasions I'm not teaching that this morning but it's an", "interesting thing Peter James and John on one occasion Peter James and John and Andrew were alone with Jesus from just the twelve besides the multitude and Jesus revealed more the Transfiguration the healing of jairus's daughter the what's going to happen in the future okay I am teaching on it but the fact is the Lord is more that he wants to reveal to you that's not going to happen in the big group we need to be here we're going to teach the word of God we're going to worship together we can do those things a big group but the family needs to be hanging out together more so I want to encourage you to take advantage especially as the summer is winding down to to be a part of whatever we're doing couple things coming up specifically I want you to know about we have a baptism and when when I announce that don't think oh good some people are getting baptized I'm happy I remember mine baptism one of the images in the Bible of baptism is a person is being added to the body of Christ did you know that we think of death and Resurrection that's one image from Romans 6 but the Bible says in Colossians we are actually being baptized into the body of Christ and so the water becomes a picture of God's people and we're adding them and the idea is as the Believers we're there to people that have come to Christ and have made that decision so we want as many of you who can come to come this next baptism will be down at Pirate's Cove some of you have been there I think we have an image of that yeah that's what that's amazing Place uh how many of you saw the movie The Jesus Revolution I want you to see it again so the Wednesday before this is August 20th will be there the Wednesday before that Sunday we are going to show that film on a Wednesday night here and we want you to come you say I've already seen it so have I I'll be here anyway I've seen it more than you but I I want you to pray about inviting someone who doesn't know the Lord or somebody who's backslidden or Fallen away bring them pray for them that God might use this film to stir within them to repent and come back to him and maybe for some of them even to be baptized that next Sunday so that acts that's the 16th of August Wednesday night's coming up that's the movie from", "6 30. we're doing it early because it's a two-hour Movie 6 30 to 8 30 and then the baptism and the beach day will be Sunday after service on the 20th so put that on your calendar and I hope you can join us for that and then guys there's a men's Retreat coming up in September I don't have time to talk much about it this morning other than go to the app Saturday time that we'll have with Pastor easy like you'd open your Bibles now to First John chapter 4. first John chapter 4 beginning in verse 7. so hopefully you have your Bible if not they'll put the words on the screen but first John 4 as we continue our verse by verse study through the New Testament John writes this beloved let us love one another for love is from God and everyone who loves is born of God and knows God the one who does not love does not know God for God is love by this the love of God was manifested in us that God has sent his only begotten son into the world that we might live through him in this is love not that we love God but he loved us he sent his son to be the propitiation for beloved if God so loved us we also ought to love one another no one has seen God at any time but if we love one another God abides in us his love is perfected in us and by this we know that we abide in him that he and he and us because he has given us of his Spirit let's pray father we want to do more than read and study this scripture we want to live it we want to invite you to just do more than teach us about the love of God we ask that you would cause us to love you and each other in ways we have never yet experienced even as Christians we thank you that your Holy Spirit actually produces agape love we can't make it this world knows nothing of it but Lord your people are to have this experience because it evidences that they're really saved and it evidences it to a lost world that can't find it so I pray that you would remind us of that give us a desire to love like you loved us and then give us the opportunity to do it in Jesus name amen well I've entitled the message where Is The Love Yes Roberta Flack wrote a song about that some of you are hearing that", "go through your mind but uh the reason I'm using that title is because John is telling Christians how they can know they're saved and remember we've already studied this in this book how you can know you're saved well one of the things is you you obey the Commandments of God you want to obey him you don't have to you want to but another attribute of a True Believer is they have a new love that they never had before and it's for God's people not just the love for God but a love for other people put this down God's love then is our personal confirmation of our Salvation or attestation or validation you can use any of those words we um some of us grew up singing this song I think our youth group has started singing in the last year but maybe some of you know the song We Are One in the spirit how many of you have ever heard that song okay there's a line in that song that says and they'll know we are Christians by yes they'll know we are Christians by our Lord remember Jesus said by this shall all men know you're my disciples if you have love for one another it's the ultimate apologetic to a lost world and while that's true the world will know that we are believers in fact Jesus did you know that Jesus has you on his prayer list Oh no just mean that metaphorically because his prayer list is found in the Gospel of John chapter 17 where he prays what we call as high Priestly prayer he didn't call it that but we call it that it's a whole chapter of Jesus praying and he prays repeatedly for his disciples that they would all be one as he and and the father are one and then he specifically prays for you you said what do you mean for me he prays for those who will come to believe in him as a result of their word that's you that's me we came to believe in Jesus as a result of the Gospel of Jesus Christ coming to us and he prays for us and he prays the same thing that we would all be one with a Unity that would cause a lost world to stand up and take notice there's something different about us he said when you guys love each other when you're one the way you ought to be the world will realize you can't find that outside of Christ and it's not just a confirmation to the world that you're saved it's a confirmation to us and", "we'll know we are Christians by our love we might change the song put this down God's love Among Us Reveals His Life within us put in the word among and within and look at verse seven beloved let's Agape one another for love is from God he's the sole source and everyone who agapes is born of God and knows God and I use the word Agape specifically because we use that word love and we just kind of say if you're a loving person then you're you know the Bible says God is love but it never says love and this world has a complete misunderstanding of love in terms of what God offers this world has something far less we've talked about it there's erotic love sex you know back in the 60s there were hippies and others who would hold signs and say Make Love Not War you know protesting the Vietnam War Make Love Not War as though something love is something you can make well what they mean is have sex but that's not what the Bible's talking about when it talks about love now that's a form of love there is a Greek word that talks about erotic love that word Eros is not in the Bible not because God didn't create sex Regenesis of course he did the two will become one flesh he created it man Hugh Hefner did not create it it's a beautiful gift when it's used in the right place in the right context very destructive outside of it it's like a fire fires can be very nice when they're in con you know they're controlled burn when it's in his right place it's a great gift when it's not in the right place it is absolutely destructive that's erotica but the Bible also speaks of human love or or mutual love it's the word phileo uh the word group includes words that speak of friendship um of companionship or mutual love I love you because you are beautiful or I love you because you love me that's what the world understands you know I think it was Seals and Crofts who had a song called Closer to You In the words of the song where darling if you want to be close if you want me to be closer to you get closer to me if you want me to love you and love only you then love only me in other words ah this is the love song if you want me to love you Ben it's real easy you love me and I will reciprocate well the world understands that kind of", "love we want to be loved and we want to have a mutual relationship that's human or friendship you know a companionship but it's a it's a conditional love I'll love you if I love you because and if you don't that's it I don't love you anymore well this is talking about a totally different kind of love and we've talked about it so I don't want to continue forever just talking about the kind of love but it's important that you understand what John is saying this kind of love that is sacrificial it's kind of a love that's not based on condition but is based on volition I'm making a decision to love even somebody who's on Lovely this is the kind of love that God wants not only for us to enjoy from him but to give to each other so God's love Among Us Reveals His Life within us you might say love this kind of love is the birthmark of a child of God I've shared before that I've had the privilege of having four of my grandchildren live in my home and uh it was they don't live there anymore but for about three and a half years and it turned out that my youngest grandson from that family was just a baby when he moved in so I had that privilege of kind of getting to know him and spell spend extra time with him anybody who's been in our church for any like the time knows how often I bring him up I haven't done it for a while giving you a break I have other grandchildren some people got really worried I Pastor Bob you do have their grandkids you should talk about them well I'm not here to just talk about my grandkids but I have a special unique relationship with Jeffrey who's now six doesn't live in my home anymore but we have a lot of wonderful early experiences but one of the things I would ask him is he would grow up in my home uh and he would hear my stories of because you know kids grow up he would ask me questions about what was my first job and then he would find out I used to be a policeman he would want to know all about that he'd come to church and hear me preach he knows I'm a pastor so I just happened to ask him along the way what would you like to be when you grow up well he didn't have a lot of choices he didn't know a lot of professions so he said well let's see", "the first job I want to have is I want to I want to work at a gas station it was my first job and I had to say you know you don't really have guys that pump gas anymore and check oil I guess you weren't beyond the cash register because that's the first job I want I want to work at a gas station and I go yeah then what well then I want to be a policeman because that was my second job and then I'm gonna be a pastor you know and of course any any father or mother of the room know that your children your grandchildren early on they might they might not have a lot of choices but if they love you they kind of would like to do maybe what you did jot it down Ephesians chapter 5 verses one and two here's what Paul says therefore be imitators of God as beloved children walk in love just as Christ also loved you and gave himself up for you an fragrant Aroma in other words if you're a child of God there should be this attributed you these I want to be like my Father in Heaven I want to be merciful like he's been merciful to me I desire to reflect who he is like father you know you cannot look at someone and by just looking at them physically see if they're saved but there ought to be circumstantial there ought to be proof and agape love you might say is the proof of eternal life now there are two terms used in our text to describe somebody who is actually saved it says they know God and they've been born of God they know him and the word in the Greek speaks of a knowledge by experience not but they have a personal relationship Abby konosco speaks of I've had an experience with God I know him and then that they have actually had a spiritual birth let me ask you this does that describe you because I meet people who come to this church all the time and it doesn't yet and I love that because I get a chance to tell them being a Christian is more than believing the right things about Jesus from the Bible remember we've talked about this so many times the demons believe all the right stuff they're not saved James says you you can believe in God and if it doesn't affect your life you have a dead faith faith without works is dead and the demons know there's a God so that doesn't save you just knowing", "the right things saying the Apostles Creed or the Nicene Creed never saved me every week that I did it in the Lutheran Church it was all true God would later use it what I did receive Christ but there must come a time in your life where you come to know him personally you need to meet him Jesus said you need to receive him have you done that and have you been born of God because that's the description of a true child of God and then when you do you experience his love first of all for you before you have love for anybody else you have to receive his love you can't give what you don't receive you've never received it you can't give it away you won't have it agape love though is a giving love remember what John 3 16 says for God so loved the world he what what he gave let's put it this way a giving sacrificial giving love reveals in us the Living God inside of us now loving with this kind of love is not a learned behavior there's lots of behaviors that are learned but biblically this one is by other people you might experience love from someone else but they can't teach you to love somebody else look birds are not taught to fly they just do fish live in schools but they don't attend classes on how to swim it just comes naturally jot down first Thessalonians 4 9 you understand why I'm saying this here's what Paul says now as to the love of the Brethren loving each and he doesn't use phileo he uses Agape as to Agape each other with sacrificial love you have no need for anyone to for you yourselves are taught by God to one another in other words it's a natural Supernatural thing it's kind of like loving a brother or sister even kids who can be stingy and selfish when they have a new brother or sister being born they're very protective and they love that child because they're part of their family it's just it just happens and so it is one of the revelations that a child of God has is they start having a new love for God and for other believers you might say it this way the love of God is God wrought the spirit of God creates it within us remember the Bible says the fruit singular the fruit of the spirit is what it's Agape it's what he does it's the evidence that you're really a child of God some of you", "many of you may be as parents or some of you even who have been in our church for many years know the Sunday school teacher who attended here and still does for the last 30 years Bill Tomlin Bill Tomlin has been ministering in our children's ministry for three decades and was not long ago diagnosed with he's watching if you're watching right now Bill love you but I was with him yesterday he's on hospice he doesn't have long and was with him and his wife and just went over to say hi and see how I could pray for him and um and I you know I had asked the Lord on the way over to visit him I I said Lord what do you want me to say um I I asked that by the way all the time I even asked you before I get up and speak in front of you even though you go really you ask us yeah I asked and and I I felt like the Lord wanted me to ask Bill a question and I told Bill as I was sitting there with him and his wife and some others I said now bill I got to tell you this is an awkward question I I really think God wants me to ask it and I've never asked anybody in your situation this question in my life he said well what's the question I said Bill what is the best part about he said you mean other than going to heaven I said yeah I'm not talking about that I know that's the best part of after your I go maybe you're going to say the best part of dying is not but I that's not he laughed but is there a Best part for you and with tears in his eyes he actually picked up his cell phone he said it is all the love that I have coming in from people at the church the body of Christ telling me how God has used me in their life and and the gift that I've been in their life it's just like this ocean of love that's pouring out he goes I can't even describe it it's overwhelming and that is exactly what God wants us to understand not just when someone's dying or when we're dying but he wants us to live in this place where we are experiencing the love of God whatever you're going through that you're hurting about the struggles you have with forgiving other people the love of God has everything to do with healing that remember Paul will say this", "in First Corinthians now abide faith hope and love all three are important they're Christian virtues but the greatest of these is love look faith in the Ephesians is our shield for our hope is not just our helmet it's also the anchor in the book of Hebrews for the storms that we go through but Solomon said this about love God's love it's stronger than death it doesn't just Outlast death it overcomes death so Paul says in Romans what shall separate us from the love of God you name it it can't that's why Jesus came to die for our sins and overcome death nothing is stronger than the love of God and that's what every single one of us needs whether we know it or not put this down the Loveless however are spiritually lifeless according to verse eight look at that the one who does not have agape love and does not love other people does not know for God is love jot down Ephesians 4 verses 17 through 19. Paul said this this I say therefore and I affirm together with the Lord he's talking to Christians you walk no longer just as the unbelievers the Gentiles walk they walk in the futility of their minds they're darkened in their understanding they're excluded from the life of God because of the ignorance that is in them because of the hardness of their heart and they having become Talus have given themselves over to sensuality for the practice of every kind of impurity with greediness Paul is talking to Believers and he's saying that's not you anymore don't don't live like the the world lives the way you used to live who have no love inside of their heart the writer to the Hebrews the Hebrew Christian says this in chapter 3 and verse 13 encourage one day after day lest any of you be hardened by the deceitfulness of sin even believers who have been loved by God can have their hearts become hard if they're not careful by not having a healthy relationship with each other I think there are multitudes of people on this planet who are very religious who have never been regenerated I think it's possible there's a handful maybe more here in this room listening to my message online who are religious they go to church religiously every week they don't miss it but they've never been regenerated they don't have God's life in them remember that's what tripped up Nicodemus Nicodemus was a very nice guy well-respected guy he knew the Bible he taught the Bible it was one of the good Pharisees on the", "Sanhedrin who didn't want Jesus to be crucified if you remember the story what tripped him up was this issue about being born again remember Jesus said except you'd be born again you will never enter the kingdom of heaven and Nicodemus didn't understand how can I be burning out I'm an old man I get back on my mother's womb and go hello you know how do I do she said you're a teacher in Israel and you don't understand these things that which is born of the flesh is the flesh your mom can only give you a physical existence you need to be born of the spirit of God you see there needs to be a new birth in you that's what it took for Nicodemus to become Saint Nick was to be born again now God is in the business thankfully of transforming religious and by the way Wicked people too into regenerate people he's in the business of turning prideful angry hurting and hurtful people on loving people into Hubble loving people even Jesus's followers at times you see them kind of break out into fleshly desires remember James and John are with Jesus he's heading to Jerusalem that's toward the end of his ministry you think by now it would have sunk in but the Samaritans followers into town because they the Samaritans knew they are Jews and they're heading to Jerusalem and they didn't like that that was wrong in their minds because they worshiped elsewhere and so James and John get offended for Jesus by the way you always be careful when you're getting offended for Jesus and you would decide to defend Jesus he doesn't need your help but Peter learned that lesson in the garden remember but James and John come to Jesus with this idea would you like us to call down fire on the Samaritans and again it's not like it's not biblical because Elijah did that in the Old Testament and do you remember what Jesus said you know not what Spirit you're of in other words you think that's the spirit of God's righteous indignation in you and you're wrong even as Believers even as followers of Jesus we can deceive ourselves into being so angry at sin but we're not reflecting Christ at all she said I didn't come to destroy I claim to save them read about Saul he was a Pharisee he said as far as the law was concerned he was blameless he would look like a righteous guy he lived it out but he was full of Pride and Prejudice he had a hatred with those Jews who had become", "Christians who believed in what he thought was a dead Messiah and he hated he wanted them arrested and he wanted them punished he was there when the first man that was martyred for his faith faith was put to death he agreed jot down Titus 3 and verse 3. here's Paul giving his own testimony about what he was like before he was saved he says we also once were foolish ourselves we were disobedient we were deceived we were enslaved to various lusts and Pleasures we spent our life in Malice and envy hateful and hating one another from the outside you might have thought oh he's a holy religious but Paul said if you knew the old me you wouldn't have liked me and I wouldn't have liked you I was a dangerous person to be around but this is the same man that wrote first Corinthians 13. this is the first man who said I would give up my salvation for the Jewish people this is a man who was so empowered by the love of God he would say in second Corinthians now the love of Christ controls my life and he told us why it's because of what he experienced he said this in Galatians 2 20. I'm crucified with Christ nevertheless I live yet not I but Christ lives in me and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by faith listen in the Son of God who loved me and delivered himself up for me he personalized the cross what Jesus did wasn't just for the world it was for me because of that now the love of Christ controls my life it affects me I need to live for the one for me jot down John 5 verses 39 through 42 Jesus is talking to the Jews who are very self-righteous and believed in the law of Moses and believed in the Bible and he said this to them you searched the scriptures which is not a bad thing that's a good thing but he said you search the scriptures because you think that in the scriptures you have eternal life but it is the scriptures that bear witness of me all about the Messiah you are unwilling however to come to me in Saving faith that you may have life I don't receive Glory from men but I know you and you do not have what the love of God in yourselves oh you're religious or you believe the right things but you don't have God's life in you and you don't have God's love in you those two go together the love of God", "reveals the life of God in a Believer put this down letter B on your outline God's love has a powerful manifestation it creates a confirmation that I'm saved but it also has a powerful manifestation look at verse 9 by this the love of God was manifested in or Among Us that God sent his only begotten son into the world so that we might live through him that's Christmas that's the Incarnation God sent his son in this is love not that we love God but that he loved us and secondly he sent his son not just to be the Incarnation but to be the propitiation for our sins Gary Chapman wrote a book it's become very popularized maybe you've heard of it it's about the five love languages how many of you have heard of this people all like to read and say what is my love language I don't know we always like to think about ourselves and study ourselves you know we have plenty of time for that anyway um you might want to find out what other people's are but um you know is it is it words of affirmation is it can I just tell you something God has a love language God has a love language according to the it's it's giving it's Gifts of giving there's no question that's what the Bible clearly teaches you know it's funny I think my daughter-in-law Haley she's our children's ministry director and they go to Camp every year uh her and my son Christian I think she's convinced My love language must be uh a a year ago we all go up a day early to get stuff ready for camp and we were at rallies that's a supermarket in Oakhurst just outside of the camp and we were buying stuff and I I had the cart and I uh they had some stuff we bought some stuff but I realized Becky had picked up some pistachio nuts for me because she knows I like them to snack on and I did that week only to find out she said Bob I didn't buy those I go what she goes no that's it it's Christians and Haley's I go well they're so I said I felt I told her I said Haley I am so sorry she said um that's not a big deal I said so I went out and I bought another bag and I had them in my room and and all week I was planning to give it to him and then I ate those two this year we were we went up together to", "Oakhurst and we rented a Airbnb the night before we could get into camp and she presented me with a Costco size I said I can't eat all those I didn't I didn't I gave about half of them back before I did but um Romans 5 8 here's what Paul says about love God demonstrates manifests his own love his agape love toward us in that while we were yet sinners Christ died for us verse 9 and 10 teach this Jesus was sent to give us and he was also sent to save us from both of those things are true put this down to understand God's love it must be first of all cross-examined 9 he was sent that we might have life now let's be real clear about this all of us are born we're conceived with the Bible uses two Greek words for life in the New Testament there's the word bios b-i-o-s we get our word biology the study of life that's talking about physical life you got that from conception not from birth and be happy to show you scripturally why I know that you became an eternal soul from conception from Psalm 51 sometime if you like but the fact is you two Greek words for life and that's a gift from God God will you in your mother's word biology the study of life but that's not Eternal not physical life when Jesus said I came that you might have life and have it abundantly he didn't use the word bios he used the word Zoe if you ever know someone named Zoe that comes from this word in Greek when you said I am the way the truth and Fades away I am the life he's talking about the life from God the life that only God can give he's talking about a spiritual not just existence but a eternal life does not begin after you die and you come back to life and that's you start eternal life eternal life will never begin for you after you die unless it begins before you die that's John 17 3 this is eternal life that they may know the only true God in Jesus Christ to me is sent so do you have eternal life I know you've got biological life otherwise you'd be laying down a little different Jesus came that you might be given spiritual life it's been said and I think I love this phrase when you come to Christ he may or may not add years to there is no promise in Scripture that you're going to wind up living to be 120 or 140 or whatever", "if you want to be just like Jesus he died at 33 by the way FYI but he lived a full life coming to Christ you may or may not have years added to your life but you will definitely have life added to your years you will know why you exist you will have purpose you'll be satisfied you see so many people I think are kind of like that old song they're looking for love in all the wrong places they want to get it in their family from their spouse from their girlfriend from their boyfriend from their parents from their children from their friends for they're looking for a satisfying love and they never really get it oh they made taste of it but it's short-lived remember what Jesus said to the woman at the well who had come to draw water he said the person who drinks from that well will thirst again she knew that well she'd have to come every day to get water but anyone will drink of the water that I'll give Living Water he said will never thirst again she said what what now you got to understand she didn't go oh you're talking about the Holy Spirit John 7. it wasn't written yet she wasn't talking about the Holy Spirit Living Water meant spraying water okay and they didn't know of any spring that was there there was a well where do you get that water I don't want to have to come here on a practical level I really don't want to have to come here and drink and besides I'm not really well known in the community that's why I come at noon when it's so hot and nobody else remember Jesus said go call your husband we'll we'll have a conversation I'm not no but you're shocking up he didn't say it quite that way but he said you've had several husbands the guy you're living with now he's not your husband whoa how'd you know that you must be a prophet Jesus reveals to her who he is I am the Messiah because she said we'll figure all the stuff out he said here I am she drops the bucket she couldn't care less about water anymore she wants to bring other people to meet this guy who told her she said everything she had and her life begins listen that picture though you drink from that well yeah you'll you'll be satisfied for today for a few minutes sin is pleasurable for a season and even if the thing that you're wanting isn't sinful maybe it is to be", "fulfilled in a relationship all of us but you will find that none of it was designed to satisfy you the way that God Alone can satisfy you blaze Pascal the great French mathematician used to say there's a god-shaped void like a puzzle piece that's missing from your life and it only fits Jesus Christ he's the only one that'll fit it and you can shove everything you want to try to avoid it but you'll never ever fill it until you come to Christ and at that point you'll realize Lord you don't just want to satisfy that desire in me you want to give me the ability to love other people who are looking for love and all the wrong places again put this down in your to understand God's love it must be cross-examined and then be a Channel of God's love not merely a container in verse 11 if God so loved us we also ought to love now I need to take a moment and remind you that this is one of John's favorite you don't have to if you don't want to but I've circled the word beloved in my Bible in verse 7 and verse 11. in our he says it twice in this book he says it five times just turn back to chapter 3 verse 1. and verse 2. he introduces the subject of the love of being a part of our experience and demonstrating that we're really saved by saying this behold that's King James or how great a love the father has bestowed on us that we should be called sons of God and such we are for this reason the world does not know us because it did not know him then he says it beloved now are we the children he will go on to use that phrase in the next part in verse 21 again he calls beloved and then in chapter 4 verse 1 beloved and then in our text twice beloved as though he's trying to get something across you need to know who you are instead of it just people that's just kind of a Bible beloved it's no he's trying to tell you who you already are as a Christian part of the problem that we as Christians faces we really calls us what God calls us this came across my computer this last week it was a picture of a dog I want you to see it so that's a man no no it really is that that is that is not a real dog that's a man in a Kali costume an expensive one cost fourteen thousand", "there's a video of him this is he's in he's in Japan and uh here's what he said since I was a child I always dreamed and wanted to be a dog I wanted to be an animal so I have become a dog Kali was my favorite one and so there's there's a video you can go in in someone's taking him for a walk down the sidewalks in Japan and people are kind of looking at big and uh it definitely looks like a dog but little dogs are coming up smelling and running away they can smell it you know he ain't figging them out he goes by the name I think it should have been Loco but um he's he won't admit who he is he won't go the man won't go on screen because he says I'm Afra I want to stay Anonymous he said because I'm afraid that my friends might think I'm a little weird and I thought the really strange word in that is little now I don't point that out to make fun of him but I I was thinking about this what the Bible says what happens when men move away from God historically they valuing and even worshiping things that are not God here's what the Bible says in Romans 1 professing to be wise they become fools they exchange the glory of The Incorruptible God for an image in the form of corruptable man and a birds and a four-footed animals and crawling creatures now you say well he's not worshiping and he just wants to be a dog for a man or a woman to want to be something that they weren't created not just transgender we're talking trans when God created You In His Image to glorify I don't want to be that I want to be this I'd rather be this something is really messed up that would be like a butterfly going man I wish I was a caterpillar that would be makes no sense now why do I tell you all that because what John is trying to say is do you know who you are do you know that as a Believer there's nobody else in all of history and the who has more of an experience with the love of God than you should have you are the Beloved of God I you almost need to make that word beloved a command let yourself experience the love of God Jude says the secret of the Christian Life is stay keep yourself in the love you'll never be able to love other people unless you do stop thinking you're going to generate", "it out of obligation or somehow just pretend and fake your way through it it doesn't work that way jot down Isaiah 62 and verse 4 Listen to What God Says to his people after he brought them through the Babylonian captivity and they were destroyed he said never again will you be called forsaken that's what you're thinking of yourself now or rejected your new name will be God's delight and God's Bride for the Lord Delights in you and will claim you as his bride can I say to you even as Believers maybe some of you are here and your past should not define you the way you view yourself not only the past sins that used to control your life I hate it when somebody says well I'm an alcoholic I'm a recovering alcohol and I get it you need to face the addiction that you had but the Bible says to Christians such were some of you you're not anymore Christ changed you stop identifying yourself because of the sin you used to commit that's not asking you to say I'm up ex fornicator I'm an ex we don't care about what you were we care about what you are give glory to who you are in Christ and the power that he has to change you but the love of God should change your view of yourself if you do not sense the love of God and you call yourself a Christian something's wrong why because God has demonstrated his love historically in a way that will never be surpassed in all of eternity he's already done it what you need to do is let it sink in to you personally how much he loved you and how much he still loves you now put this down number three God's love alone reveals God to a in verse 12 John says no one has seen God at any time that's interesting he said the same thing in the Gospel of John chapter 1 verse 18. no man has ever he said well I think that's not right I mean there was Jesus Jesus revealed the father but did not come except in human form remember when Moses said I want to see your glory god said can't do that it would destroy you and every appearance of God in the Old Testament was a theophany a manifestation of God the burning bush the pillar of cloud the pillar of fire these were manifestations of God or Christopher he's Christ being the word of God revealing him you see the visions of God but the essence of", "who God is he's Spirit John 4 those who worship us worship him you can't see but that doesn't mean it's not real remember what Jesus said to John to in John 3 to Nicodemus he said you know you're trying to understand being born again he said it's like the wind can't see wind but you can definitely see the effect of the wind it's real even though you can't see it it's like electricity Jesus didn't use this illustration but we can you can't see it but you stick your finger in a light socket I did when I was younger I shouldn't have anyway you will definitely know it's real no one can see God Jesus said to Philip if you've seen me you've seen the father he meant you have seen the character Jesus is not the father they're not the same person they're unified in their character and purpose don't make that mistake that's a heresy called modalism that the father became the son the Bible doesn't teach that Jesus wasn't praying to himself when he said father forgive them they know not what they do okay I will that's he's not talking to himself in the can't see God and Jesus while he was here he is gone and now John is making if the world is going to recognize that there is a God how is it going to happen if we love one another God lives in us and his love is perfected By Us in other words the world will see that God is real now Jesus hung on a cross to fulfill scripture the Bible says that he would be pierced Through the Bible said that he who hangs on a tree is cursed and he came to accept our curse he accepted the guilt the the the shame the nakedness Adam and Eve experience when their eyes were open remember he came to experience all the thorns on his brow thorns and thistles will shall yield for you the ground is cursed Jesus came to experience that for us to experience God's Wrath and to allow God to forgive us by Jesus paying for I think it's good to think of the cross the cross has this member that goes up and down vertically Jesus reconciled a holy God and sinful man that's what he came to do he came to be the propitiation the one who satisfies God's Wrath and makes us acceptable to God you know that but I love the fact that the cross reaches out to the left and the right Paul says I'm praying for you church at Ephesus that you would", "know the dimensions of God's love because it goes out in every single Direction and Jesus on the cross demonstrates this you might say as it goes out to the left and it goes to the right Jesus broke down the barrier wall between God and man in the Bible it says that he took down curses that were written the laws that we had broken on the cross he tore it down by paying the punishment but he also came to die to reconcile man to man that otherwise would never be reconciled jot down Galatians 3 28. listen to how Paul puts it there is neither Jew nor Gentile or Greek there is neither slave nor free man there is neither male nor female for you are all one in Christ Jesus now what is Paul talking about he is talking about the unity that God intends to dwell in the church Christ reconciled you to a holy God but his intention is for that love to thou be demonstrated in your life between you and people that are very different from you all the Dividing Walls Paul talks about this in Ephesians and he uses actually the analogy of a temple wall when you would go into the temple if you were a gentile you could only get into the court of the Gentiles that was the outermost Court if you were not a Jew you couldn't get any closer to the presence of God beyond the court of the Gentiles there's a wall that set upon pain of death you come in here if you're not a Jew and there was the court of women then the court of men and the court of the priests and then finally the sanctuary where the high priest would go into the holy of holies but if you were a gentile you weren't going any closer than that wall and Paul uses this analogy that Christ has torn down the dividing wall between people that otherwise would be divided that is to be our experience you see listen I don't know what you think because I often asked you but I'm going to tell you what I think about the reality of the days that we this world will always suffer from it has from the beginning of time and it will till the end of time but it doesn't mean it should ever be found in the the remedy for racism is not education is certainly not legislation and it's definitely not reparations it's spiritual regeneration because in Christ all Races become equal the ground is level at the cross how about class division", "in Christ there's neither slave nor free man those were the class divisions in Paul's day those were the rich the free men and most people were slaves who were owned they had nothing but in Christ those distinctions didn't matter do you know in the early church slaves sometimes would be the ones that were getting up and preaching and teaching the Bible and their Master would be sitting in front of them and during the service the slave was in charge of this it was an amazing thing because everything was turned around you know in the early church when the spirit of God came on the church they started selling what they had so there wouldn't be a needy person among them and people even the non-saved Jews recognized they had favored with the unbelievers because of the way the spirit of God was changing the way they treated each other they started loving each other in a way that other Jews were I think the cure for class division between rich and poor is not redistribution of wealth by the government of man huh it's the love of God filling God's people with the Holy Spirit and surrendering to the government and the leading of God in our lives that's the evidence that the spirit of God is controlling us and filling us even the most original profound and by the way there were only two is no obstacle to the power of unity in there's neither male nor female do you remember in the New Covenant in the coming of the Holy Spirit as Peter stands up on the day of Pentecost he says this is that which Joel said in the last days God says I'll pour out my spirit upon All Flesh and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy your young men shall see Visions your old men shall dream dreams and he said even your handmaidens even the the slave little girls they'll be prophesying prophecy was the highest gift in the church First Corinthians 14 seek to prophesy God can use anybody and he's going to use everybody equally so Peter he says to husbands hey you treat your wives with respect live with your wife in an understanding way he said lest your prayers will be cut off he said treat them as fellow heirs co-equal Heirs of the grace of the kingdom of God you see in Christ there aren't these divisions that humanly and naturally come to us think about Jesus's disciples now some of them were fishermen but not all of them Judas was no fishermen and several the others were no fishermen", "one of the Disciples of Jesus who wrote one of the gospels is a guy named Matthew you know him as Levi he was a tax collector remember the tax collectors were traitors to the Jews the Jews were controlled by the Romans and oppressed by the Romans and the Romans hired Jews to get taxes from Jews and not the good guys did it well Matthew that's how he lived his life he got Wealthy by taking taxes and by the way most of the tax collectors rip people off remember Zacchaeus when he repented he said I have to give back because I've been stealing for a long time but Matthew gets up from his money changing table and he follows Jesus but that was his past background working for do you know one of the other lesser-known disciples of Jesus was a man named Simon not Simon Peter but Simon in King James he's called Simon the Canaanite but most translations better translate Simon the zealot now when you read that you might go oh he must have been really on fire for the Lord oh no that's not what that word means Zealot was actually a political party among Jews before he was saved I'm sure they were committed to the violent overthrow of the Roman government they hated Romans they killed Romans the Sakari if you know anything about this had knives and they would sneak in at night and kill Roman guards and also sympathizers with the Romans like Matthew and these are two of the guys that Jesus would bring close to himself and close to each other and those animosities that had been there politically in their life for years and years and years were brought down by the love of Jesus Christ and I believe that's what God's intention is for us I I say in Christ there is whatever it is there in Christ there is no there are and Democrat Christians well I agree no they're just Christians you're not a black Christian or an Asian Christian don't don't put any word before Christian don't there's no word that modifies Christ you're a Christian who happens to be black or white or whatever but those things are not the important things anymore that's that's not distinguishing you it's Christ who distinguishes you and what you have in common with other Christians is way more do you remember what Paul says what does a Believer have in common with a non-believer that's second Corinthians 6. now that's a rhetorical question he doesn't mean what do you have in common with your non-Christian friends", "you go well actually we're both into it you know old cars we're restoring them and we like Checkers no we they're the point is nothing for eternity when you look at what you have in common with unbelievers in terms of your destiny and Eternity and your experience especially you have nothing zero but a Believer has everything in common with another believer I don't care how different they are than you because they've been born by The Same Spirit they love the same Lord and they're going to the same Heaven amen when I became a police officer I was in the police academy Golden West and I horrible tragedy had happened Whittier PD I didn't work with for Whittier PD but one of the detectives narcotics detectives had been involved with a bus that didn't go downright turned out to be a shootout and an outlaw motorcycle gang was in a shootout with this detective and some other police as a result some of the bad guys got killed and so did uh Whittier Detective and so here I am in the police academy I haven't graduated yet or done my first day on the job all of us went to this funeral up in Whittier huge if you've ever been to how many of you have been to a police officer's funeral then or you've watched them on TV they're huge cops come from all over the state I mean it's a big deal to honor those who have fallen and uh I remember hearing the story of what happened and in the academy we talked a lot about Outlaw biker gangs we had gangs in our in our communities but but Outlaw Biker games would come through these communities from time to time just for officer safety and so I was always particularly aware of that years later I'm working for another Police Department I'm working for Placentia PD and I'm in uniform and I have a marked unit and I'm I'm on a break and I need to pick up a birthday card I think it was might have been an anniversary card for my wife Becky and so there was one Christian bookstore in Placentia actually wasn't Implement she was kind of next attention so I pulled in there a little tiny thing and uh I walked into this little bookstore and I hear this motorcycle and it is loud and I glance out the window and I this isn't just like the kind of motorcycle you know it's not a gold wings this is a biker I mean he's flying his colors the whole thing and", "I'm thinking to myself okay great why is he here and then he walked into the store and I thought it's going to rob this place I mean I have my police car outside you know and I'm just being very you know pretending to be looking at the cards ready you know and this guy this biker guy walks around and he starts coming down the aisle to where where I am and I look up at him and he looks at me and we are just the antithesis I mean we have on opposite sides of the law as far as everyone's turn on the opposite sides of everything and I look up at him and he smiles and I realize he's a brother in the Lord I before we even said anything I just gave him a big hug and he gave me a big hug his name was biker James and it's funny because at that point this church had just started in my home I was a brand new pastor but I was still a cop guess what he was also a pastor he pastored a biker church not far from there and we sat and just shared about our testimonies and it was so awesome to watch how the Lord just could bring down walls barriers prejudices can I tell you something that's still true the love of God can change your heart for people around you that aren't very lovable in the body of Christ and for that matter outside the body of Christ you know we're going to end with a song but before we do we'll have the worship team come I want to read to you something I mentioned before it used to be a half sheet on the back of our table and we we had stolen it from not stolen it really but we borrowed it the words from Calvary Chapel of Costa Mesa and it seemed like every Calvary Chapel I visited no matter where I went and when I traveled on Sundays I'd always go to a Calvary Chapel and they always had the same half sheet because uh I think you can't really improve upon it I think we should bring it back it was describing for somebody who's visiting the church what is Calvary Chapel all about and it did it very simply with these words Calvary Chapel has been formed as a fellowship of Believers in the lordship of Jesus Christ our Supreme desire is to know Christ and be conformed to His Image by the power of the Holy Spirit we are not a denominational Church nor", "are we opposed to denominations as such only to their over emphasis of the doctrinal differences that have led to the division of the body of Christ we believe the only true basis of Christian Fellowship is Christ's agape love which is greater than any differences we possess and without which we have no to claim ourselves Christians would you bow your heads with me Father there are who you're touching with your spirit saying you need this you need an experience with the love of you call yourself a Christian but what Jesus said to those Pharisees he would say to you you don't have the love of God in you but you won't come to me that I might give it to you Lord would you knock on doors Lord for those that are struggling with forgiving somebody who has hurt them would you help us to see that Your Love Takes the initiative Lord you didn't wait for us to seek you you loved us first and would you give us a love that takes the initiative to reconcile with people who don't deserve it Lord only you can do that through us but thank you that we can choose by the power and the help of the Holy Spirit to have an agape love not just a human love not a friendship love but Lord something that is Supernatural that will give evidence that you're alive forgive us for loving less than we can and should fill us with the spirit and produce in us that kind of love that's Eternal for we ask it in Jesus name amen let's all stand and sing together nobody but Jesus nobody but you Francis Thompson wrote these few lines became famous for this poem this is not the whole poem but it's the beginning of speaking of God he said I fled him down the nights and down the days I fled him down the arches of the years I fled him down the Labyrinth of ways of my own mind and in the midst in the midst of tears I hid from him under running laughter of vested hopes I sped and I

beat and a voice Beat more instant than defeat All Things betray thee who betrayed me Francis Thompson's early life was just one dead end after another he studied for the priesthood he did not complete the course he studied medicine but he failed he joined the military he was released after one day", "he finally became a heroin addict in London and he lived with the homeless the Thames River he contemplated suicide but he was saved after he was given a vision and then he realized he could not get away from God's persistent love for you know what you can run the rest of your life but you do it to your own destruction stop running from God's love and if you feel convicted that you haven't been loving stop feeling like you should have been come back to the source Jesus tells the church at Ephesus remember from where you have fallen repent do the Deeds you did at first you got great theology but you've left your first love and if you have never come to Christ don't try to forgive people in your own strength you can't God will give you a love that'll give you an ability that you will never have it's not going to glorify you it's going to Magnify Him our prayer room is open if you need prayer taking the initiative to love somebody who has hurt you is never going to come naturally to you you say but you don't know what they did to me listen you probably aren't completely innocent oh yes I am okay then good because Jesus was completely innocent and he took the initiative to reconcile so if you really are you've done nothing wrong and somebody's angry and has hurt you you have your chance to reflect the love of God you need the love of God to be poured out in your heart but he's in the business of doing it and doing it and doing it again but you have to ask if you're new I want to meet you I'll be out in the courtyard if you have a minute if you have not met me please take a moment the rest of you love the people around you meet them tell them you're glad they're here have a", "study of a book is no different lord we want all that you have for us we need your help to discover jesus in this in these pages i know he's here i know you wrote it about yourself lord but we want help to receive all that you have for us tonight so we commit not just tonight but our on wednesday nights and i thank you for every person who's here going through what they're going through would you meet their needs as we study in jesus name amen you can stay standing then the lord called to moses and he spoke to him from the tent of meetings speak to the sons of israel and say to them when any man of you brings an or the flock from the herd he shall offer it a male without a defect he shall offer it at the doorway of the tent of meeting remember that's what we've been studying the tabernacle that he may be accepted before the lord he shall lay his hand on may be accepted for him that wasn't burnt yet okay this is it's going to be accepted for him to make atonement on his behalf he shall slay the young bull before the lord and aaron's sons the priest shall offer up the blood sprinkle the blood around on the altar that is at the doorway of the tent of meaning he shall then skin the burnt the sons of aaron the priest shall put fire on the altar arrange wood on the fire then aaron's sons and the priest shall arrange the pieces the head the over the wood which is on the fire that is on the altar its entrails however and its legs he shall wash with water the priest shall offer up in smoke all of it on the altar for a burnt soothing aroma to the lord well let's have you sit now and we'll read more as we get to it before we even start into chapter 1 as far as studying it i kind of want to just say a few words about the book of leviticus i don't know that it's the least read and studied book in the bible but it's got to be up there in the top people don't get very far into the book of leviticus before they many times go elsewhere and so i want you to our study not only tonight but over the next few weeks with a mindset we needed it in exodus we're going to need it in to understand why this book is here why it's important and what practical things", "we should be taking out of it let me start with a couple of quotes by names of people you have heard the first is by jonathan edwards what's jonathan edwards associated with what century did he live in okay this isn't a history class so 18th century and the great awakening in the united states he preached sinners in the hands of an angry god new england began there at northampton jonathan incredible theologian said he that sees the beauty of holiness or true moral good it's another way of sees the greatest and most important thing in the world that was his opinion and then charles a 19th century prince of the preachers he's called said this if i had my choice of all the blessings i can conceive of i would choose perfect conformity to the lord jesus or in one word interesting warren weirsby who's written a whole uh series of commentaries on the bible and i highly recommend them to if you want to get a single commentary on a book of the bible by the way his his commentary on leviticus is called be holy every one of his commentaries is it's the b series and it two words usually and be holy here's what he said whatever the professing church may be known for today then he mentions some things great crowds large expensive buildings big budgets political clout one thing it's not distinguished for is happiness not holiness is the chief pursuit of most people today including most professing christians they want jesus to solve their problems and carry their burdens but they don't want him to control their lives and change their character it's an interesting statement you may know this you may not it's one of those things that isn't one of those happy kind of things to share about but do you know that is actually as high or higher in the evangelical community than it is did you know that um in fact there's a divorce in america every 36 seconds 100 per hour 24 hours a day baylor university uh is the one who did a recent study on this and they living among evangelical christians or if that's the community you live around you have a much higher chance of getting a divorce than if you don't now that's not good news guys that's just one example of how the church is not necessarily reflecting the lord in a culture that needs to see the lord but reflects of the culture to one leviticus teaches us how to avoid sin where's be says and how to grow hebrews 12 14", "you might know this verse says pursue with all men and pursue holiness without which no man shall see the lord and then he said this god wants his children to be happy the true happiness however begins with holiness jesus said blessed are happy are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness for they shall be satisfied leviticus tells us how to do two things appreciate holiness listen and appropriate holiness into our everyday life there's no question as to what this book is all about it uses words connected with cleansing 71 times and has reference to uncleanness 128 times so the key verses in this book leviticus 11 you might want to jot down leviticus 11 44 and 45. here's what god says later in the book i am the lord consecrate yourselves therefore and be be holy for i am holy and you shall not make yourselves unclean with any of the swarming things that swarm on the earth talking about the dietary laws for i am the lord who brought you out of to be your god thus you shall be holy for i am holy that is the key verse that's what this book is all about and then by the phrase be holy for i am holy you need to know that's used eight times in the bible and peter picks it up in the new testament and applies it to you into me if you're a christian first peter chapter 1 verses 15 and 16. he says this but like the holy one that's christ who called you be holy yourselves also in all your behavior because it is written then he quotes leviticus you shall be for i am holy so i i want you to understand kind of what this book is about i think we make the mistake of thinking that this is just ritual this is just about the priests of the old testament and how to to prepare sacrifices and we're not under the law and we're not in the temple we're not into the sacrificial system so it's kind of irrelevant we're just studying somebody else's religion this is judaism 101 oh man if you have that mindset you're going to miss truths that apply to your life right now that are put this first principle down on your outline if you're taking notes i hope you are the basis of coming near to god isn't singing i know he just sang and i loved it but it's not singing it's you will hear me say and if you haven't you need to remember this the when people think about what is the", "the worship book of the old testament they think psalms psalms is not the worship book of the old testament it is the song book of the old testament there's 150 songs psalms mostly written by david and a few others asaph and one by moses but the worship book of the old testament is leviticus why because it's going to declare to us that god is holy and to approach him you must approach him in holiness that the goal of worship is to be holy we study this on sunday tie the messages together if you were here we think this time right before i study and teach is our worship time and we call it worship i we're not going to change our culture okay i'm not going to pretend i can't but we studied in the book of james this is pure non-defiled religion there is a pure religion which is the outward expression of true faith in god what we call worship this is pure non-defiled worship and it had to do with the way you live right it had to do with controlling your mouth bridling your mouth if you can't bridle your mouth your worship your religion is vain it's worthless he said if you don't have compassion for other people caring about ministering to widows and orphans in their distress if you aren't keeping yourself unstained by the world so that you might witness to a lost world he's talking about worship in practical ways that we live not in a half an hour segment that you so i'm not putting down singing because i believe we worship the lord in all kinds of ways one of them is exalting christ and it's special don't get me wrong i would never get rid of it but it's dangerous thinking if you limit your mind that worship is the singing part of a church service it's not it's so much more than that so the basis according to scripture of coming close to into a relationship with god it's not he he he inhabits the praises of his people but it's not they don't you don't sing and then find the presence of god in the old testament it's got to be a and that's all about who jesus is so first sacrifice we're going to study tonight in our in our chapter is the sacrifice of the christ is our burnt going to discover that as we go through the book of leviticus so if you thought we looked for jesus in the tabernacle and in the priesthood we did but we're the whole bible is about him and", "everything that god instituted for his people we're all fulfilled in christ and therefore we can go and look at what god commanded the people to whether it's the the seven feasts that god commanded them obey or the six sacrifices that he's commanding them to participate in every one of those will reveal some aspect of who jesus is so keep your your jesus eyes on for our whole study now in our text tonight in chapter one we just studied part of it so far red part of it there are our three kinds of burnt offerings there's a burnt from the herd that speak of oxen being from the sheep and the goats in verses 10 through 13 and then at the end of the chapter in verses 14 through 17 there is a pigeon or a turtle dove and we'll see that while each of these are different in some ways they all have a singular message so let's first of all thinking couldn't have any other offerings until and by the way last week we studied the completion of the tabernacle everything's built it's all ready to go it's kind of like we're going to open for operation and now we're going to study about the sacrifices that will be offered so put this down he that's christ comes from among the flock as a male without defect look at the text again leviticus chapter one beginning at the beginning then the lord called moses from the ten of meetings saying speak to the sons of israel and say to them when here's what you're to bring you're to so it's got to come from their herd and it has to be a male without defect you don't have to be brilliant to see any parallels here i don't think but jot a couple passages down deuteronomy 18 15 is a prophecy that moses gave concerning a future prophet that god would have arise to speak his word to his people moses is saying i'm going to die but god's going to bring a prophet this is a very important prophecy because the jews were waiting for messiah to come they were waiting for elijah to come and they were waiting for the prophet a lot of christians know about how elijah is coming because the end of the book of the old testament of malachi ends with these words the lord will send elijah the prophet before the great and glorious day of the lord shall come and he'll turn the hearts of the children of the fathers in the hearts of the fathers to the children lest i come and smite the land", "with a curse the last word of malachi is a prophecy that elijah is coming remember the disciples were struggling because jesus had said basically john the baptist was elijah and then they said well i thought elijah was coming you know before the second coming yeah there's one coming it was confusing to them but we know elijah is supposed to be coming he's predicted we also know that messiah is coming and they're waiting for messiah to come so the reason i mention all this when john the baptist is baptizing the jews came out and said to him who are you no my name's john you know are you the messiah nope are you the prophet who was to come now what are they talking about see they see these as three different people the fact is the prophet who was to come is prophesied in deuteronomy 18 15 and jesus is the prophet who has come they just didn't know that here's what it says the lord your god will raise up for you a prophet like me actually moses you're like him from what from your countrymen and you shall jew it has to be somebody coming from among his people to qualify that's where that one has to come from the very flock and then interesting it says he's to be defect a male without defect and of course we know this is exactly who jesus remember jesus would say which of you convicts me of sin or which of you can accuse me of sin i dare you to say that to people that love you i never say to my own family you know at thanksgiving while we're all here i'm just wondering none of you knows of anything i've ever done wrong do you they would love me to do that i i that would be fun they'd be going can i go first no i want to go i have several right now just since you mean just since we got here no only jesus can ask that question which of you convicts me of sin like i said in john 8 when the woman caught in adultery is there and they say moses said to stoner and he says let him who is without sin cast the first stone he's the only one who qualified and he's not by the way that's true jesus clears the room of the accusing voices that's always the way he is but he's not here to throw stones at you i didn't come to condemn but to save and so it's interesting jesus declared it about himself that he was sinless", "we think of even his enemies think of remember pilate washes his hands i won't condemn him i do not find any guilt in him behold the man i i can't condemn him i'll let you guys condemn him but i won't because i've interrogated him i do not find any sin there it's very interesting jot down luke 23 and verse 4. luke 23 and verse 4 pilate said to the chief priests and the multitudes i find no guilt in the men and then of course we know judas who betrays jesus later returned the money he felt horrible that he had taken 30 pieces of silver to betray jesus and he says i have betrayed innocent blood the betrayer of jesus admitted he we didn't do anything wrong and of course the centurion when he saw the way that jesus died and breathed his last in luke 23 47 he said this was the son of god so there's a movie where it's played by john wayne the voice of john wayne truly this one was the son of god kid um it's the greatest story ever told if you haven't seen it you've got to watch it anyway so even christ's enemies acknowledge the fact that he was righteous man so he qualifies he is among from god's people he is a male and he's without defect put this down his sacrifice is the one way the only way to at the doorway of the tent of meeting god's presence is in the holy of holies if you're going to come into god's presence you're going to get close to god it's going to start here at the doorway we have studied this in exodus jesus said i door if you're gonna get salvation there is only one way he said in john 14 no one comes to the father but by me so if you're not sure you know did jesus ever really say he was the only way to god yes he said it himself it is declared clearly in scripture you say well where is that john 14 6 and acts 4 12 and 13. if you're wanting to share with somebody that the bible some people don't know their bible saying well jesus never claimed to be the only way to god yes he actually did and so that was the what was taught by the by the early church in acts 4 12 there is salvation in no one else it's pretty clear there is salvation to no one else for there is no other name given among men by which we must be saved that's the only way to god", "the world says there are many ways to always ultimately lead to god but the bible says no there's only one and christ's sacrifice is the one way to meet god it's at the entrance to the tent of meeting then put this down see yourself as a sinner and jesus christ as a sinless substitute if you're going to be made right with god this is the theology you have to first of all admit and confess you're a sinner and see jesus christ as your substitute look at verse four in the beginning of verse five here's the person who brings this to god shall lay his hand on the head to kill and to offer for you you bring it but then you lay your hand on the be accepted for you to make atonement or covering for your sins on your behalf and he shall slay the young the lord very interesting to me now the concept that is taught through this passage and many others concerning we'll study in the future is is this the consecration and forgiveness through listen to me identification consecration in other words this animal is taking my place but what's going on here is a very graphic picture that if you put yourself in the position of somebody trying to get right with god you had to actually lay your hand on this innocent animal and you have to see it be slain or slay god is going to accept the sacrifice of in it's like this that animal becomes condemned in your behalf it's what we call substitutionary atonement someone who's taking the place for you but you had to kill the innocent you might say it was a very hands-on not somebody else gonna do this for you you know in the back room and handle that for you thank you very much no you're going to have to be involved and here's the deal the laying on of the hands is called shemakah in hebrew it means to lean in confessing yourself a sinner and saying i am transferring my guilt by the grace of god to this innocent animal who does not deserve to do be hurt at all and it's going to take my place because what's about to happen to it is exactly what i deserve according to the law of god i should be slaughtered now so you are a part of that experience accepting the fact that it should i love that fact that in the passion of the christ mel gibson's movie there's only one scene where you see any of mel gibson i've shared it before anybody", "remember what the scene is what air is it al it's when the hammer is coming down on actually you don't see mel's face but he's the one he said i'm gonna i'm gonna be the one nailing the nail into jesus's hands because my sin put jesus on the cross that's what he said i've got to be the one because i and i think too often we are so distant from the reality that we we don't you want me to accept it was my sin that puts you on the cross vivid illustration if you can think of taking an animal and doing this you know some of you well i don't have an oxen or i'm not suggesting thinking about your dog or your cat but the fact is you have some animal that you have and it's innocent this is pretty heavy stuff if you think about it and it's supposed because it's a heavy thing we'll put this animal then was consumed completely consumed completely and given god remember it's a type of christ look at the second part of verse five through sons the priests shall offer up the blood and sprinkle the blood around on the altar that is at the doorway of the tent of meaning he shall then skin the of aaron the priest shall put fire on the altar and arrange the wood on the fire so it's kind of like a barbecue but you're not going to be this be eating it it's going to be completely consumed then aaron's sons the priest shall arrange the pieces they had the suit over the wood which is on the fire that is on the altar its entrails internal organs however and its legs he shall wash with water and the pre shall offer up in smoke and here's the phrase you want to underline your bible all of it all of it on the altar for a burnt aroma to the lord now there are various sacrifices that we'll be studying in the the offerings that is completely consumed by fire nothing left at all it's all given to god by this you know the bible says our god is a consuming dedicated there's nothing left at all given to god and of course it ascends to the lord in smoke this is a picture of jesus christ first of all in his surrendered life that he he was completely dedicated to god's will i always do the things that are pleasing to him both his life on the cross but especially as he dies at calvary he's completely surrendered to god shot down isaiah 53 and verse 12.", "there in that chapter that predicts the suffering servant who is christ coming and like the lamb led to the slaughter it's clearly a prophecy of jesus it says therefore after he gives his life i god speaking i will allot him a portion with the great and he will divide the booty with the strong because he poured out himself to death and was numbered with the transgressors yet he himself bore the sin of many and interceded for the christ is the one who because he gave his life completely he satisfied god's you know you might put it this way this is what christ did for us and it becomes life that he's asking us to imitate uh in as a believer he wants us to die to ourselves and live for him you might put it this way the national flag of a spirit-filled christian is always going to be the white flag the flag that says i fully laying down his will to god jesus said in the garden nevertheless not my will be done but yours so it speaks of the different parts of the animal the head of course speaks of the mind christ was completely surrendered to god the suet actually speaks of the fat the fat in the bible speaks of the excesses and of course christ didn't have any excesses the entrails verse 9 and verse 13 speaks of the inward parts uh every part of christ was pleasing and presented to god the legs were washed um christ lived out a sinless life he was pure in fact it's interesting when you think about the legs that speaks of christ's walk john the baptist it says saw jesus it's an interesting phrase as he walked and he said to the others behold the lamb of god it takes away the sin of the world it's as the lord is walking christ lived the lifestyle that was qualifying to fulfill the law he only one who does put this down see what being on fire requires what being on fire requires in verses 10 flock of the sheep or the goats for a without defect he shall slay it on the side of the altar northward before the lord and aaron's sons the priest shall sprinkle its blood around on the altar he shall then cut it into its pieces with its head in its suet the priest shall arrange them on the wood which is on the fire that is on the altar the entrails however and the legs he shall wash similarly to the other with water and the priest shall offer all of it", "and offer it up in smoke on the altar it of a soothing aroma to the lord so it could have been an oxen it could have been a sheep or a goat we'll talk about the difference between these toward the end of the chapter but some things to notice here put this down a sacrifice was placed on upon god's altar it's not hard to see that jesus christ would die on a cross us in this jot down luke 12 and verses 49 through 50. listen to what jesus said concerning his death on the cross luke 12 49 he said i have come to cast fire on the earth and how i wish it were he said but i have a baptism to undergo and how distressed i am until it is accomplished now let me ask you a question you're bible students you come on wednesday nights jesus had already by john at the jordan he said i have a baptism to undergo what's he talking about what was the baptism jesus still needed to undergo anybody have a clue shh right there yeah the baptism remember even the water baptism that john about when he baptized jesus is a picture not of jesus being washed of his it's a picture of jesus accepting your sin and my sin he is being baptized into this is the beginning of his ministry folks he is saying i accept what that baptism represents which is my death so he had a water baptism but he's looking forward to the baptism of the death the baptism of god's fire if you will on the he came to die i have a baptism to undergo i'm here this is why i'm here and this is what he is referring to remember john the baptist said i baptize in water he will baptize you with the holy spirit and fire now some believe that was just talking about pentecost others believe it's about judgment very interesting he said but first i have my own baptism to undergo and i believe that's talking about the fire of god's judgment on the cross listen let me let me give us a kind of a principle very clear to me about what jesus teaches us through his sacrifice as we look at our own for him because this all of it completely anything less than that will not work so incomplete surrender you might want to jot this down incomplete surrender in your life or anyone's life limits the power of the holy spirit if you retain control of your life if you give the lord part of your life", "the lord is happy to work with what you give him but you will never know the fullness of what god wants to do with your life christ's example is 100 given away i think i shared this a long time ago many many years ago i had a fireplace in our first house it was a small little house in placentia that actually burned i think they only have those now in like because at home now i have a little switch you push a switch and it's like puts out virtually no heat it's almost as good as just having one on your tv a little better anyway this was an actual fireplace it was built this house in 1959 and had all the cracks in the walls to prove it and uh other problems but but you know uh we in the cold you know we didn't get southern california but once in a while like late it gets cold and so you know we we were looking to save money and and firewood was ex was expensive and so we didn't have firewood and but we wanted to have a fire i remember at christmas time we we couldn't wait till christmas was over because we take the christmas tree and man that's fun you know of course it's all over in 30 seconds it burns so quick but we didn't have any firewood so one day i heard some some motors some kind of a chainsaw going on out front and i went out and i saw the city crew was cutting all of arches we had trees up you know along the parkway they were going up and down the street cutting the trees you know trimming them because i guess that was the city's trees or something and i saw they were putting these perfect sized logs in a big pile on the yards it wasn't their job to collect them some other person was coming in a truck to pick them up and so i thought that's like free firewood so i i walked over with my son's wagon just in case and i said hey um you guys are going to do anything with that they go we don't know whatever i said can i have it they go sure i'm just taking like this free firewood back to the house trip after trip i had firewood for like the next 10 years just yeah because it doesn't get cold out of but i was ready to go i could not wait i could not wait till we could have a fire", "it was a cold day and so i went and i got some of it and i built this beautiful boy scout worthy fire uh for my wife and my three sons and i could not get it to light i could i did i tried newspaper i okay i put gasoline all over it do not do this my family survived but it was not the right thing i was just getting mad at the wood it would not burn and i it was it would sizzle and i felt so embarrassed you know and i remember going to work and i was telling one of the other police officers where i work yeah this stupid woods and he said well did you let dry it out i said try it out it's wood well the problem is it's green i don't know no it's gray it's not why it's not green he goes no no no you don't understand what green wood means anyway he did you know he finally explained to me it was it still has way too much water in it you just cut it down you got to cut it in half let it dry out it will never or not for years it's going to take i didn't know you had to prepare the and here's the problem wood that just comes off a tree listen to me it won't catch fire because it still has its own life in it you will not catch see jesus said if you want to come after limited surrender you hold on to your life you cannot you will not catch you but you will never catch on fire it's not possible fascinating that this burnt had to be able to give up its life galatians 2 20 paul said i am crucified with christ it's no longer i who live but christ lives in me and the life which i now live i live by faith in the son of god who loved me and delivered himself up for me so here's my question that's why my title is without reservation have you ever in your entire christian life been able to consider yourself sold out to the lord oh i don't mean yeah when i have you ever come to a place where that would be the right description of your sold out for christ or do you feel like no that convicts me i just know that that's not who i've ever been so then let me ask you if you say you struggle with admitting that or being able to admit that's true of you what's holding you back from doing that", "so i don't really know well i want you to think about it what is your reservation that you have about total resignation that's keeping you back is it some sin in your life that you know you would have to give up for some people unwilling to give something up um it was who prayed lord make me pure but not yet that's what he prayed his mom was a christian and he was immoral and he he said lord i i want to repent of all my sins except this one that's what that was how he just never could get really right he never even came to christ yet he just he knew he should change but he wasn't willing to change or let the lord change everything and maybe the problem is in your life of what it would mean to fully surrender to the lord you don't pray like that you don't do that because you feel like it won't work for you then what do you do or you fear that it might and other people think you're a weirdo and that would be you know or people will have expectations about you why have you not sold out completely to the lord what are you waiting for i want you to jot down luke 9 verses 59-62 listen to what jesus said luke 9 jesus said to a man follow me he said permit me to go and bury my father jesus said allow the dead to bury their but as for you go and proclaim everywhere the kingdom of god and another also say i'll follow you lord but first permit me to say goodbye to those who are at home and jesus said to them no one after putting his hand to the plow and looking back is fit for the kingdom everyone who's called by the lord is release their entire life in order to follow him and you can't follow him unless you do it's not you can follow him sort of actually that doesn't work jot down matthew 19 verses 16-22 you're familiar with the story the old one came to him and said teacher what good thing shall i do that i may obtain eternal life and he said well why are you asking me about what's good there's only one who is good but if you wish to enter into life be saved keep he said which ones and jesus said then he quotes the second table of the law you shall not commit adultery shall not steal shall not bear false witness and honor your father and mother and you shall love your neighbor as", "yourself and the young man said to him all these things i have kept what am i still lacking jesus said to him well if you wish to be complete go and sell your possessions give them to the poor and you shall have treasure in heaven and come and follow me but when the young man heard this statement he went away greed for he was one who owned i don't think it's always possessions that keep people from following jesus but maybe that's your problem what would jesus put his finger on because that's what he did with that young man he put his finger on the one thing that he was not going to do and he walked away sorrowful because he wasn't willing to do the one thing he felt like everything else i'm good to go he probably wasn't but he thought he was one area i want you to jot down a verse that you sell to him sermon on luke 14 and verse 33 listen to what jesus said so therefore no one of you can be my disciple who does not give up all his possessions say oh i don't like that verse what does it say in the original pretty much that you said then how are any of us christians i still have stuff i have a car i have a house or i have clothes i have a job i have some money in my bank i guess i'm not his disciple well what jesus actually said was you cannot be his disciple if you claim if that's still yours then you're not his disciple or you don't understand what a disciple is it doesn't mean that you had to go sell it like you told the rich young ruler but you have to resign it that it's not yours oh you're a steward of it but he's the owner of it amen you have to accept that or you haven't even begun by the way the lamb or the goat was to be killed on the altar northward which is interesting because you see the cross of calvary was of the temple grounds just north of the city of jerusalem put this down this sacrifice reaches heaven since it pleases god it says that it ascends up to god as an acceptable sacrifice to the lord jot down ephesians 5 verses 1 and 2. ephesians 5 says therefore be imitators of god as beloved children walk in love just as christ also loved you gave sacrifice to god as a fragrant aroma then under letter c we see christ's utter humiliation on calvary in", "the last few verses i want you to look at verses 14 through 17 as we go down to the third grouping of burnt offerings which are the birds turtle doves or from young pigeons the priest shall bring it to the altar and ring off its head and offer it up in smoke on the altar and its blood is to be drained out on the side of the altar he shall also take away its crop with its feathers and cast it besides the altar eastward to the place of the ashes then he shall tear it by its wings but he shall not and the priest shall offer it up in smoke on the altar on the wood which is the lord very interesting so the bird that was brought if that's what you brought for your sacrifice for your had to ring off its head it's had a crown of thorns that was literally a ring piercing his skull now this phrase the crop and the feathers i want to take a moment on that because actually the hebrew probably the feathers although some translations say that's possible the um anybody know what the crop is on a yeah i thought it was the the the head too it's not the crop is actually a pouch in the bird's throat you know how birds can like save stuff in the throat to give to their baby birds okay that's the crop the crop is at the top of the stomach the it it hooks up to the stomach it's the entrance to the stomach and so the word feathers probably in the hebrew is actually a different word it speaks of that portion of the innards of the animal that is to be cleaned out in order for it to be sacrificed the reason that that's very interesting is this is the digestive tract think about it this way think about what you do when you catch a fish that you're about to eat okay you clean the fish you cut it down and you get the stuff out right that's the idea here which is the idea of this sacrifice is being prepared as on the altar of god now what do you mean by that bob well the picture of christ's sacrifice is to satisfy his righteous demands okay jot down romans 3 verses 25 and 26 romans 3 whom god of christ put forward as a propitiation a satisfier of wrath by his blood to be received by faith this was to show god's righteousness because in his divine forbearance he had passed over former sins it was to show", "his righteousness at the present time so that he might be just and the justifier of him who has faith in jesus we read about this in scripture that christ is our propitiation he is the one who god and god accepts it on our behalf that's the idea is that when christ was offered to god it was acceptable food to god is the idea then we see the wings or the arms of this bird are are our are outstretched of course we see christ on the cross with his arms outstretched and he talks about how he would have gathered us under the pinions uh his saving of jerusalem and then it's interesting because the bird was uh torn if you will but not broken by the way the bible's really clear that no bone of christ could be broken on the cross why is that significant whose bones were broken on the cross remember it was passover and they were trying to hasten the death of these criminals normally when you were crucified well not that you were normally crucified but when somebody was normally crucified it was torture and they wanted it to last just as long as they wanted just to be in pain and humiliation so there was no like this is not a firing squad crucifixion is torture and humiliation in this particular case because passover was coming they wanted to hasten their debts and the only way to hasten their debts was to keep them from being able to push up on the bottom rung with their feet to get a breath because otherwise they'd suffocate you suffocate on on the cross when you run out of strength okay that's what happened so they would come with a large metal mallet and they would break the legs of the criminals that were being crucified so they could no longer lift up and they would suffocate rather quickly that's why it was remarkable that jesus was already dead it didn't make any sense to pilate when when they said you know somebody wants his body is he checked as he was dead he was dead they remember the centurion checked and the water and blood proved that he was dead but the thieves had to have their legs broken now the reason this is important to understand that they didn't break jesus's legs why even point that out because the prophecy and the type of the lamb that must be sacrificed is no bone would be broken in its body back in christ is the lamb whose life is given but no bone can be broken", "frankly when we say the body of christ broken for you actually that's not accurate christ's body was never broken the bread is broken but christ's body was never broken so it's the body of christ given for you technically not that you want you to worry about that the rest of your life but that's true christ fulfilled the prophecy of the passover lamb and no bone was broken in the same way this will be torn if you will but it's not going to be broken and then it was cast out the this the east side of the altar after the ashes of it why the east side well the east side think about it that we studied the tabernacle is the farthest away from the holy of holies and it's it's put into the ashes remember what jesus said on the cross my god my god yeah so we see here the picture of distant from the very presence of god now here's the thing about these three different kinds of offerings they're different we have oxen we have sheep and goats and we have birds doves and pigeons um by the way let me just say one thing about pigeons because it's kind of funny when we started a church in cuba the first the young man who had become a christian when we first went there became the pastor richard he's still the pastor in fact he'll be coming to visit here next month uh calvary chapel in there in havana and he saw our church and we were calvary chapel and he wanted to start a calvary chapel so he did and he loved pastor chuck and he got to meet chuck when he was still alive but he saw the maranatha dub we used to have a maranatha dove on our wall always had a mirror not the dub and he goes i want one of those for my church that i'm starting he started a church in his home and so we you know we we wanted to get him one and somehow get it over there and without a breaking and all that and we eventually did but i'll never forget when he wrote me asking he didn't ask for a dub he asked if we could bring him a holy pigeon and we laughed and laughed i said you know it's actually a dove and you know what i found out in the yeah it it dove could be pigeon it actually could have been a pigeon uh there in in the jordan so he was actually more right not laughing at him like you just don't know", "yeah you don't know anything anyway um but a dove or a pigeon could be used as to say while they are different if you really read through these three they are singular in the message that they are uh teaching but some different aspects so i want you just to grab the differences real quick the oxen helps us to see if you will the strong one put in the word strong the strong one who bears our burden and pulls us out of sin that's who christ is the oxen that's offered is a type of christ he's the strong one who bears our burden and pulls us out of sin the lamb is of course the perfect one who comes to take away our sin okay he's the perfect one who comes to take away our sin behold the lamb of god it takes away sin the goat now if you think about this remember when jesus comes back in matthew 25 he separates as a shepherd separates the what the sheep and the well wait a minute the sheep are saved the goats no goat they're getting in ah the goat represents the rejected one who for us became sin by the way on yom kippur the holiest day of the year you know what's offered for the sins of not a lamb it's a goat fact it's two goats there's the scapegoat which by the way that phrase comes right from the bible where the sins are confessed over it and it's put out into the wilderness and there's the goat that's actually the blood is put in the holy of holies and so the goat represents the rejected one who for us became sin and then the bird and this is interesting this is the gentle one remember jesus said be the gentle one who comes for the poorest sinner mary and joseph could not afford anything but turtle doves when they because in the scriptures in the old testament it's the turtle doves that the poor people could only afford they couldn't afford a lamb they couldn't afford a goat they couldn't afford an but they could afford these less expensive birds but it represents christ who said i am gentle and of humble heart who came if you will from heaven it's amazing but it's four so it doesn't matter what resources you is adequate for your needs i don't care what what capacities you have as far as wealth you need christ to be sacrificed for you and he's available for you and then put this down we need to answer uh the lord's call to total surrender", "and we use this verse a lot but i think it's important i'd encourage you to memorize it jot it down romans 12 1-2 i think i quoted it sunday paul says i urge you therefore brethren by the mercy of god present your bodies now now it's not just recognized jesus died for you now in response to what he's done for you now it's your turn present your bodies a living and holy what which is acceptable to god it's your spiritual service of worship worship is not singing it's and don't be conformed to the world but be transformed by the renewing of your mind you know um i i don't know if this product is even still i don't do a lot of shopping uh does borden still so borden uh became wealthy the the borden family basically on products concerning milk and condensed milk in the 19th century by the time of the turn of the century the borden empire was huge and the amount of money that they'd amassed was and they had the borden family had a son named william and william borden was born in 1904 he was the heir to the borden uh fortune at 16 years of age he was a smart kid um and he did really well in school and his dad to reward him for he graduated 16 sent him on a cruise because they were wealthy of the whole world so he left for this world cruise and while he was on these ships he met some missionaries who were actually going to asia to minister and he was powerfully impacted by their lives now uh mrs borden his mom had come to the lord and uh so it was kind of a christian family he had grown up you know knowing the truths of christianity but he had never met the lord while he was away on this trip he uh was in europe in england and he got to hear the preaching of r.a torrey now if you don't know who ari tori is he was instrumental by the way in the founding of biola and and some of you have how many of you have heard of retori worth reading whenever you can great preacher but anyway he hears the preaching of ra tori in england and he gets saved he gets radically saved in fact at that service they all stood and at the end of it they sang the hymn which was written in 1896 i surrender all some of you know that him it's been around for a while i surrender all to jesus", "after this he wrote home and he told his that he wants to become a missionary a friend of his in response to that letter said you'll be throwing your life away if you do that in terms of what god might want to do with your life it was at that time that he wrote he had a bible he wrote two words in the fly leaf of his bible he came back home he's just a young man at this point he goes to yale which while it was a christian school was already struggling with liberalism and as a freshman he started a prayer meeting uh which then became a bible study that he helped lead and 150 started attending it and then by the time he was a senior just four years later listen to this a out of the total 1300 student body of yale were all attending bible studies all as a result of the bible studies that he started but he didn't just have bible studies on this quasi-christian campus they were always trying to witness to the kids that were clearly not believers there and if there was something really hard to get to they always he always took them but he would also go into town he would pick up drunks off the street and feed them he would minister to the widows and the orphans and the people that were disabled he actually started a mission called yale hope mission while he was still there at yale when he was graduated from school he was offered several high-paying jobs he turned them all down and he wrote two more words on the fly leaf of his bible he had already written remember no reserves now he wrote no retreats he had no intention of taking a secular he wanted to go be a missionary he goes to princeton seminary he graduates and he sails for china why because he wants to minister to a particular muslim group in china that's where he feels called by this time and he's going to go and give his life as a missionary and on the way to china in egypt so he can learn arabic he wants to learn arabic if he's going to minister to muslims he's going to have to know arabic he gets spinal meningitis and he dies a month later at the age of 25. it was world news it was all over in somebody writing his biography said was william borden's life wasted and they said not from god's perspective in fact shortly before his death he two final words to his bible", "he had already written remember earlier in his life no regret or no reserves and no retreats now he read no regrets i think we have a picture of him right there this is his testimony he didn't he he had no regrets about how he had decided to live his life i love this spirit of this young man who inspired many people by the way to give their lives to serving the lord and to come to the lord because he decided i don't care how long i live i want my life to count for christ and however long that's going to be it's very very much like jim elliott who said he is no fool who gives up what he cannot keep to gain that which can't be taken from him so my question for you and the time we have and we have just a is to ask you again have you ever fully surrendered your life to christ and said i want you to have it all and then live that out you say well bob i can't say i've lived it out i haven't been perfect i'm not asking if you've i'm asking you if you aside your claim to your own life and have said from now on if i'm holding anything back tonight today whatever it is from now on god i want it to be yours i want to turn over every sin not only that i've committed that i feel guilty about but every sin that i struggle with i want to have victory over it with your help i want my money my my entertainment my passions my will to be yours i want to live the galatians 2 20 in life not just respect paul for doing it and other people who have done it or william borden's i want to be william borden i want to be a person who lives for you however long i'm going to live that's why i'm on this planet have you ever done that and if not what are you waiting for i was a christian and starting in 1971 and i'm so thankful somebody shared with me how to receive christ i hope you tell people about how to do that just tell people what people did to and when i could i would share with a few people i was a little embarrassed as a young christian about sharing my faith i tried to make my witness my clothing i would wear a shirt said jesus saves or a belt i remember how i built and said maranatha this is the 70s people come and go marijuana", "what happened who the what they didn't know what that word meant i wasn't ready really to explain the gospel i just thought maybe they'd get saved if they you know i had a bump striker in my car said give jesus a of course the way i drove people were going give him a chance to do what to pass you would owe you so fast i mean you know i wasn't really living a great witness but i didn't have much to witness from and i was ashamed of that i loved god and i believed the bible i didn't read the bible took it to church religion maybe you bring your bible to church but it's going to go right into your car or right back on the shelf and you won't be picked up until sunday or next wednesday i'm not putting you down i'm just saying i know how it is and i remember coming to a place and frankly for me it meant being around some other christians who were well totally surrendered to the lord on fire for the lord and i guess i didn't notice it when i was around my carnal christian friends because i just fit in but when i was around people that were really sold out it really stuck out it was like that's what i want to be but that's not who i am and i felt so embarrassed they didn't know me thankfully but i was attending this little bible study on friday nights for campus i was in college by this time and i was frustrated as a christian i thought will i ever will i ever be sold out for the lord well i always just be struggling with this the rest of my life worrying about what people think about me what non-christians think about me what my friends think about me wanting to enjoy this world and i love jesus but and you know what happened i go to this bible study i'd been a few times i liked it because these guys were on fire and the man who owned the home small group maybe 20 said to these young college kids you know he was probably in his 40s maybe 50 years old old man compared to us and he said i'm just wondering if there's anybody a christian but you've never really completely surrendered your life to the and you would like to do that tonight you know what he didn't have anybody he didn't make us raise our hand maybe if he had said that i wouldn't have done it so he never knew if anybody did it", "but he said if that's you i just want you to repeat a simple prayer with me tonight now i had prayed a sinner's prayer when i got saved this was not a sinner's prayer this was a surrendering prayer i'll be honest i knew i needed to pray it because i knew i needed to do it but i also didn't feel like praying that prayer was going to change but i didn't think praying the sinner's prayer would change me either boy did i get that wrong and so that night in 1975 january i prayed this simple prayer and all i can tell you is god was waiting for me to say it i felt like i was saying god i am so tired of trying to live the christian i feel like giving up and i felt like god whispered i've been waiting for you to do that because i want to work in your life but you've got to get out of the way i didn't even understand what that how that could happen but that night was when the spirit of god came on my life and i started having a hunger for god's word like i did not have before i couldn't have made it up i didn't go to some classes on how to be on fire there are no classes it's the power and the person of the holy spirit that you have to release yourself to and say i'm dead i want to die to me when you do that still waiting for you your life will change my life started to change that i would not be in the ministry today but even if i weren't in vocational ministry my life started to change then i could have lived the rest of my life as a get married to a functional christian have functional christian children go to a functional church where i do my functional christian thing and be satisfied but never really so my question is are you willing to do something with this message if you're me in 1975 are you willing to do it in 2021 tonight because if you need to you know it so i want to simply close us in prayer or worship him will come i want you to close your eyes i want you to bow your if you need the power of god to start a new work in your life if you need to be on fire and you can't make yourself on fire it's not an emotional it starts with a volitional choice of saying jesus what you did by being my the fire of god", "by being baptized with fire and god's i now want to be baptized with the holy spirit so that i might live like you if that's your desire would you just silently but to god these words i am tired i'm tired of wrestling with my shame and my guilt and my failings and my flaws i don't want to do it anymore i'm going to raise the white flag right i'm going to surrender that help my unbelief help me die lord i don't even know how to do it and start a brand new work in me i invite you to have all that i am from this day on with your help i surrender all that jesus christ might live in and for the glory of god and it's in his name i pray amen let's all stand there is no greater call than giving you there is no greater love you can have it all every part of my world coming up free will offerings but you it all starts there and without that given not just in leviticus in life if you say well bob i prayed the prayer but i've got something going on in my life that is big it's heavy i don't even know how to stop doing or i i don't i mean i'm stuck when lazarus was raised from the dead by he turned to the people around him and he said unbind him let him go free jesus does the supernatural work of giving new life to the dead but then he calls us to minister to one another to take the grave clothes that we've been in off maybe you need to make a trip to the prayer room and say i don't even know where to start with this relationship with this practice with this habit but i need god's help and i need you to pray for me that god will unbind me and let me go listen he'll use his people it's not going to all happen in a single prayer but it starts there so praise the lord if you made that decision tonight i'd love to know you made it so i can be praying for you now may god bless you and keep you may he make his face to shine upon you and be gracious unto you may he lift up his countenance upon you and give you his in the name of the father and the son and the holy spirit god bless", "opposition to each other there's a progression in Romans 5 verse 1 having been justified by faith we have peace with God then four verses later in Romans 5 and verse 5 because you're a born-again Christian the Holy Spirit has been poured out in your heart love has been poured out in your heart by the Holy Spirit to see we come into a right relationship with God through faith but one of them the expressions of that experience as the Spirit of God comes to make love alive and we love because we've been first loved first to God but then we start having God's love for other people so faith focuses on our vertical relationship with God being right love primarily focuses on our horizontal relationship with others and we're to be ministering in both of those equally jot down Ephesians 4:15 where Paul states it more plainly but speaking the truth in love notice we're to grow up in all aspects into him who is the head even Christ I remember years ago I used to work out at Cal State Fullerton in their workout area and we'd go with a friend of mine my pastor's son and I would go work out there and there was this guy that was there that had the largest biceps I think I've ever seen in my life and he was always doing one exercise curls massive biceps you know now we go Mac eyes the biggest it's huge but he had bird legs now we never mentioned that to him because even though they were skinny I think he could probably chase us down there are some people have one area of their spiritual life developed but they're not mature in other areas of their life we're to grow up in all aspects and all aspects into him who is Christ there needs to be a in fact balance is an evidence of maturity we are to be loving but were not to be silent about things that are wrong in our culture jesus said the world hates me I said the people ate me the Jews world of his ministry because I testified that their deeds are evil you can't get more loving than Jesus and if you think by being quiet about unrighteousness you're being loving you're not for if people don't know they have a problem with God how are they ever gonna be saved Satan would love to convince you you're being loving by saying nothing that's not true well I'm not gonna confront this brother of the sister about their sin because I love them too much well wait a minute sheezus", "said if your brother or sister sins go and reprove them in private wow I just love him too much no you don't so we need to be careful we don't deceive ourselves about this we're to speak the truth now there are some people that love speaking the truth they don't care who it hurts have Bible will travel my gift is rebuking I don't remember that in the list but I some people think that it's their gift remember years ago people you know would always talk about romain pastor Chuck's assistant pastor you know he was a drill sergeant before and after he left the military he did he would reprove people left and right I mean he he's the one who hired and fired on staff a lot of people worked at Calvary if he would look out his window and see somebody kind of in a hurry or or it didn't have a smile on their face he'd open the door go if you're worrying you're not trusting thanks for making that preciate I remember years ago we have a guy who thought he was called to the same ministry as romaine and I reminded him there's only one romaine praise God there's only one romaine I were to speak the truth but it needs to be in love jot down first Timothy four verses one through three you'll see where Paul's mind is but the Spirit of God explicitly says that in the later times that's our times you guys some will fall away a pasta sighs from the faith paying attention to deceitful spirits and the doctrines of demons by means of the hypocrisy of liars seared in their own conscience as with the branding iron men who forbid marriage and advocate abstaining from foods which God has created to be gratefully shared him by those who believe and know the truth there are those today who want to ignore what the Bible clearly teaches on moral issues they want to create kind of a designer spirituality you know this is I'm a spiritual personal I don't get involved with church I don't really you know read the Bible I just have my own version of Christianity jot down second Timothy 4 verses 2 through 4 later in this book toward the last chapter Paul will say preach the word Timothy preach the word but the latest movie not the latest cultural fad not the latest self-help principles preach the word be ready to do so in season when it's popular and when it's not reprove you got to rebuke and encourage or exhort with great patience and instruction why", "for the time will come I believe it's here when they will not endure what healthy same word healthy doctrine but they'll want to have their ears tickled they will accumulate for themselves teachers in accordance to their own desires and they'll turn away their ears from the truth and they will turn aside to myths you remember what the Apostle rrrow imagine there's no heaven it's easy if you try no hell below us above us only sky imagine all the people living for today well I can imagine that yeah it's not hard to imagine that at all imagine there are no countries no borders it isn't hard to do nothing to kill or die for no religion too imagine all the people living life in peace you who that's the best never got that Berlin Leonard Ravenhill talked about the church he was an english revivalist to later move to nine states and texas bald with keith greens ministry there before he passed away but he said this he said the church is supposed to do what to stop corruption we're come to be salt and light that's what salt does it's a preservative the church is supposed to do what it's to stop corruption is the church doing that no the world is corrupting the church remember we're to be in but not of the world that's what jesus said in his high priestly prayer we're in but not of the way it's kind of like a boat a boat is designed to be in the water when it's in the water it's right where it's supposed to be but water coming into the boat is a tragedy in the making the church is to be in the world but the world is not to be in the church Ravenhill said in so many places he's seen what he sees our preacher rets preaching sermonettes creating christian nets and that tendency in our culture now to have these large churches where really I just come for something that I can take home and encourage myself or to get my kids into a you know another program for them like soccer or something else this is just so they're not hanging around with bad kids he wrote this he said extra-biblical practices rape this is Ravenhill extra-biblical practices predictable programs and man's wisdom cannot sustain in other words watered-down oversized uncommitted spectator church is much like a pasture filled with astroturf to a sheep it looks amazing but in reality there's not much to eat sad to say that's the day and age we live in you know there are people who do not want us", "as a church to be speaking out to the issues of our day can I be very clear with you we will never God help us lose sight of our mission jesus said as the father has sent me so send I you make disciples of all the nations our mission is not to transform the world by voting in the right people I've often said you've heard me say it our answer is not the right man in the white house is the one man on the white horse that's the answer for this world that's that's that will never change but if we think because we understand our calling to make disciples and to share the gospel is why we're here on this earth that we can neglect God's command to us to be salt and light we are absolutely wrong but there are those who don't want the church to speak to out to any issues socially well you know III don't think the church should be political well I think when people say that what they really mean is I don't think the church should be biblical because the Bible deals clearly with the great and social moral issues of the day the Bible speaks to the issues of race the Bible speaks to the issues of poverty and by the way immigration by the way and divorce and marriage and the sanctity of life and sexuality the Bible speaks about all of those things this may surprise you this is a brand new survey that just came out from Barna recently only 10 percent of American Christians those who call themselves Christians have a biblical worldview only 10 percent one in 10 of those who self-identify as Christians can answer these six questions correctly do you believe Jesus live sinlessly perfect life only 10% of christians say yes to that did you know that maybe I don't I hope well secondly God still gets involved in the world today through answering prayer only ten percent do you believe that there are moral absolutes of right and wrong only ten percent say yes do you believe the Bible is accurate in all of its principles for for living this life and everything that it teaches ten percent do you believe that Satan is a real person or just an imaginary being and then number six a person who is generally good or does enough good things for others will earn a place in heaven true or false only ten percent get those right here's some statistics that may shock you 47% of Christians in our country believe Jesus sinned while", "on earth forty seven percent if you believe that you are not a Christian well neither are you I'm not trying to be mean tell you what the Bible teaches about Jesus Jesus can't save you if Jesus needed to be saved Bible is very clear jesus never sinned 70% of born-again Christians born-again Christians who identify believe you can get to heaven some other way than Jesus Christ I have a problem with that I think Jesus has a problem with that in John 14 he said I have the way the truth the life and Peter said in acts 4:12 there is salvation in no one else so if you believe differently that's just not what the scripture teaches but 70 percent of those who say they're born again claiming you get to heaven some other way 68 percent of Christians say it's okay to live together outside of marriage I guess they've never read Hebrews 13 marriage is a gift of God and the marriage bed is on defiled but fornicators and adulterers God will judge 70 percent of those who claim to be Christians like this I have a hard time believing this but I believe the source 70 percent of Christians said adultery is a morally acceptable behavior here's what God said about his people in Jeremiah remember Jeremih that's right before the Babylonians come God is judging his people here's how bad they've gotten he said my people do not even know how to blush and I say Lord is that where we're does judgment begins out the household of God now I know what people say and maybe you're even one of them I pray you're not but you'll have people who say it to you if you try to live out the Word of God and you share what the Word of God teaches about the issues of our day someone's gonna say you are so narrow you know what if they do here's your answer thank you really narrow Oh here's why Jesus said narrow is the way do I tell you something that people often forget truth by definition is narrow you know you say two plus two is four well what if I said I don't like that I want it to be 3.5 for a while you are so intolerant you say e equals mc-squared that's just your opinion what if I want e to equal M C to the third power hey you can say e equals MC Hammer if you want listen make it right or you open mind it just makes you greatly mistaken truth by definition is very", "narrow if there's one way to heaven I didn't decide that but I believe it Jesus said it's true you're gonna have to decide what you do with Jesus but this down know how to guard God's treasure within you but in the word guard and treasure verse 14 guard through the Holy Spirit who dwells in us the treasure which has been entrusted to you we jot down first Timothy 6:20 for most of you it's on your page just above the beginning of this book Oh Timothy guard what has been entrusted to you avoiding worldly and empty chatter and the opposing arguments of what is falsely called science or knowledge it's the same word here guard that retain the sound words measure everything according to the word but then guard the treasurer put this down guard the purity of the gospel we jot down Galatians 1 verses 6 and 7 Paul said I'm amazed to these believers you are so quickly deserting him who called you by the grace of Christ for a different gospel which is really not another there's no other gospel only there are some of you some who are disturbing you and want to distort the gospel of Jesus Christ there's lots of ways we won't get into them today to distort the gospel the gospel is described by the way in 1st Corinthians 15 if you why I don't know I don't means good news but what exactly is the gospel Paul lays it out verbatim in 1st Corinthians 15 what are the elements of the gospel having to do with the finished work of Christ who he was and what he did for us but there's lots of ways to pervert the gospel by adding things to it or by subtracting things from it listen to what Ravenhill said he said the sinner's prayer has sent more people to hell than all the taverns in America say well don't we do the sinner's prayer yes we do but the thought that somehow praying a prayer suddenly changes everything automatically because you say words is not what the Bible teaches in fact what we say in a sinner's prayer must be evidenced by our life not because we earn salvation that we asked for but we reveal whether or not we received it the Bible says we're to make our calling and election sure read 2nd Peter chapter 1 look at the qualities that he describes not because we earn it but the true reality is if I've received it I'll reflect these qualities read first job John writes this these things I have written to you who believe in the name", "of the Son of God that you may know you have eternal life well what are they well you should read first job to discover because he's describing the person who's really born again are those qualities true for you and me we can judge and we should art to judge ourselves the Bible says we ought to judge other people's salvation but we are to judge our own but we need to guard the purity of the gospel secondly guard it by live it out living out the reality of a change life jot down Philippians 2 and verse 12 a lot of people hear this verse the first time it bothers them it sounds like it's exactly the opposite of the theology of being saved by grace through faith and not of words so then my beloved just as you have always obeyed not as in my presence only but now much more in my absence look at this work out your salvation with fear and trembling sounds like you say man good luck with that one that's not what he's saying listen to me the next verse says for it is God who is within you to both will and to do his good pleasure God's working in you and here's the idea when you receive salvation God worked it in you might say you've given it to you now let it work out into your life don't let it just be something you believe but let it demonstrate itself in the way you actually live may that's the question we ought to ask each other as Christians so do you work out your salvation but this doubt number three guard it by giving it out like giving it out remember what Paul just said I can trust what I've entrusted to him for that day I know whom I believed and I've given him my life I've given him my future I've given him my eternity and I know I can trust him so here's the idea if you're saved you've trusted God with what you've deposited with him here's the question can he trust you with that which he has deposited in you what is he deposited in us remember what Paul says in 2nd Corinthians 4:7 we have this treasure in earthen vessels does that mean well the context is the relationship with God through Jesus Christ that's what he's talking about in verse 6 of second Corinthians for Christ is is how we know God and Paulding says it's the same God who said let there be light the God who made light come out of darkness is the", "one who has shone in our hearts in other words they were dark but now Christ is alive in us just like in Genesis 1 Christ has come alive in you you have relationship with the Lord we have this treasure what's the treasure salvation a relationship with the Living God we're sons of light and daughters of light we have this treasure in earthen vessels will play pots fragile now exactly precious items the old clay pots I remember when I was a kid I went into this field boy I lived in Yorba Linda and it was a huge field it's where migrant workers used to come and work the fields but it had long been abandoned and I found buried in the dirt those little clay pots that you buy you know at Home Depot for a flower and there were just stacks and stacks and stacks but they're all buried in the mud they'd been there for years and all I could see is changing changing and I was about seven Wow they sell these things and I'll steal them from the ground cuz nobody cares about them so I got a wagon went out there for days I was digging him up and bringing him home and I just was gonna go door-to-door selling clay pots and I found out why they were ain't nobody wanted my clay pots they're not worth anything my mom's them I just put them over there the garage with the other stuff yeah it's not exactly expressing how precious we are in ourselves but the idea is God has put the greatest treasure that's available into things that in and of themselves are just well destined for destruction why so the glory might go to God you see that's why by the way when God allows your life to break he's doing those around you a favor if you let him you know how the Dead Sea scrolls were found little shepherd boy Arab boy threw a rock into a cave out there in the Judean Desert by the Dead Sea and he heard pottery breaking and he went in and he found this treasure this treasure of a library of God's Word there in the 1950s coming from about the time the Jerusalem was destroyed in about 70 AD that took our understanding of God's Word the Old Testament back a thousand years and it was identical to descriptions we have there's a lot to say about it fascinating to me it was that breaking of the pottery that allowed the treasure to be found and so it with you God has placed his treasure", "within you so that when things go wrong when life breaks down your faith in God might come forth he wants to shine through you when you break but we are to guard the treasure if you will by giving it out I know that sounds kind of like opposites usually you guard a treasure by keeping it from others but this treasure loses its value unless it's shared and put this down in before let God's Spirit live within you did you notice there in verse 14 what he said guard through the Holy Spirit who dwells in us who dwells in us that's true if you're a believer to me Mary in the Gospels is a living illustration of how Jesus Christ comes to live in someone not just her you say what do you mean well the Holy Spirit she says how am I gonna ever I'm not I've never been with a man how am I gonna bear a son the Holy Spirit will overshadow you will conceive within you the life of Jesus Christ he'll be alive inside of you Mary and that life will grow it'll become obvious we say when a woman is pregnant you're showing can't hide it you know when when a woman first gets pregnant no one knows maybe including her tonight I prayed to receive Christ I didn't know anything was different at all but he was inside of me and if Christ is alive inside of you you'll start growing spiritually especially if you feed yourself the Word of God you're around believers and pretty soon you'll be showing but his goal isn't just to stay inside of Mary and his goal isn't just to stay inside of you but conceived by the Holy Spirit that's the only way a person becomes born again and has spiritual life the Spirit of God has to do that work when Christ is in you it's your treasure but his ultimate goal is to come out from you to be shared with a it's an incredible living illustration of what God wants but the Holy Spirit is to live within us listen you can be a without the Holy Spirit you can be a church member without the Holy Spirit you can have Christian values without the Holy Spirit you can be a very kind and nice and honest person without the Holy Spirit but you'll never be a child of God without the Holy Spirit jot down Romans 8 and verse 9 Paul says however you Romans Christians are not in the flesh but in the spirit if indeed the Spirit of God dwells in you but if", "anyone does not have the Spirit of Christ he does not belong to Christ in the tabernacle and in the temple there was a day when the Spirit of God inhabited it day before it was just a tent it was just a building one was pretty simple one was very elaborate one was relatively inexpensive the other one was outrageously expensive to build didn't really matter there was a day when God wasn't living there and there was a day when God moved in in the Old Solomon praised a public prayer of dedication for that place he had built for God to dwell we call it the temple the house and God's presence moved into it and his spirit filled the place up can I tell you that's exactly what God wants to do with your life he wants your life to be the place that is used for his glory he wants to live in you he calls your body a temple of the Holy Spirit so much so that the Bible says flee immorality just like Joseph did in the Old Testament run away from sexual sin why this is 1st Corinthians 6:18 for every other sin that a person can come in is outside the body but the immoral sins against their own body or do you not know if you're a Christian your body is a temple of the Holy Spirit who is in you whom you have from God you're not your own you've been bought with a price therefore glorify God with your body you've been made for the glory of God forever you're gonna live for the glory of God if you're a child of God but the question is will you your life your body glorify God now will you let the Spirit of God take over your life in such a way you see many Christians of course if you're a Christian and true cuz you have the Holy Spirit the question is do you have the Holy Spirit the question is does the Holy Spirit have all of you that's the there aren't Ephesians 1 Paul talking to them about salvation speaks of the Holy Spirit that was given to us as believers who sealed the work of salvation in our lives and a seal wasn't just to keep something together it was to actually put someone's mark they would seal an envelope they would seal a letter when Rome sealed the grave of Christ believe me everybody knew that's a Roman seal signed by the governor if you will that signet the Holy Spirit is called the seal of our Redemption he has called", "in Ephesians 1 the pledge of our inheritance what does that mean well it's an interesting word in the Greek it literally means a down payment or a deposit and the idea is that once you've come to Christ the Spirit of God living in you is the evidence to you and to others that you belong to Lord if you ever gone looking with somebody or maybe you're yourself to buy a new house and you went to one of these you know model homes where you see the way your home will actually never look but anyway yep you know it sails every way and you oh I think I'd like to buy what how would your available and you looked and there's this old soul little button soul total total total told and they're either all sold but we have another faith coming where we can raise the price a whole lot more and give you the same thing anyway yeah I've been there done that so that little button means somebody gave used to be a lot less used to be a thousand now it's at least five I think deposit in most places in other words they've got a deposit we're putting a sold sign on them that one is spoken for in fact this Greek word the Holy Spirit is used to speak of an engagement ring the idea is when a man is engaged once to get engaged I'm giving you a ring it's a promise you're spoken for I want everybody to know wave your wiggle I tried to hit on you you're spoken for and as a child of God that's what the Spirit of God is saying in you God saying you're mine I'm coming back to pick you up you're kind of on the layaway plan you know in the Old Testament in the book of Samuel we have a corrupt high priest by the name of Eli who has two wicked sons who are in the ministry by the way hophni and Phinehas they try to take the Ark of the Covenant out of the tabernacle in the battle against the Philistines thinking it'll be a good luck charm was anything but God allows the Philistines to win the battle and take the Ark of the Covenant the very most precious possession Israel had where God's presence dwelt in the Holy of Holies and it's lost on that same day that battle both sons of Eli hophni and Phinehas were killed in battle and when Eli hears about it he dies Phineas was married to a wife that was very pregnant and word comes of this", "horrific day the Ark of the Covenant God's own presence is gone taken by the enemy your brother-in-law and your husband are dead and even your father-in-law the high priest they're dead Bible says she goes into labor pains at the shock of it she gives birth and she's dying and they say don't don't worry you have a son yeah you know they didn't probably know she was gonna die or weren't sure but yes there's a lot of bad news but you at least have a son you know what she names that child Iike both we say Ichabod eek Ibaka both is the Hebrew word for glory means weighty weight some glory gone the glory has departed from Israel especially because the Ark of the Covenant was taken by the enemy God's Spirit wants to dwell in his people and bring war to Jesus Christ but we can so resist and quench the Holy Spirit nobody knows he's alive including us I think of Samson the Old Testament Samson who was greatly used by God but I say he was a he-man with a she weakness and he started using his gifting and strength for his own benefits you remember the story with Delilah how he didn't want to give away his little secret about his long hair being and Nazarite his covenant with God and finally she wears him down and he admits and it says his hair that's this covenant she cuts his hair off while he's sleeping and the Philistines come in and he had already beaten up a bunch of them on previous occasions when they did this but this time it says he got up to fight him like he had in the past and he King James risked not he knew not that the Lord had departed he was gone he had no power at all and I think what a tragedy when somebody gets to that place where they're so used to quenching the Holy Spirit they aren't even familiar if the Spirit of God wasn't in their life it would be exactly the same way that it is now a Baptist pastor a good guy once said to w8o sir if God would through the Holy Spirit tomorrow my church would function just the same we wouldn't even know he was gone well that's a tragic statement see without the person in the power of the Holy Spirit your life may be spectacular but it'll never be miraculous the Spirit of God comes to dwell inside of you to help you become all that God wants you to be to take of the treasure and to", "give it away yes to guard it as far as the gospel not allowing it to be corrupted but to share it and to live it it is the power it is the person of the Holy Spirit and you know what the primary evidence is that we have the Holy Spirit and he's filling us agape love not the gifts in operation not powerful preaching from the pulpit not the best program ever and more people coming you can have a huge church and be devoid of teaching true scriptures and truth sound doctrine can you know I'll just say this the largest churches in our country are not teaching sound many of them are teaching corrupt doctrine but false prophets will always be more popular with people so it's not the size of a church or a ministry that determines anything you need to judge it by what are we teaching are we teaching God's Word in balance faith yes but love there's a lost world and that's simply preaching at it and yelling at it is not going to save them that's not what Jesus did for the prideful Pharisees Jesus called them hypocrites had his strongest words for those that are broken and damaged in sin Jesus had his most incredibly gracious words for the woman caught in adultery I don't condemn you you're a prisoner of war you're not the enemy we need to be very clear about how to Minister the truth in love but I say God give us a healthy faith that's ministering the truth and a spirit of on behalf of our pastors and staff we want to

down and they were very restrictive last year we", "were going to camp until the last minute and the county up there said no way so we had to cancel but if you have never been it is an incredible time to be with each other in god's creation and we take at least one day to go down to the valley and see the sights how many of you have been to yosemite valley raise your hand okay several of you have never been there and it's one of god's beautiful creations i used to say i well this is back when we tent camp but i would say i live i feel like in black and white all year then one week of the year i live in technicolor as i go up to see the creation of god it's it's amazing so if you haven't been we'd love you to join us and then of course we have other things going up uh at camp itself just the the big it's a unique time to be in god's creation with god's people to worship the lord to study god's word and just to get enfolded in the family so i hope you'll take advantage of it i know these cabins will they're on your app you'll need to sign up there but once they're gone they're gone so please consider being a part of that you know our ladies uh about 210 of them are actually in the gymnasium right now doing our women's retreat finishing up uh with amber lee uh nice who's a comedian and uh a bible teacher i know those two kind of might not sound like they go together but they really do in her and i was i i was over serving dinner last night with some of the guys and what a blessing to see what god's doing among our women so if you're praying for your god's hearing your prayers if if laughter is medicine to the soul we have 210 women to a spiritual health spa this weekend and i'm excited about what god's going to do as a result i'd like you to open your bibles to hebrews chapter 13 hebrews 13 as we go verse by verse we're now uh in the final chapter of hebrews i don't remember when we started but some people date their you know attendance at our church based on what book we were in so some of you just came as we've already started it but uh some of you've been you were back in matthew or something beginning in verse 1 says let love of continue do not neglect to show to strangers for by this some have", "entertained angels without even knowing it remember the prisoners as though in prison with them and those who are ill-treated since you yourselves are also in the lord i thank you for this church i thank you for the love that i see being demonstrated all the time and in ways that are many times anonymous and many times quietly uh being lived out and it blesses my heart just as a christian much less as a pastor and lord we ask that you would just multiply that in our church today and in the days ahead that you would teach us to be living out the things that we're learning in scripture not just learning them but really understanding how to start living them if we haven't bless your word as we study it the women over there the children the youth the spanish ministry god your word when it opens i thank you that it's a hammer that shatters the rock and it's fire that burns the chaff away so lord we're here to hear from you we ask that you speak powerfully to our hearts in jesus name you can be seated the book of hebrews we have been studying it i have introduced it so many times i won't do that today except to say that most of the book of hebrews really is deep theology and it's fitted well because on wednesday nights we're going through the book of exodus and we're studying about the high priest we're studying about the tabernacle and how christ is pictured in all of those and that's why i want you to come out on wednesday nights i want you to from the old testament about our savior i want you to see our savior in the old testament and really it's not just worshiping jesus in the old testament it's discovering who you are in christ anytime we study the character of christ but in chapter 11 of hebrews we really the examples of the faith from the old testament that these this cloud of witnesses surrounds us those who have lived the life before us and many of those of course were all in chapter 11 taken from the old testament but the example of faith in chapter 12 of hebrews it was more about the encouragement to faith and in chapter 13 we now change the corner to the most practical part of the book of hebrews what we might call evidences of the faith just practical matters of faith in christ live itself out and the first three are going to be kind of associated but a lot of things we're", "going to read there it's almost like the book of proverbs it goes from this subject to that subject just telling us here's what faith looks like as we live it out and this is of course talking about relationships today so i've just called it faith in action but it's really faith and relationship so if you're taking notes put in the first word i want you to fill in if the time to do so put in the word saints we're being commanded now to express our faith in our relationship with each other so love the saints continually in verse 1 let love of the brethren continue now let me just say this to distinguish it from so many other commands where we're just told to love remember jesus said i'm giving you a new that you love one another as i have and of course it sounds a whole lot like the old testament command which is to love your neighbor as yourself but those different i think you know that love your neighbor as yourself if you're my neighbor and i want to love you the way that i love myself i make the sandwich i cut it in half and well you can have half because i'm going to love you the way i love myself but if i love you the way that christ loved me i'm giving you the whole sandwich you see the christ's example to us is to love sacrificially and as god's people that's not only his command it's actually what you might call i think it should be called the ultimate meaning we want an unbelieving world to believe in our savior we want to believe that he's alive from the dead that he changes lives and that he has changed us why do i say that it's the ultimate apologetic because by this shall all men know you are my disciples if you have love for one another not anything else where you voted in the last election they'll know you're my disciples he never said that no by this that you actually have agape love and i won't take the time most of you know there's a difference between what the bible calls love and what this world calls love this love talks about a feeling but the lord talks about an action and we are to love one another the way that god loved us interesting second century writer by the name of aristides he sent a letter to the pagan emperor hadrian and probably one of the most profound comments was made after he was called to go evaluate these christians", "he had been sent to spy them out and here's what he said he returned with a mixed report about christians but his immortal words to the emperor have echoed throughout history the writer says here's what he said behold how they love they are different than anybody you've ever seen the way they treat one another is amazing and i wonder how many saying that today they ought to and we ought to be a reason that they do some of you are familiar with the name he was a 20th century british he wrote a very famous essay back in entitled why i am not a christian and uh most of what he wrote in his essay why i am not a christian was what irrefutable arguments for rejecting listen it mostly focused not on jesus didn't rise from the dead nothing like what he focused on were the lives of christians he knew or had heard of who live far less than lives i'm not a christian because of the way the christians live mahatma gandhi famously and sadly said i like your christ i do not like your christians your christians are so unlike your christ someone once said the with most non-christians isn't that they any christians the problem is they do now that is so discouraging to think that there are so many judgmental and hypocritical christians that were disservice to the gospel but we need to remember something and that's this that people around us only hear about jesus they see us they only hear about him but they see me and you this the need according to this verse though please notice the distinction we're not being commanded to love each other we're being commanded to continue loving and the reason that i want to point that out is this it's not a command start loving each other it's actually keep loving one another because the clearly teaches if you're a child of god one of the evidences that you're born is you already do so if there's not a love for god's people uh oh better check it out it's one of the evidences of spiritual life in you and in first john 5 1 we're told this that which is born of god loves that which is has been born of god in other words i have three sons i did not have to teach my oldest son to love his brothers when they were born why it's just an innate thing for brothers and sisters to love their brothers and sisters when they're born now i know they hate each other and get into fights all", "that but their family and there's something unique about it and part of it is this the word that's used here brotherly love and of course you know that the city of philadelphia literally is supposedly the city of brotherly love that's an interesting study in history we won't get into because it was an utter failure but philadelphia is two greek words love of and we're being commanded here to love but it's not just to have brotherly love or to love like a brother it's because we are family is the idea by the way the word adalfass brother in is an interesting word it comes from the greek word delphus which literally means womb adal fass means from the same womb which is what brothers are brothers and sisters are you know when i was a young boy we decided we me in the neighborhood we were going to build a tunnel you know we didn't have video games we just did stuff man we just did all kinds of stuff some of it was legal stuff wasn't but this was legal we we got a shovel and we decided we're going to build a tunnel in my backyard because my parents didn't and we were going to build this and i had it all drawn up on a map where this is going to be we're going to go down we're going to go there's going to be this huge room and there's going to be the other rooms i think we got about three feet down and about a foot and a half in that's what gave up but but we worked on it for weeks digging it out and uh i'll never forget one of the boys that was back there with me he accidentally cut himself on something and he was bleeding and so i remembered the cowboy shows that we used to watch on tv i don't know i had seen it somewhere the rifleman or somewhere where and so i did i cut myself and i said here and we put our blood together boy this is before covet and we put our we put our blood together and we became blood brothers do you remember kind of a thing you've never done it you never will anyway if you think about it every person in this room that's been born again every man is my blood brother every woman is my blood sister because we share a blood me baby racist don't speak the same language totally different in dna but we share the same blood now because we're christians amen we have been changed forever and", "eternally so the idea here is love other people who have been born again obviously we're the level lost world but we need to start with those if you can't love other christians how are you going to love the world really would be the question mark puts this down fix if you have one the connection what i'm talking about here is your relationship with god's people put in the word faulty there are two things there are more but two that come to mind immediately that hurt us in terms of our to express love to each other and even have love for each other and they are distance and sin separation and sin story is told of a man who had been attending a church and then he just stopped going gee that happened still right and so the pastor it was a smaller church noticed he wasn't there so he visited the man and the man kind of knew why he was there and so he welcomed him in it was cold night he had a big fire going and he gave him a seat and he finally came in they sat down and the pastor just really didn't say anything at all about him not being a church he just spent a little bit of time with him and while they were sitting there he the pastor got up or went over to the fire and he took some of the fire tongs and he took out an ember that was on fire in the flame and he took it out and just put it on this burning ember and then he sat back and they continued talking and finally the pastor said it's time for me to go but i just want to do one thing and uh while they were sitting there that stopped burning became dead cold as you but before he left he picked up the tongues again and he just put it back into the fire and it immediately got on and then the pastor said i'm gonna be leaving and the man said you know before you go i just want you to know uh thank you for the fiery sermon i'll be in church next sunday it's called the silent sermon because is if you and i are going to be who god wants us to be and experience all that god has for us it happens in relationship to each other do you know that god has decided he didn't have to but he's decided that his people would be the way that he would the fullness of his presence the fullness of his power", "and by the way the fullness of his purpose in our lives you say what do you the fullness of his presence where two or more are gathered there am i in their midst it's not that you don't have the holy spirit he's in but you won't experience all of his presence unless you do it with other the fullness of his power what do you mean by that do you remember they had to on people to receive the holy spirit that's why simon the sorcerer tried to peter and john got to go up to the samaritans lay hands on them it's going to involve my people for the holy spirit to be fully working in your life that's the way god it would be it's one of the fundamentals hebrews says of the christian faith the leg on of hands the fullness of do you know that you're a member of the body of christ any one of my members if they're separated from my body has no purpose at all it can't function it it just dies we have been made to all that god has for us in relationship with each other and sin affects our ability to love each other jesus said it regarding the end times matthew 24 because listen to me iniquity will be increased or the love of many will grow cold by the way it's an interesting word in the original language it literally means will blow cold you ever had something hot you would let me degree by compromising degree the church will grow cold remember the lord said this my ear is not dull that it can't hear your prayers my arm is not short that it cannot save but your sin have made a separation between you and your god o israel it's always that way sin separates me from god and god is love first john 4 8. so i can't i don't have some reservoir of my own i can't give what i don't have i love because he first loved me so i have to stay in right relationship with to have a resource of love to have a responsible love even for him much less everybody else whose god is not god oh no if i'm going to love like jesus loved me i'm going to have to stay in right relationship with him so separation from and sin you know it says this in hebrews encourage one another day after day as long as it is still called today last time i checked it was lest any of hardened by the deceitfulness of sin", "we need to be with each other we get encouraged when we're with each other you know when it comes to thinking about us as a family i i don't think that should just be an a metaphor for the body of christ we need this is our eternal family this isn't just a word we use because hey we're like in the kiwanis club or you know like fred flintstone went to some club for a turtle guys this is actually this is more real of a family your relationship with god's people when i say more real it is eternal the people in my physical family i love them but if they don't know jesus i will not spend eternity with them and i don't have the most radical experience of being born again with them that's why jesus when he was told hey your mother and your brothers are looking for you what did he say who is my mother oh that'd be married no knew what he meant he didn't know who's my real mother my real brothers and sisters and he points to his disciples and he says are everyone who's willing to do the will of god that's my family and so it is that we are to have this unique relationship with each other that demonstrates us itself in an actual love we are called like a family then to do life together how much of a family would a family be who only got together to eat now i do know some of us we don't get to see each as families much unless we're eating relatives sons and daughters who have moved out but think of little children can you imagine if the only relationship you ever had with them was at a dinner table and yet maybe that's the extent of the relationship some of us have in this see you next sunday see you wednesday night we're gonna have a feeding and i'll be there you know call me whatever but not late to church or whatever will you jot down acts 2 42 this is a famous verse most of you know what they the early church filled with the spirit continually devoting it's one word in greek it means to be strong toward consistent that they were continually devoting themselves to the apostles teaching and then to koinonia the breaking of bread and let me just say a word about eating because i think we joke around a lot and i do and i'm going to stop i'm going to stop calling us calorie chapel why because i think you could get the", "wrong idea we don't eat together because we're godly gluttons but because it's biblical you say what do you mean we're a family and families eat together by the way people that love each other if you have somebody who has a problem with you and you need to meet with them you don't go out to dinner you will meet as briefly as possible you know on zoom or whatever you know so you can turn them off when you like somebody or you want to get to know somebody say hey let's go out d jot down acts 2 and verse this is the early church and day by day in other words every day continuing with one mind of the temple they broke bread from house to house they were taking their meals together with gladness and sincerity of heart jesus said if a shepherd has sheep and one's missing that one matters they don't go well i got 99. that's pretty good i have three sons when they were little we wouldn't go showed up for dinner i don't know the other one's four but maybe he'll show up tomorrow there are two questions asked by god in the book of genesis and i just want you to think the first was after adam and eve had sinned and were hiding themselves from the presence of god the question that god asked was literally in the hebrew man because that's what adam means man where are you god wasn't mad at adam and eve though they had sinned he wasn't he knew exactly where they were he wanted them to admit where they were and fellowship restored we need to have that heart when somebody's gone because we don't know why where are you i miss you slugger you should be at church you bad christian oh we miss you and by the way the second question perhaps is a little more telling when god comes to cain you remember the question that he asked cain where's your brother where's your brother and he lied and said i don't am i my brother's keeper the answer is so let me ask you covet's come it's taken a lot of people out it's taken some people far away from us only online i can't imagine watching you that have stayed with us through this god bless you i i don't know how hard that's been and going to church online and watching i want you to know we want you back we're waiting for you we will not stop waiting and praying that you can be restored here but we love you we miss you", "we need you and we pray that you'll be restored to our fellowship soon please send that message to everybody you know whether they're at this church or some other church or they're separated you know we're growing right because of how many churches didn't open how many churches still are struggling with being open i i don't want people to come here because they can't go to their church if god calls them here that's he's god he's the shepherd i will obey i want people to be in a healthy relationship with the body they've been called to and if they can't then come here but please get the word out to people you haven't seen in a while where's that one you know the 99 here we got some new people what about the ones that aren't where is your brother where is your sister well put this down we are to love the saints continually but we're to enfold strangers caringly now this is tough for us because we have a culture that says be careful about strangers be careful about the person who knocks on your door do you hate it when they knock on your door you go i don't know i've got rings so i don't have to ever what are you doing on my door i love you but what do you you know i mean i see you're trying to sell me something i can tell this was yesterday by the way i was very nice i don't want any i love you you know stranger danger i was a cop i would go into the schools and tell the kids right stranger danger put this down see visitors as your opportunity we're told here do not neglect to show hospitality the word hospitality is literally in the greek two words put together the love of strangers or the love of the love of visitors do not neglect to show hospitality to visitors or strangers for by this love have even entertained angels without knowing it now strangers people you don't know today maybe someone sitting next to you or somebody on your way out don't look at them as a duty to somehow love look at them as an the bible says in romans 12 13 we are to hospitality and the word is literally pursue it we're to run after it becky and i from time to time go down to laguna beach it's one of our favorite places to go because we love god's creation we love the ocean so we'll go down there to eat because we love having fellowship together", "and uh but there's one there's one hotel we go to down there it's called the montage the montage is out of our price range i don't need a in town anyway so i don't i've never stayed there but you can walk into their lobby and everybody thinks you're you know a guest and i can walk through their lobby down into the park that's public parked down below it's beautiful grounds but an interesting thing about that hotel i know nothing about their management but i know something about someone decided somewhere along the way here's what everybody who works for us is going to do when anybody who is either staying at the hotel or walking through our tail walks by any of the people who work at this hotel if they're a grounds person a person working on the room doesn't matter immediately they're to stop what if they're talking to somebody else or stop what you're doing acknowledge the person who's walking by you and just just be available to them greet them say something to them it's it's an interesting thing you feel like royalty or something like oh you didn't know that i was here thank you very much i mean everybody's acknowledging it and it's not disingenuous it's like i get paid extra there's nothing like that it just feels like they're the these are unbelievers probably this is an unbelieving company who's decided to do it for whatever motives they have but i think to myself the bible says we're to outdo one another in showing honor to each other we should make it a competition in a sense not really but we should say go for sharing and caring for each other and those that are among the world shouldn't be outdoing the church in this area but occasionally they do visitors are our opportunity to reflect the character of christ actually the word that's used here don't could be translated don't forget and the idea isn't so much that we're so selfish care about visitors it's just that we love being with each other with people and that's a good thing the word is actually that's used in the original language is a word that happened to be when jesus said to his disciples as they crossed the sea of galilee beware of the leaven of the pharisees and then they said to each other oh he said that because we forgot to bring bread that's always been a weird passage to me it's like he was talking about pharisees he's using a metaphor but you think he's saying you screwed up", "we forgot maybe it was just hard to hear him i don't know maybe they didn't hear the whole message be something about levin we didn't bring brad we're in trouble they weren't in trouble at all but the word that the disciples used was it wasn't that we were being mean-spirited or selfish we were just excited about getting to ride with jesus on a boat somewhere new we're with each other we're having a good time now the reason i tell you that the longer you're a part of a church family this or any other one there are blessings that come to you in relationship i see people that i know i many of you i know what's going on in your lives and i'm excited to see you i want to get caught up so it's very easy for all of us to focus on that and miss the opportunity of the person who doesn't know anybody do you remember your first day at kindergarten or a new school or a new job maybe your first day here maybe some of you it's your first day here you feel like everybody knows and maybe there's half a dozen people around you they don't know anybody else either they're brand new too but you just feel alone it's kind of when i took my second son to it was an exciting day for him and always an exciting day for a five or six year old to start school walk down there with our boy and every every parent is there with their little you know just excited too and nervous and and it came that point where the kids all needed to file into the room and i remember valor was like what do you mean i said go with the teacher now go on in there and so he walked in and then he sat down and he started looking and this terror came over his eyes he was going come here that was he was sitting down my backyard says i could say it's like i felt like i was child abusing right then and the teachers are going goodbye now we get older and we cover it over more but sometimes that's exactly the feeling that people have i don't know anybody is this where i should even be is this going to be a place i could be known and loved and cared for and guess what the very that someone often has maybe it's in the parking lot maybe it's as they walk through the doors if we think the greeters and the ushers they are it's", "their job make them feel loved i hope they did because i'm not going to hey listen they are our opportunity to listen to me not just to obey this command but to reflect the love that we've already experienced in jesus christ to love those that are at a distance from us is our way of love to god now there are some people who misunderstand this verse about to think that every stranger you never could have wings under that jacket you know some pick up every hitchhiker because they think well might be an i would not recommend that the only angel i know that i've ever met is my wife and other than that i've never seen though i do believe in angels but jesus said strangers are our chance to minister to him remember this is matthew 25 i was a stranger and you took me in by the way the word to take in is an interesting word it's the word that's used of a net in the gospels being cast out to gather fish you took me in in other words fish don't jump out of the water into your boat they're not looking even to be caught they would just as soon never be caught but you took me and you actually initiated a relationship with me i would been known to you i would have never taken the first step to know you but you took that first step jot down exodus 23 and verse 9 if you would exodus 23 9 god said this you shall not a stranger since you yourselves know the of a stranger for you also were the land of egypt you say well i was never a strand i've grown up at this church my parents grew but here's the idea spiritually god is telling his people you at one time were in egypt and you were in a foreign country they all spoke a different language a different culture than you you were always the odd man out your whole life until i saved you strangers are our opportunity to love as god loved us jot it down in ephesians 2 verses 12 paul said this remember that you were at that time separate from christ you excluded from the commonwealth of israel strangers to the covenants of promise you had no hope you were without god in the world but now in christ jesus you formerly were far off have been brought near by the blood of christ now there are some people that just might be scary i think of paul when he first got saved", "remember what the bible tells us we know he got radically saved we know jesus met we know that ananias wasn't too excited about praying for him to be healed so he could see it i'm sure he thought well if he's a christian maybe we should just get him you know some help but let's not give him his sight because who knows what he'll do with that but he didn't want to even pray for his healing but jesus said no he's one of mine you go pray for him i'm going to use him in a powerful way paul goes to damascus things don't go really well there by the way i think a lot of people have this misunderstanding paul when he got saved he was just this and he was doing everything right oh no read what happened in damascus he he was bold there's like a bull in a and he barely gets out alive out of damascus and he'll eventually the church will have to send him away just to get some peace to be honest with you but he goes to jerusalem and he decides it's time to go hang out with the apostles why not well remember the apostles weren't too interested in hanging out with him except for one person do you remember who that bridge was barnabas which by the way is not his name that's his christian nickname barnabas literally means son of and while the apostles didn't want to barnabas believed this guy's really saved so here's paul coming to jerusalem wanting to hang out with the christian leaders they're not interested and barnabas takes them brings them to the apostles introduces and shares what god has done through his life and that's how barnabas begins a pardon me paul begins a relationship with the apostles of jesus christ now the rest is literally history you know what we need more of in the church we need barnabasses and we need people who see this is and there is a gift of hospitality but we shouldn't go that's not my gift oh no we're all called this isn't just for those with the gift this is i want you to jot down genesis 18 first five verses because the writer to the hebrews makes reference to probably this passage when he says some have entertained the lord appeared to abram by the oaks of memory where he's living while he was sitting at the tent door in the heat of the day and when he abram lifted up his eyes and three men were standing opposite him and when he saw them", "he ran from the tent door to meet them bowed himself to the earth and he said my lord and by the way it's not capitalized because it just means sir he doesn't know that these are angels and the lord he just sees strangers if now i have in your sight please do not pass by your please let a little water be brought wash your feet rest yourselves under the tree i'll bring a piece of bread that you may refresh yourselves and after that you may go on since you have your servant and they said so do as you well we're not going to teach on this passage but this is the example that's being referenced here two angels who will go down by the way to check out sodom and gomorrah and the lord himself abram has no idea they just look strangers to him do you know what he does to strangers he runs out to meet them they would have walked right on by he runs out he humbles himself calls himself a servant more than once and then he says this give me the privilege of serving you did you hear him let me have the favor of and i i would count the greatest privilege to serve you let me go get some water for your feet let me get a piece of bread he does a whole lot more he gives him a whole meal giant meal he just sees this as a great opportunity to love a total stranger he has no idea he's ministering and to the lord himself and that's exactly what the word of god says when you love somebody you have no obligation see that's the story of the good samaritan he had no obligation to stop of anybody the jewish people should do that for the jew who's been beat up yeah the the priest should do that the zero expectation in anybody's mind you don't do it because you have to you know do it because pastor bob preached we can get to this thing where we only do we only love each other when we're and we only do it in the right ways i heard of a a church they we're going to have something called friendship sunday gonna be friendship sunday this man got up turned around to a lady he didn't know the church said hi she said that friendship stuff starts okay i need to work on that but i do want to encourage you because i hear testimony after testimony of people have stayed at this church because", "stepped out to say hi can i help you can i show you around remember their name now some of us don't do great at that you don't have to be able to memorize their name to love but it's a incredible way to minister to the saints who are new put this down serve the suffering compassionately he goes on to say this in verse three remember the captives or the prisoners as though in prison with them and those ill-treated since you yourselves also are in the body jot down deuteronomy 15 15 if you would you shall remember that you were a slave in the land of egypt and the lord your god redeemed brought you out of slavery therefore i command you this today jesus said this he quoted isaiah when he went into the synagogue and he said here's my mission he just quotes the bible isaiah 61 the lord has anointed me god's anointed me to preach good news and one of the things he came to do was the captives to make set the captives free now we always think about that in a and that's absolutely true that's the in which christ came is to deliver us from captivity but to minister to the prisoners is something that the lord has called us to do by the way jesus says that again remember i was in prison i wasn't just a stranger i was in prison and you came to me and visited me put this down persecuted for their faith i don't know if you noticed the commands here but they're getting a little bit further out harder to do love each other that's actually the easiest to do and sometimes that always isn't so easy right remember the old saying to dwell above with the saints we love that'll be glory but to dwell below with the saints we know that's another story because there are people that are harder to love and they're put into our lives on purpose so god will say well god you love everybody that's kind of like you that likes you how about this one yeah lord that's just for you you know i love him but i love him in jesus but i don't like him very much yeah that's not love at all but love your neighbor love your other believers start there but then love the believers the people that are coming among you who you don't now love the people who aren't there at all who have needs because of something that's happened in their life shut down colossians 4 18 listen to what paul said himself hi paul", "this is one of his prison epistles i paul write this greeting with my own my imprisonment grace be with you paul's in prison he says don't forget me just because i'm not around and also hebrews 10 verses 32 and 34. hebrews 10 32-34 he says recall the former days he's talking to these people in this book the former days in which after you were illuminated you got saved you endured a great struggle of sufferings partly while you were made a spectacle both by reproaches and tribulations and partly while you became companions of those who were so treated for you had compassion on me in my chains and joyfully accepted the plundering of your goods knowing that you have a better and enduring possession for yourself in heaven these are somewhat foreign to unless we go find them out we'll never to uh voice of the martyr ministry and open doors every day 13 are killed because of their faith did you not 13 people will die every 24 hours because of their faith in christ every day 12 churches or christian buildings are attacked and every day 12 christians are unjustly or imprisoned and another five are abducted that's happening all over the world 348 million christians are persecuted for their faith and live somewhere where they are one out of eight in the entire world even if we feel like that is so foreign to us the fact is it's happening i want to commend a ministry to you called open doors how many of you have ever heard of open doors good i want everybody to hear about open doors because open doors this is their entire ministry to help us obey this verse i think it's pretty important to say a word about them uh it is through open doors ministry you can hear of christians who right now are being persecuted for their faith not just generally but specific names so 48 hours ago i spent a little time in by prayer praying for a man named adam who's looking at a 30-year sentence it'll be decided in the next 30 days pray for adam because he shared his he came to faith as a muslim came to christ and now he is being persecuted because he's led other people to christ and help some people get out of the country because of and he is being falsely accused their for adam there is by the way an app and i didn't know this until it turns out there's somebody in our church who works for open doors works in the so as i posted something about open", "doors he private messaged me and said hey by the way i work in technology it's a great ministry let me know if you need anything i thought great i'm so thankful for your so there's an app download it it'll give a daily person to pray for or an area of the world to pray for where you can say yes i've prayed and you will be reminded of people that are believers who are suffering if you want to obey this verse i hope you do i do i want to start being reminded what's going on outside of the united states and outside of the areas of our comfort zone but if we're going about them biblically it has to start with becoming informed yes you can i'm not asking you to donate to their ministry but one of the wonderful thing is i was able to write a note of encouragement to adam in saudi arabia that will be delivered and by the way pray for this he told me this is an inside story that uh next they're hoping to actually by technology from around the world with video chatting the person who's being if they can have that kind of communication they're hoping to use technology to improve our capacity to be in relationship with them incredible and i'm all for that kind of a thing happening um now in second timothy paul the writes to pastor timothy and he speaks of those who have been taken captive by to do his will so while we're talking about caring for prisoners we need to realize there are different kinds of prisoners there are some believers who have been put in jail for their faith they need to know that they're not by us there are others who have been put because they're not living by faith they've lived in sin and that's why they're there they need to know that they can be forgiven there are still others who are lost many who are lost in the prison system and they need to know the gospel and the grace of god onesimus got saved because paul was in prison did you know that the praetorian guard heard the gospel because paul was in prison so we need to be praying for believers who are persecuted that god will increase their strength and faith to the test of time but to be a good witness where they are now having said we also recognize that some people are in prison if you will they're in they're not in a prison or a jail but they're still in bondage they're captives according to", "led by satan to do his will because of all kinds of problems maybe some here maybe some that we know maybe some watching some people you know there are some that are in captivity to addiction others that are in captivity and depression still others are in captivity to their own guilt and their shame because of things they have done the good news is for us as believers we need to realize god has us the key in the truth of the word of every single prison that people are in do you believe that it's not just you can be saved and go to heaven that's the big one but there's lots of other places people need to be set free jesus and you'll know the truth what will the truth do it will set you free and that's true you are forgiven you can overcome this in jesus name so it's important that we realize there are people in jail maybe you have a son or a daughter and they're far from the lord and maybe they're a christian maybe they're born again are you going i don't know if they're born again the way they're living i don't know they did pray that i did see i don't know there's a lot of question marks on some people's lives because their life doesn't demonstrate it you don't know if they need to get saved or need to get sanctified but they need the savior to work amen and so we need to be at work pray you know when peter was in prison the bible says peter's being taken to prison he's going to be executed the next day but the church started praying they gathered and they prayed and they didn't until god chose to send an angel and release him there are people that can be free if the church will act and i believe with all my heart the lord's teaching us we've got to see people that are in prison i don't just mean physical prisons but those two the example of scripture was an actual prison but those prisons of their heart the prisons of their habits are going to be broken through faith and prayer we'll put this down help the hurting now in verse 3 the first word you might circle it or underlining because i want to say a word about is remember the prisoners as though in prison with them when we use the word remember it's a mental word we say well don't forget john he's up at san quentin nothing wrong with that we should care about him leave him on your prayer list", "but can i tell you something about the word remember used in scripture it's not just think about somebody remember when noah builds the ark puts animals on it the floating first floating zoo and his family god brings the storm 40 days and 49th entire world is destroyed and here is noah and his family on the ark for five months and god's not saying you can go back and read it god says nothing they're just out there and ever i'm sure there's a like well how how how long will this ride does this cruise where's the port of and then suddenly it says and the lord remembered noah now i don't get that it's like god's up there going well i've been busy running the universe i know what oh no i forgot about you it's not like that because the next part of the verse says and god caused a wind to pass over the earth and that was a huge win for the whole world what is god gonna do he's gonna evaporate the water slowly day by day it's not gonna happen like that it's not gonna be some miracle but god remembered and he sent to in other words he's starting to care practically for the problem in this little prison that noah and his family jesus saw the multitudes the bible says downcast and downtrodden as sheep without a shepherd and moved with he said pray the lord of the harvest to send forth laborers and then jesus brought his disciples together and he sent them out to to those multitudes you know it's been you can pity a man or a woman and watch them die in the gutter that's too bad that's awful but you cannot have compassion biblical compassion without getting moved that's why it says it moved with not just oh that's terrible what am i going to do about it the compassion of christ moves us into action just like remembering noah meant i'm going to do something about the condition that's why it says in james 1 remember the widow and the orphan just know about them just pray for them meet their needs that is the biblical according to scripture jot down luke 6 31 you say i don't know what to do for here's your answer of how to find out luke 6 and verse 31 we call it the golden rule jesus said and just as you want people to treat you treat them in the same way if you will take that verse practically and apply it to anybody you know who's suffering it's very easy what would i want done", "if that were me i'm in the hospital by the way dan watt was in a terrible bicycle accident he almost died some of you know he's the worship leader he's at a medical center he almost didn't make it he's survived we are so grateful to god some of you don't even but you have to ask yourself the question here's what we need to ask what would i want what would i want to be just forgotten hope someone's praying for me someday or what i want someone to tell me they love me what i want they can't change the fact that i've got a lot of rehab to go through it's going to be a my wife's struggling and thankful i'm alive but they're practical problems we need to ask the question if you want to know what to do if you really want to know what to do you ask yourself that if i were in prison what would i want god's people to do and as soon as you answer that question you know exactly precisely what god's you to do it's an amazing verse to help it's not just the golden rule we should all live by it's practically what we need to do to honor god god help me to do that you know when i was told in 1990 that there are christians who are suffering not just persecution in but isolation because they're completely there was no internet at the time there was no way to communicate to them yet they didn't have phones you couldn't do much more than write a letter and it may never get there in korea north north korea at the time communist russia and then also in cuba and so we started this as a church to say you know what well we can write i don't know if they'll get through we can send photographs in our in our and and you know i don't know that we can relieve much suffering but we can at least let them know you're not alone we know you're there we love you to our brothers and sisters we chose a church a little church tiny little pentecostal church in downtown havana and we thought we'll probably never meet him i was still a cop it's against the law at that time to go to cuba and so we are just going to write and pray but we're going to send pictures of ourself let them know there's a church in america we love you guys and if we can be of any help the lord started working through those letters", "and finally it came to a realization if we're going to love them we can't just letters we need to meet them face to we need them to know that god has not forgotten them and we haven't either and so we needed to go so three of us myself and two brothers from our church went to havana cuba we went with a love we went with some clothing we went with some medicine we went with some literature for the pastor because he didn't have a good biblical library and we we just took in what we could we knew would be a one-time trip we knew we could be arrested actually by our own government but we decided it was so we went there that was the mission in fact we weren't allowed to talk about jesus we were told by the organization that oversays do not share the gospel you'll go to jail you'll endanger the entire mission don't do that on the streets you can talk in private but not on the streets so we went we delivered the gifts they were blown away they wept they said you're our sons me and these two other older men you know you're my sons this lady has this pastor's wife has no sons or children of she said just thank you so much for not forgetting about us and we were heading back to our hotel many of you know this that god put a couple of young cuban men on our wawa a wawa was what they call their public bus system at the time we're going back to our hotel at midnight and we had been told do not don't interface with people on the streets almost everybody reports to the government there's spies everywhere so even if they're nice to you don't talk to them first thing they did is started talking to us one of them spoke a little english and he said you know do you guys have any cigarettes i said nope and i said i thought that was the end of that conversation he says uh how about uh do you have pesos uh for dollars we would like to see u.s dollars if you'll uh trade for pesos cuban pesos well we already knew that dollar that a cuban has in their possession if they're arrested they get one year in prison that's how serious it was so he said no we're not going to trade money with you so when we got off the bus at our hotel we thought it was all about midnight where we start heading to the", "hotel and i look back there's these two guys they're following us and they were in their teens but one of the friend of the guy that's doing all the english talking he's this huge guy i mean a big guy and they're walking after us trying to engage us in conversation well on this corner of a street he started telling me the guy who spoke english he said so you're americans aren't you i said yeah he said you know i got to be honest with you i would never want to live in your i said oh really he said no he said it's not safe to do in your country what we're doing right now walking down the of our city i said well actually this it is safe where i live he said oh really i didn't know that he said well you guys got to pay for your education there i said well actually it's free until you get to college he had been told a bunch of lies about our country anyway we had this little chat he asked me what i thought of the girls in cuba because there were two prostitutes walking by and i said well we're not here for that and then he just looked at me and said why are you here then and i thought okay do not preach the that jesus said make disciples of all so which one do i choose i said well we're christians and he goes i've heard of those said something about the cross or something i said yeah he said what do you guys what are you doing here uh i said you know what i want to tell you need to come to my hotel tomorrow morning we're leaving i don't know that we're ever coming back here but if you really want to know because i knew he couldn't get to our hotel except that he'd get up early on the bus and go there he'd have to really want to and so he said i'll be there and so he and his friend got up early dressed all up nice got to our hotel about an hour before we had to i was shocked to see them and his name was richard and i said richard sit down with me in fact they would not the hotel would not even allow them to talk to me in the lobby because they were cubans they only who have money to enjoy the lobby so we and for an hour i just laid out the gospel as clearly as i could english is his second language but he understood", "and i shared with him the gospel of jesus christ and he was translated the to his friend osmel the big guy at the end of which i invited them to pray to receive christ they both did they were blown away he was crying i gave him a new testament i said we're leaving i don't know that we're ever going to come back but here's fast forward god called him into the ministry he started the first calvary in cuba of havana he's been pastoring oh by the way it gets better osmael he attends this church he's married to one of the gals from our church who used to go over on the mission talk about they got together god put together a beautiful family here in anaheim that's not why i went there i went there because i wanted to obey this command to care for christians who are suffering and god has done so much more than i would have ever god is miracles to do in your life if take these commands are not just something you ought to do but a blessing that god wants to bring into your life as a result of obeying them now it's almost time to close but i want to do something i've never done i want to ask you to make a commitment in front of each other i'm not going to call you forward but i'm going to ask you if you want to make a commitment to the lord with his help to live out these commands not just to hear them they're not so strange to your ears but to say god i don't know how to in another country i don't really know how to do a better job with strangers maybe i'm a little uncomfortable meeting people for the first time or maybe i'm a how could i obey that one here so i'm going to ask you if you believe is a call to a change of life and not just to a change of understanding if you're a christian well first of all i just want everybody to stand just i'm not asking you to say you're standing to make the commitment but you see when i was when i became a police officer the two times i became a police officer the chief of police would bring me into his office and i'd have to raise my right hand and swear of course to uphold the laws of the state of california and the laws of the constitution i'm not going to ask you you're already american citizens but there's something called posse comitatus", "it's a latin term it has to do with the function of the sheriff it's been around since the 9th century ad where a sheriff had the authority to take citizens and make them part of the law enforcement in that county i don't need you to join the law enforcement other than defending them rather than defunding them but i do want to ask if you'll make a commitment today to obey these commands so if you're a child of god if you're a believer and you're saying lord i want to learn how to do that raise your right hand and repeat after me i promise to love the saints to enfold the and to serve the suffering with by the power of the holy spirit for the glory of god so help me god praise the lord let's stay standing and to close the service with worship in one of the things we're studying on wednesday nights is how the high priest represents the lord and how his sons are garbed and clothed with the same garments of authority and what we're emphasizing in wednesday nights and what we're studying is learning god you've called us to represent you not just the pastors not just the elders all of us our priests so these commands are not for somebody else in this room they're for me and you and you say well you're the pastor i agree but i need to learn to grow in these things too it's a joy to meet believers and and yes i have a doorway in because i can walk up to somebody who i've never met and some people go oh you're pastor they may not say that to you all the to take the faith to say i want them to know that i love them you oh turned great things paul the apostle said this to the church of thessalonica now as to the love of the brethren you have no need for anyone to write you for you yourselves are taught by god to love one another for indeed you do practice it and this is how i feel about you you do practice it to all all those in the area in macedonia in their case but we urge you brethren excel still there's plenty of room to grow in this area i am not discouraged at all by the love that i see in this church i just want people to be able to say what aristide said in his day behold how they love one another amen now may the lord bless you and keep you", "may he make his face to shine upon you and be gracious unto you may he lift up his countenance and give you his peace in the name of the father and the son and the holy spirit he has done faith see how his love overcomes you free every through every storm you'll be faithful forever and i know that you'll do it again for your promises yes it ain't it you will do jesus our savior lord jesus our savior your name lifted i oh god you have done great things forgot you to be got you to pray things you pledge yourself to kindness makes us rid of all her shame you will be praised you will be praised never be on my lips i see your face the colors of who you are you're beautiful now you are sitting on your heavenly front and soon you will be coming oh i've seen that verse again let's sing it i see you there your bride will come together amen it's good to sing it's good to know where true beauty is you know he's the thing in this entire universe and beyond and we need to turn our focus to him and worship him because it's definitely worth it for us to worship him but first and foremost we want to worship him because he is worthy of it amen and uh that's our future when we arrive on eternity shore where death is just a memory in fact definitely won't even be a memory it'll just be gone it'll be done he'll wipe every tear from our eyes and we will spend eternity worshiping the king of glory amen yeah so you guys can grab a seat uh something awkward happened today we all showed up wearing the same shirt did not plan it at all no i'm happy to to be the first one to tell you that we're doing bless fest again here at the which is huge and uh and so you'll hear a lot more about that later on in the service but i'm blessed to be a part of a family not but a family and i hope that's how you feel when you walk into this place and uh a family needs to gather outside of just an hour a week right and so tonight we want to give you an opportunity to be together a little bit and so we launched last week our summer um and yeah i'm glad that at least four were very excited about that and hopefully more of you this week you know like well it's father's day i don't know we're sleeping", "or something i don't know so uh but no we had hundreds come out last week and check it out we had four people make commitments to jesus christ which was a huge and we had chad williams out and it was just such a cool thing you can see a lot of what was going on uh we have food tonight at 5 00 pm we're gonna have navarro's tacos out uh with william navarro always delivering some really good food and so super cheap like five bucks for like a whole taco plate and then uh after that at 6 00 pm we're gonna have service in here we have a very special worship leader guest that's coming and he's actually in here somewhere sitting around here and uh he uh is flown down from seattle and boy are his arms tired and no sorry and uh to be with us he's a good friend of mine and he's actually written a few of the songs that we sing here in the church and so you're going to be blessed by him and then we also have a special guest that i'm going to interview uh you may be familiar with the instagram account preachers and sneakers yeah and uh he's kind of sparked a conversation in the church it was just a joke he took a picture of a famous worship leader wearing like 800 shoes and he posted he's like how much we paint our worship leaders up here and everybody thought that was pretty funny and then he unearthed kind of a cultural zeitgeist it's like a lot of people not in the church but in the world uh have been looking on the church and something's going on there it seems like it's just all about glitz and glamour well he has a heart for the gospel and calling people back to say you know what no no church is not about glutes we use everything to glorify the lord but the church is about gospel not glamour amen and so tonight i'm going to interview him which is because we're launching bless fest this morning talking about taking care of the we're going to be in james chapter 2 which talks all about not forsaking the poor in honor of the rich man and so i'm going to interview him it's a great opportunity for you to invite somebody that does not yet know the lord chances are maybe they've heard of this funny instagram account and you say hey we're going to interview this guy we're going to have a conversation about this", "and you can bring him in buy him a plate of food and then we're going gonna dig into james chapter two and i'm gonna give them an opportunity at the end of the message to jesus christ as the lord and savior and so it's a great opportunity to do that to stretch your gospel legs get out invite people we have flyers as you leave to use as a tool for that but hope to see you guys tonight but we're going to hey maybe tonight is your night just get out of your house come here we love you we miss you we want you to be here um i know that a lot of you have reached out and said hey thanks for including us in the service even though we can't be in the house together um you're in your house and god is gonna meet you this morning and so just be open to what he wants to do sing these with pure full intention to glorify him he will meet you make him the center point of your room and so if you're at home or in the room here the bottom of the screen there's going to be a link that pops up in which we facilitate giving through calvary chapel and i say it a lot but it's completely true we don't solicit giving we just facilitate it because it's an opportunity for you to make a decision in your heart how you want to honor the lord here this morning we're going to sing songs we're going to dig into his word we have an opportunity to hear about bless fest and all the things that god's doing opportunity to bring people that don't know the lord and there's an opportunity say it's better in your hands than it is in mind amen and so we want to give you an opportunity to do that if you have the calvary chapel you stand on him app you can use that or there's agape boxes on the wall as you leave and so let's commit our time to the lord let's sing a song of praise a song of not only in the past but we know yet and still to come amen lord thank you for your faithfulness thank you for what you've been doing in and through this body of believers i this morning we would take hold of what you have for us or that we would sing with nothing held back not just so our voices could be but so that our intentions can be made known that we want to", "glorify the living god who is on his and we can get excited about a lot of things lord but we want to be most who you are and what you've done and so help us to do that now through singing through giving to the reading of your word to the study and application of it to our hearts that it may change the way that we think lord we thank you we praise in jesus you're walking around these walls i thought by now they'd fall but you have never failed me you're waiting for change for you have never failed me your promise still stands great is your faithfulness i'm still in your hands this is my confidence you've never failed me so keep me within your again oh yes you your will still stands for great is your i'm still in your hands your promise still sad for great is your this is my confidence no you've never failed me you've never failed you've never when there was no way oh i see you i

fingerprinted today right after service you can get your fingerprinting done which we need you to do before you can be confirmed to serve so please take advantage of that down in children's like you open your bibles to hebrews 13 are now in the final chapter somebody informed me when we started hebrews this because i i know sometimes people go to our church date themselves how long have you been coming to church i don't know i think it was the book of and they do it based on where they were but it's been a couple years hebrews 13 beginning in through verse 3 says let the love of the brethren continue don't neglect to show strangers for by this some have", "without even knowing it remember the prisoners as though you were in prison with them and those who are ill-treated or abused since you yourselves also are in the body father we want to do more than hear a sermon we want to do more than go to church we want to allow your spirit to speak to and we are inviting you now to speak to our hearts so lord some of us in the room are distracted by what we're going to do later today others of us because of the problems that we're facing at home in our personal lives and we know that our hearts are disturbed within us the lord we also to you what we believe your promise you are faithful and although we have in ourselves and in people we're not disappointed in you so lord we want to allow you to have reign right now we want to hear what you would say to us about how to equip us to minister to each other even when we feel like we're the ones who need the ministry teach us what you want us to know that we might reflect you honor you and be built up to serve you this week in jesus name amen you can be seated i like what the psalmist said he said why art thou disquieted within me why are you disturbed within me he's talking and sometimes as christians we need to do that we're going yeah i'm not happy i'm just you know i'm not i can't put on a smiley face and pretend or i'd be a phony and the lord knows when we're going through times and we feel like i know that god's faithful and i know he's gonna take me but i still have to go through it and uh you know so if you're here and you're hurting i'm just grateful i know we love you and that god loves and has a plan for how to walk you through that i like what uh it was max lucado years ago who said this and i really agree with him he said i think he wrote a book called he still stills storms and i like that you know jesus is in the business of stealing storms in but what i love is this truth that a lot of times in the life of a believer when we're going through something horrendous a storm if you will he could he could just change it and that's what we're always asking lord stop it stop this person from doing this he said but while god can steal storms", "quite often what he does is he stills the storm in the heart of and he lets the storm outside rage and i do believe that's true it's not because he can't but the greater work is for us to trust god in the midst of the storm than to be able to praise him when it's over amen so if you're in the midst of it just know that god can do that he wants to give you peace inside and that's the greater miracle and i hope and pray he does what you would prefer but let's agree what he prefers is best hebrews 13 well we've been studying hebrews for a while and we're now in the chapter 11 of hebrews gave us those what we would call examples of faith right that great a cloud of witness that surrounds us that our men and women who lived without their lives by faith died for the lord who went before us not just in the bible in the old testament but really in our own lives so examples of faith chapter 12 we're more to faith but when we get into chapter 13 we might call this chapter the evidences of faith really just practical that are ways in our normal everyday we can demonstrate our faith you might say you're going to see where the rubber of faith meets the road of our relationships with each other today in the body of christ so i've called it faith in action if you're taking notes put in the word saints because we're going to look at three different levels of relationship within the body of christ and how we are to demonstrate our faith and particularly our love hebrews 13 verse 1 take a look at it in your bible let love of the brethren continue so love the saints continually now before we just rush through this verse because we're often told in the bible to love one another and rightly we should remember jesus said this is the great commandment the great commandments are to love god with all your heart soul mind and to love your neighbor as yourself that's from leviticus in the old testament and those are the two great commandments upon these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets but jesus said a new commandment i give to you and a lot of times christians hear the new commandment sounds a lot like the old he said i want you to love one another as i have loved you now you know the difference i hope right when it says love your neighbor as", "if i love you eve as myself and i'm making lunch something that you like and i make a sandwich if i love my neighbor as myself i'm willing to cut the sandwich in half and give you half because i'm loving you because i love but if i'm gonna love you or anyone else as christ loved me you get the whole sandwich because he gave up his whole life there's a so this idea of loving one another is commanded all through the bible and especially in the new but notice it says let the love of the it's actually not a command that we start loving each other it's actually a command to not quench the holy spirit and stop loving one another see it's very easy to sing kumbaya to camp and we all love each other it's amazing but then we get to know each other the bible says to dwell above with the saints we love the bible doesn't say this that's a misquote it's been said to dwell above with the saints we love that will be glory but to dwell below with the saints we know that's another because sometimes there are brothers and sisters that are harder to love and god wants those people in our life on purpose to show us that not everybody is lovely including us in some aspects but the love of each other is actually what i would call the ultimate apologetic now you know what the word apology in the bible means i'm sorry but it's an answer be ready to give an answer the words apologia in the greek there's no g sound like we use it apologia an answer a defense a reason for your and so when you hear of apologetics it's usually proof that jesus rose from the dead and proof that you know the the bible's inspired but the ultimate apologetic is interesting jesus said by this shall all men know you're my disciples if what you love one another that will demonstrate your my disciples more than else not if you vote conservative in every election that's not what he said if you love one another everyone will know you're my disciple interesting thing the beginning of the the emperor in rome at this time was hadrian by the way no friend of the church he persecuted the church but he sent a man by the remain by the name of aristides to go and spy on the christians and to bring back a report to him about their lifestyle by the way i posted on my facebook page a longer part of the letter it's fascinating", "especially as regards to this particular study we're in today but after seeing them arisities return with a mixed report but his immortal words to the emperor have echoed down through history quote here's what he said to hadrian behold how they love one another they love one another and he goes into great detail to describe how they love one another and you would think christine's was looking at hebrews 1-3 because these are the exact areas that he talked about some of you know many of you might not know the name bertrand russell he was a 20th century british heathen um he wrote his most famous essay in 1927 entitled why i am not a christian don't recommend it uh in that essay he presents what he considers irrefutable arguments for rejecting christianity you would think they might have to do with the fact that it's not historical jesus didn't rise from the dead there were no miracles oh no it's none of that he focused instead on his essay why i am not a christian on the lives of christians that he had known or had heard of who lived far less exemplary lives than you would expect in other words the failure of people who claim to be christians caused him to say i want nothing to do it was gandhi who famously said quote i like your christ i do not like your christians your christians are so unlike your christ so he rejected christianity it's been said the problem with most christians are pardon me the problem with most non-christians isn't that they don't know any christians the problem is that they do now those are hard words to hear but the fact is we are called to love one another and jesus said it's going to be the way they know that you are followers of me we need to remember that people can only hear about jesus they see us they can only hear about them they see us so we need to learn how to keep doing what we're supposed to do by nature as believers you say what do you mean well the bible argues this in first john chapter 5 if you're born of god you will others who are born of god in other words love of believers comes naturally supernatural it's kind of like this when my son jesse had his first younger brother when valor he automatically loved and accepted his now they fought like cats and dogs later but the fact is we love our family it's just built into us and the bible says we don't need to be", "taught how to love each other god does that inside of us but the problem is your love can grow cold toward one another so put fix if you need to the faulty connection that god started when you got saved put in the word faulty by the way do you love of other christians is one of the evidences that you're born again read first john it's one of the the proofs of life spiritually that you're really a christian is you love the brethren and not just in word and um two things and there are many that we could talk about i think hurt our love that we at one time had or keep it from developing one is just distance from one another especially in a bigger church like this is how can we really love each other if we don't really go beyond a church service now church service is a time of worship and it's a time of and it's worse great for that and it's a time of feeding the word you might say but can you imagine how close would you with your family if all you ever did is only eat one meal once a week with them how much time would you have if it was all about the meal and not about what's in the meantime true story a pastor noticed that a man had stopped coming to church he had been coming for years then he stopped coming and after a few weeks the pastor made an appointment with him to come over to his and so he welcomed him into his home it was at night cold night and the man had a big fire going on the fireplace so the pastor sat down in the living room next to the fire made some small talk with the guy and they just kind of sat there together now the man knew he was coming over because he hadn't been in church but the pastor never brought that up at all but at one point the pastor got up went over to the fire took out the you know the tongs the fire tool went into the fire and grabbed an ember that was on fire and he took it out on the hearth and he just put it down it was still burning and he sat down and didn't say anything it was kind of odd and uh the fire eventually kind of fizzled out and just was cold it was dead and then it was time for the pastor to get up and leave he said i'm going to leave", "but i need to do something firstly grab that same ember put it back in the fire where it immediately caught back on fire and as he's walking toward the door the and by the way thank you for the fiery sermon i'll be in church next sunday it's called the silent sermon in other words it says it all do you know that god has not designed us to be healthy spiritually alone god listen to me now god mediates if you will provides a channel for the fullness of his presence the fullness of his power and the fullness of his purpose through his people let me say that again god mediates or provides the fullness of his presence his power and his purpose for you as a believer through his people he didn't have to do that he chose to do that how do i know well he's inside you if you're a christian he'll never leave you nor but where two or more are gathered in my there am i in their midst there's something beyond that that happens with what about his power do you know that the early church laid hands for the receiving of the holy spirit it's one of the foundational doctrines that every christian should know according to hebrews 6 the laying on of simon the sorcerer wanted to buy the right to do it peter and john had to go up to samaria to lay hands on them you have to have a connection with my people to receive the power of my spirit that's the way god has designed it to be you don't just get it on your own it's all up to you it doesn't work that way and the fullness of god's purpose we are the body of christ you are considered a member i don't know if you're an eye or a hand or an ear i don't know what you are i know some of us feel like i'm not really sure that i have any purpose and we kind of can get kind of eeyore about that i don't know my gifts i think i'm just the appendix of the body of a little use and soon to be removed now you have a purpose we need you we don't might not know what your particular but your purpose because you're part of the body of christ the fullness of your purpose will never be discovered on your own it can't be any more than a member of your body could be removed from your body and have any value it's healthy it stays alive it gets healed", "right in connection with the body of christ and so we need to see our is so key do not allow yourself to get distant or stay distant maybe you've always been dis you come you go and you and i just don't you know why i'm not doing too well with the lord well god has more for you in with his people in fact not only from one another but sin can affect us here's what it says in hebrews 3 13 encourage one another the word is parakaleo it means come alongside and like the holy spirit does bless and encourage each other encourage one another day after day as long as it is still called today lest any one of you be hardened by the of sin separation from each other will make our love grow cold but so will just personal sin in our life the fact is when we're in sin we don't like being around people who are walking with the lord because we get to we we don't want to tell them what's going on we don't feel close to god here's what god said in the old he said is my ear dull no it's not i can hear your prayers my arm is not short that it can't save you but your sin has made a separation between you and sin separates us from god god is love right first john 4 8 god is love my sin separates me from the god who is i don't have the ability to give what i i only love because he first loved me i have to stay in right relationship with to be a a reservoir for somebody else so my sin cuts me off from being a of god's love so being separated from each other and sin in our own lives jesus put it this way in matthew 24 during the tribulation which is coming he said because iniquity sin lawlessness is increased the love of many will grow cold that's what sin does it separates us from the very source of love in our own lives we've to do life together too often in a church culture it's like well that means go to church and man let's go on wednesday night it's a big step of faith we're thrilled for you to do that but i got to tell you god's called us to a whole lot more now i have a confession to make i am the one heard somewhere years ago and started repeating this joke about us being i'm repenting today because i think it's funny ha ha we do", "so much with food can i tell you why we do so much with it's not because we're gluttons for god it's because it's biblical and it's family listen when you want to hang out with somebody get to know them better you typically say come over let's have a meal today let's go out to eat you want to spend that why because you like eating and you want to be with people you like when you're eating if you're with somebody and they want to talk to you and you don't want to get close to him you don't invite him to he said i'll talk to you by email zoom i can turn you off you know it's and by the way it's biblical acts 2 jotted down verse 46. listen to the early church spirit-filled here's what and day by day continuing with one mind in the temple and breaking bread from house to house well they were taking their meals together with gladness and sincerity of you see the early church spend time and eating with each other because that's what people who love each other do that's what family does some of you have lunch plans right after this with because it's what families do jesus told the parable he said if a shepherd has a hundred sheep you know the story and one goes doesn't even tell us how i don't know if it's sick got lost we doesn't really matter god's abducted we don't know you're just a sheep missing will he not leave the 99 and search and go find the one that's missing that's what the good shepherd does but can i tell you something that's like well i hope those pastors are doing that no no no you understand every one of us in this room is called of the heart of the shepherd toward the sheep every one of us do you remember the two questions in the book of genesis that god asked he first adam and eve who are hiding from where are you and he wasn't doing that because you go i just can't find him gabriel could you go look over there i he knew exactly where they were because of sin they were separating themselves from god's presence but he doesn't just say oh i know where you are punks you just ruined everything no he says literally in the hebrew it's not are you it's man because adam is ma and he's talking to man and woman man not like man where are you not like that it's an expression of love it was a spurgeon who told his students who were", "going into the ministry when you get to that verse if you read that verse like a cop adam where are you he said quit the ministry you know you don't you don't belong there he said you need to read that verse like a calling out to his children who have just walked into the worst thing that could ever happen to them and are lost in it where are you that question that god asks that's the question we should be asking one another when we don't see each other where are you not like you ought to be we're taking attendance where are you i the second question was what god asked cain in chapter 4 where's your brother remember that one he knew exactly where his brother was you i just buried him by my brother's by the way the answer to that is yes where's your brother where's your sister that used to sit next to you are they at home because of covid are they watching online do you know do you it's too easy to just care about our closest to friends and to not care about those that are hurting maybe waiting for us to reach both questions love the saints continually and then you're going to see step of loving the believers goes a little bit further out put this down and caringly because in verse 2 do not neglect which means it's our tendency to to show hospitality now let me just say hospitality is a word that we tend to think that's like inviting them over for coffee and i have the gift of hospitality it could but that word hospitality is a much bigger word than inviting someone over for tea and it's in greek it's two words it's the philos and semas which speaks of a foreigner the love of foreigners the love of visitors the love of strangers basically the people you don't know but it's still talking about the body of christ to love those who you don't have any relationship with now it's one thing to love people we know and to learn to love them the way god loves us which we'll talk about in a few not just to care about them and value them but to actually meet their needs it's another thing to love strangers in fact you know i was a cop i used to go schools and talk to the kids stranger danger we had a whole program you know just stay away from straight that's fine for children it's not fine for children of god but it is our nature to hang out", "we feel are safe and i know we've just come out of coven where we don't trust anybody and i'm the only one in most stores with no mask i get it okay i understand it but people are still but we're talking here about the way we treat people that we come into contact in the context of the body of christ put this down see visitors as your not your duty your opportunity not your duty the bible says in romans 12 13 we practice love of strangers practice and the word in greek is the word to run after it to pursue it remember when jesus said if you greet those who greet you what's the big deal everybody does that i mean non-christians greet those that greet you they greet their friends but but you are to be different you're to take the initiative to care about you don't know you know one of the places becky and i like to go is down to laguna beach it's beautiful and there's a hotel down there we'd like to we would never stay there it's way too much money but they allow people to walk around their lobby and there's a park you can get to a public park if you go through their their hotel so we'll often go down there's a beautiful view of the ocean and then we'll we'll walk down to the park free and uh we just you know but there's a lot of guests that are staying there and they have a lot more money than we do which is fine they're enjoying themselves at this beautiful grounds so uh but but there's something about the management of this hotel i know nothing about it i don't know who what their program is but there's something going on in training there and i'll tell you why because you cannot walk around by the way the california uh grand california same way you cannot walk around those grounds without an who you walk by total stranger stopping what they're doing if they see you standing up and greeting you politely hello not like they're with their job or something i mean they are genuine incredible you know the bible says we as believers are to out do one another in showing honor but i don't like it when the world is out doing the church and showing honor to total strangers and i know they've been trained to do so but the bible says this is god's heart for us that we are to care for people we don't no now it's not so much that we're all selfish", "us are selfish but most of it is being it's an interesting word when it says don't neglect the greek word they're used to neglect is used to speak of forgetting and there's a gospel passage where jesus after he goes across the sea of galilee with his disciples makes the statement beware of the leaven of the pharisees he's using the metaphor of corrupt leaven to talk about the character of the pharisees but i guess some of the disciples were in the back of the boat they didn't quite hear them because somehow they turned that into oh he said that because we forgot to bring oh who forgot the bread and they're all into this discussion about bread because i'm not talking about bread i'm talking about the pharisees but the word that the disciples use to it's just that we were excited about being with jesus on the boat we we did we just kind of overlooked it and that's exactly what happens with visitors it's not that we're trying to be mean we kind of forgot what it was like to be do you remember the first time you came to this church or the first time you started a new job or you moved into a new neighborhood or you started school and you felt a little apprehensive if you were all alone everybody knew everybody they're all talking and here you are like don't bother me i'm just gonna leave uh when when my son valor started he's my middle kindergarten i'll never forget we took him down he was so excited his older brother was already going to you know first grade now and he was in kindergarten and we took him down with all the other parents we walk our little valerians five years old all right six we walk them in and then there was this point in time where the teacher came out and said okay bring the kids in and so of course we start walking oh not you parents you stay outside it's like oh okay and so the kids all walk in she has them sit down we're watching and i look in and i see my son's eyes get about this big i think he thought mom and dad are going to kindergarten you know starting today we're going to hang out with him and he wasn't expecting us to have to drop him off with total strangers and he's sitting on the ground he keeps like come sit here now and it was like i mean i felt it was child abuse to not obey my five-year-old at that point and", "the teacher goes back goodbye parents go by go by they needed us to leave but there is this feeling and maybe we disguise it better as we get older but of being very alone even in the midst of a crowd and i have no doubt there's somebody today it's your first time maybe you're on time and you're just feeling like i'm just visiting i'm you know i don't need anybody to say hello to me the job of meeting people caring about and loving them is not the job of the greeters at the door um they cannot do what you can do in fact in some ways while they will greet people who come in anybody who's greeted by a greeter knows that's your job good job but you see you can do it and it's not but the lord is saying make those people the difference that some i've heard testimonies of people at this church who have talked about why they came back the way they were treated in the parking lot they were treated by one of the pastors or pastors wives or just a person who just loved them and showed them around you want to know where the bathrooms are you probably need to know or the cafe or can i show you where the children's how by the way we have services sharing about what's going on just loving them just caring about them it's not that complex but we tend to forget that that was us at one time and here it says something very he says don't neglect to show hospitality to strangers look at what he goes on to say for by this by hospitality some have entertained angels without knowing it now that's kind of a cryptic statement there's some people that go like what there's some people like every time there's a hitchhiker i'm picking them up might be one looking for the angels you know got another wing you know i would not recommend you pick up every stranger uh that's not what this passage is saying that's how to obey no listen to me this is a reference very likely to genesis 18 the first five verses which we'll read together so we the background genesis 18 beginning in verse 1. do we have that on the screens there it is now the lord appeared to abram by the oaks of memory while he was sitting at the tent door so abram's just in the heat of the day and when he abram lifted up his eyes he looked and behold he doesn't know that they're two angels", "in the lord he has no idea but they were standing opposite him right outside this house and when he saw them notice what he did he ran from the tent door to meet them not interesting he bowed himself to the earth and he said my lord and he doesn't mean my lord god that's why it's lower case he just means sir if i have found favor in your sight if you'll do me a favor please do not pass by your servant let water be brought and wash your feet rest yourself under the tree i'll bring a piece of bread that you may refresh yourselves and after that you may go on since you have your servant and they said go do as you have said it's a fascinating passage he finds out later we find out later this was the lord himself and two angels the angels are going to go down to sodom and gomorrah give a report and bring judgment on sodom and gomorrah the idea is that you're probably going to be an angel if you pick up a stranger that's not the idea here the idea is you have no idea who you're ministering to jesus said in matthew 25 to the sheep i was a and you invited me in you didn't realize but when you did it under the least of these my brethren you did it to me in other words every chance that we get to minister to a stranger a visitor is an opportunity to minister to the jot down exodus 23 and verse 9 exodus 23 verse 9 you shall not oppress a stranger since you yourself know the feelings of a stranger for you also in the land of egypt when we are kind and accepting and welcoming of strangers we're actually starting to love the way god has already you go well i've been an american my whole i've been coming to this church my whole life yeah but you weren't always presence you were a stranger and now you're not jot it down in ephesians 2 verses 12 and 13 remember that you talking to gentiles were at that time separate from christ excluded from the commonwealth of israel and you were strangers to the covenants of promise having absolutely no hope and without god in the world but now in christ you who are formerly far have been brought near by the blood of christ in other words it's the way god has already loved us i think of the case of paul we know that paul got saved his name was saul on the road to damascus he meets jesus", "has an incredible revelation he's but how does paul ever get accepted by the church because all the church knew is he was basically a terrorist and they didn't trust him not only did ananias need the lord's assurance to even go pray for him how does paul become affiliated with church leadership in jerusalem well there's an individual do you remember what his name is barnabas paul is trying to go hang out with peter james and john and the well peter and john anyway by this time and just connect with the leadership of the church the apostles and he had a radical calling from jesus christ a radical conversion they did not trust him but one guy and by the way barnabas that's not his real name that's his christian nickname barnabas hebrew the arabic translated son of encouragement he had the gift of and so he sees this guy who's been converted and he sees the church leaders afraid of him and you know what he does he takes paul by the hand if you will and he brings them to introduce he's this bridge between paul's old life and his new life in the church and he introduces them to the apostles and he says hey the lord appeared to him on the road just changed his life can i tell you something the church today needs more barnabases and some barnabettis we need those that are gifted and called in this but all of us are called to the same role of loving strangers we'll put this down letter c put in the word suffering serve the first love one another keep loving each other secondly don't forget about the new people and then number the prisoners as though you were in prison with them and those who are ill-treated since you yourselves are also in the body of christ remember when went into the synagogue opened up the scroll of isaiah it was the reading for the day and he reads from isaiah 61 and he says this is going to be fulfilled today and you're the spirit of the lord has anointed me to preach the gospel to preach the good news and he describes what the good news is and part of the good news is to deliver the captives i have now we know there's a spiritual description of a person who's in bondage to sin who's getting set free by the but it's very interesting because in matthew 25 besides saying i was a stranger and you invited me and he also said i was a prisoner and you came to me that is something that the sheep that", "are going to heaven do put this down remember those who are persecuted for their faith and that's hard living in a country while things are getting worse they're still not to where we're seeing christians arrested and put into prison here yet but they are all over the world 348 million christians live in countries that persecute christians one in eight christians in the world today are though we aren't too familiar with it jot down colossians 4 and verse 18 i paul write this greeting with my own my imprisonment paul was in prison and he wanted christians to remember him jot down hebrews 10 verses 32-34 earlier in this book the writer says but recall the former days in which after you were illuminated you got saved you endured a great struggle with suffering partly while you were made a spectacle both by reproaches and tribulations partly while you became companions of those who were so treated for you had compassion on me in my and you joyfully accepted the plundering of your goods knowing that you have a better and enduring possession for yourselves in heaven it may surprise you but they on this this is called the world 2021 world watch list that open doors puts out every day 13 christians worldwide are killed because of their faith every day every day 12 churches or christian buildings are attacked and every day 12 christians are unjustly or imprisoned and another five are abducted so as we speak right here today in the safety of what we enjoy there are christians who don't have that have never had that and may never have that on friday i spent some time in saudi arabia by prayer praying for a man named adam who is facing 30 years for his faith oh he's there's some trumped-up charges he's led some people to christ gotten some other christians out of the country because they're being persecuted now he's being accused falsely he needs to pray for him by the way there's a great ministry if you've not heard of it called open doors how many of you ever heard of open doors okay open doors they exist to help christians fulfill the verse that we're in because our tendency is to say well i don't know anybody in prison for their faith so i guess i don't have any responsibility even though there are lots of them who need our support very cool open doors website go there you can write to adam like i did a brief word of encouragement that will be delivered to him in prison two or three sentences say i'm praying", "for you i heard about you be strong encourage them in the lord what a blessing that an organization is all about helping people like us minister to people that are suffering by the way let me go further there's an app that open doors has and in this app they'll tell you about an area of the world where christians are suffering from their faith where you can just briefly read about it and pray and mark that i'm praying for and they change it every week i think praying for the christians over in mali east mali right now because of their they don't have the word of god and they're persecuted so they're using audio bibles it's an in fact what i found out is i posted some of this on my facebook page there's somebody who goes to our church who works for open doors i have no idea he private messaged me and said bob we love this ministry thank you for sharing about i said i love what you're doing keep it up we need you and he said well he works in the technology department and he said what we're working on for next year is awesome i'm so excited about it we hope to be by next year connecting christians from america in real time with video chatting those christians that are being persecuted so you can talk directly to them pray for that you guys we want to minister you can't fly there you can't drive there but god is going to use technology to help us to in a very real way now paul the apostle writes to timothy in and he speaks of those who have been taken captive by the devil to do his uses the same word of being imprisoned so when we read in the passage of scripture we're to remember the prisoners as though in prison with them we need to be realistic and and realize there are people in prison who are christians who are there because of their faith and we need to make sure they know that they're not there are other christians in jail and in prison who are there because they were not living by faith okay they need to know that they can be we need to express the grace of god to them still there are others in prison who don't know the lord at all who will come to faith because christians are involved in jail ministries and prison you know chuck colson who was part of the watergate scandal thank god till the day that he died and went to heaven", "that he got arrested he said i would have never been a christian had i not i got saved and he started the prison onesimus was saved because paul was in prison the bible says and so there are people that are waiting to hear the gospel you talk about a captive audience you got a captive audience when you get to go minister in the jails and so that's part of this as well there christians who are in bondage in prison not in a physical jail but there are some that are in prison today they look like everyone else they're just walking around free but they're not free at all you see they're captive to sin they're captive to deception and depression and to fear and to guilt and to shame there's all kinds of even in the body of christ where people are living out their lives as christians but they feel locked up and god has given you and me of the grace of god in the gospel for the unsaved but the ministry of truth jesus said you'll know the truth and the truth will do what click click we are to bear one another's burdens and fulfill the law of christ but we're to minister to other christians now i want to just say a word to you about how to do this but put this down first of all help the hurting practically we're talking about loving each other today and here's the thing with love we in our culture are brought up with a very romanticized version of love that's all about feeling so people say well i'm getting a divorce why i just don't love anymore i fell out of love well whenever you just that's what love is to you something you fall into i had no control it's like a big ditch i just fell in and i fell out again uh you're gonna have a problem there is still even though we know that word doesn't mean that in the bible to love each other just means to feel love toward each other we still kind of get we trouble we trouble with that one or in trouble i should say let me give you an example jesus goes to lazarus's and he weeps the response of the crowd it's very similar to today they see him weeping what do they say behold how he loved him he's crying deeply he's deeply affected by the loss now we can relate to that it it it mattered to you that he died he's you're not just attending the funeral because you were invited", "you know okay a little late but you're here oh no you are personally really affected by his loss so we get that that's what we think love is is feeling and that's it but i gotta tell you something love is not an emotion listen to me it is an action verb for god so loved he what he gave he did something romans 5 8 but god demonstrates his own love toward us and that while we're here at died for us it's an action verb if there's no action it's not biblical love in fact jot it down first john 3 verses 16 through 18. listen to this we love agape by this that he laid down his life for us and we ought to lay down our lives for the brethren but whoever has this world's goods and beholds his brother in need and closes his heart against him how does the love of god abide in him little children let us not love with word or tongue but in deed and when we are thinking about those people that are hurting we have to go beyond just remembering them there are people hurting we need to ask the question lord is there anything i can do to help them and the thing that will help us to do that is to ask a very simple question that jesus outlined in the gospel of luke you know this one luke 6 31 may not know the reference but you know this rule luke 6 31 says this whatever you would want done for you do for others do unto others it's the golden rule right and just as you want people to treat you treat them in the same way so here's what you do you hear about somebody in jail you hear about somebody who's lost a spouse or a loved one somebody just lost their job just put yourself in their sandals and say if that were me what would i want people to do would i want them to ignore me and just tell me a year later i was praying for you i heard about it or what i want them to reach out to me and say i care i love you can i help you can i walk through this with you you cannot minister love if you don't know what's going on in each other's lives not possible you have to know about the need and then you have to minister to it you say well i don't know what to say when somebody's going through a really hard time i mean they're it's scary i know", "by the way the good news is a lot of times you know what you need to say with to somebody who's going through a tragedy absolutely nothing see i thought you just said you got a minister to you do the book of job is a long book you know what most of the book of job is the friends of job giving him advice beautiful flowery words about how great god is and how he must have sinned otherwise god wouldn't have done this in his life so stop pretending you're right just because you're not job you did something admit it god's holy god's just but you're getting what you deserve and god's punishing you because you're but if you read the beginning of the book of job you know that that's not the but i just want to remind you just real brief version of the book of job here at first his friends actually didn't have any advice for him they heard that he had lost his wealth his children all in a day and everything even his own health he lost everything that he had and the bible says they made an appointment to come together they came a great distance to where he and when they saw him they sat down on the ground with him they wept with him and they said nothing because they saw his grief was if the book had just ended right there it'd be like if you want to know how to minister to people that are suffering go do what his friends did but they opened their mouths and they ruined it miserable comforters are you all job said not when they just loved him enough to come and cry and sit and hurt it's actually really easy to minister to people that are hurting you don't have anything you just have to show up and say you matter to me and i can only you know what is that song i can only imagine right it's a great song about heaven i don't really know what it's going to be like i can only imagine well i dare i but guess what you are to imagine what people are to go through are going through say what would that be like if that was me i could man i can imagine that would be horrible and i can imagine how i'd want say i love you i i miss you i'm hurting for you i want them to tell me i wanted to come tell me that to go tell them that whatever you would do or want people to do", "for you do that for them so this area of ministering to people that are hurting practically christians has changed my life uh historically as a church in 1990 i know that's a long time ago i was a police officer i just finished being a cop i was still a reserve actually for and i heard about a ministry that was ministering to christians who are being persecuted and oppressed in communist countries particularly at that time in the soviet union in north korea and in cuba communist cuba and so they were sharing this is a ministry from pastor chuck's church brother dan wooding was coming around sharing with us about this need for christian churches in america to connect and partner with sister churches in communist country because there are believers there behind the iron current literally who are extremely isolated extremely alone they're poor already and now they're oppressed by the government because they're christians so they some are being arrested some can't get jobs there don't have enough food i mean they're really suffering and they said you know we really don't expect you as a church to to go there ever in fact it's illegal to to go there but you can pray for them this is before the internet so we couldn't they didn't have phones so all we could do is write them letters and take pictures of ourselves and say please send us pictures of the people in your church and so they did they send us pictures we had a church a sister church we still have it sister there in havana called the church of god of jesus christ it's a pentecostal church in downtown havana little church it seems like a church could only fit about 20 people in their room they have about 150 people to come they don't all fit in the room they a lot of them stand on the street and they have a sound system for 20 people they blast up the music like ridiculously loud so it could just go out on the streets and down the streets because the government can't tell them to turn it down so they can preach the gospel all over the neighborhood without ever actually saying it i think it's illegal to preach publicly so anyway we we go there and we meet the pastor and his we have a great time we deliver food and some a little bit of money and some medicine and some children's bibles and some study materials for the past we just have a great time knowing we'll probably never come back and we had been informed", "by the ministry do not preach the gospel publicly in cuba you can be arrested and you'll destroy our ministry there if it becomes known that we're sending christians from america so do not share the gospel with anybody just go and food and the money and then leave so it was our last night and we had a church service and their church services sometimes last three and they're just getting started anyway it was time you know it's all in spanish and i'm going yeah i know nothing here i can see you guys love jesus that's for sure but we we're leaving we get on the wawa the wawa is the name at that time for their bus system these big buses and so we're taking the bus they don't have cars we're taking a bus back to our hotel where we're going to leave the next morning back for the united states and it's about midnight and we're on the bus and we've been told don't talk to people on the streets and definitely do not exchange money pesos for dollars everybody wants dollars there hard currency they don't like their pesos but do not exchange pesos it's against the law and don't share the gospel with anybody okay so we're on our way back to the hotel and there's these two guys on the bus and they're cuban and uh they start one of them speaks english a little bit of english most people didn't speak any english but this one guy starts speaking english to us and he starts engaging me and so he said hey do you guys uh have i go i'm all out uh and i said we don't smoke he said oh he goes well uh would you like to exchange some you know you have dollars because i have pesos i'd like to change it's a year in prison for every dollar that he would have if he got arrested if i give him 10 bucks and he got stopped 10 years in prison that's how serious they were about this i said yeah we can't do that and so he's just engaging me in conversation i'm trying to ignore him actually you know it's a late night midnight we get off the bus we got about a mile walk or so to our hotel and these two guys get off the bus too and one of them is a very big guy i mean like big like football nfl sized guy and he's walking behind the other guy and i'm thinking okay what is this your stop anyway so we're walking and so they they", "keep engaging us in conversation and the guy speaks a little english he's a talker you know and so how do you like havama and i didn't know how to answer that politely havana looks like it needs about a zillion gallons of paint applied to the buildings that are just not painted so i said well it's very interesting and then he said well what do you think and i could tell he was proud of me he said what do you think of fidel castro who was in power at the time i said what do you think about him he said i think he's a very great man i he said you guys are from america aren't you i go yeah he goes i would never want to live in your country i said oh and he started to tell me all the things that he had been told about which were completely not true but he had been indoctrinated there and i just tried to help him set some of that straight i wasn't defending the united states i just told him that's not actually true or that's not true and then some prostitutes walked by said so what do you think of the girls here and i said well we're not we're not here for that he goes what are you here for i thought okay okay do not share the in public make disciples of all the nations i'm thinking well i kind of have a higher authority to answer to here but don't want to ruin their ministry so i said well i said we're christians those christians i've heard of you because you guys had something with the churches and the cry there's catholic church been there forever but he had never been to church he didn't really know what we believed he's dad's a communist but he wanted to know more and he wanted to practice english and so he said well why why are you guys here and i thought oh okay i know we're leaving it first thing in the morning i know they don't have a car i know he doesn't live because i asked him he lived an hour away and i said listen i said i would love to tell you why we're here and what it means to be a christian i said i'll tell you what you come to my hotel told him where we were staying i said you come tomorrow morning at eight o'clock or seven early and i knew he wouldn't come and uh but i wanted to know if if he was serious he could", "i don't know how and uh he said okay okay i'll come i thought sure so we took off spent the night we're leaving like at nine the next morning for the for the airport and uh the bus is coming for us sure enough bright and early dressed up nicely him and his friend show up you know his friend speaks no english at all but big still big anyway they show up and so they sit down with me for an hour in fact we couldn't even sit in the lobby it was against the hotel's rules to allow a cuban man to sit in a lobby of a cuban hotel that's only for visitors for people with money and so we had to go outside and i simply started sharing the gospel what it meant to know jesus christ what he had done in my life and uh he just they they were you know it all had to be translated for the friend who didn't understand any english so we would say a little bit he would translate it and no they were just listening hanging on for about an hour and i knew the bus was coming and i just said i i said he died for you he loves you i said i think part of the reason we're here is for you and i told him about our ministry but i said can i pray with you and so they gave their lives to christ that morning i gave them a bible they they said you know we'd like to see you again i thought i don't know that we're ever coming so we jumped on the bus and they were waving the buy somehow they got another bus showed up at the airport they're waving to us again i'm not kidding i got a letter a few months later and i wasn't sure if they really understood and he was talking about you know how i want to live for the commander-in-chief and i thought i was talking about fidel and then i read more he was talking about jesus and he was saying please come back we want to be baptized anyway the rest of the story is incredible i can't tell at all right now about what god did in his family as a result of all this but we did make subsequent trips and we did baptize them well i tell you that to tell you this oh by the way both of them not only got uh richard the one the young man the he was 16 at the time", "he he gave his life to christ and he was so impacted by the gospel he just wanted with his life to serve the lord he is he became the first pastor of a calvary chapel in cuba there in havana he's been a pastor now for we now have two sister churches so we're by the way he'll be here i hope to introduce him to you in july for those of you that did meet him the other guy the big guy he attends this church i just hugged him uh between services because he married one of our gals that used to go on our over there as a missionary they met each other talking about missionary dating they they got married they have a family here they live in anaheim and they both love the lord but i share that with you it's a god story but it's because of this it all started with trying to honor god with what he says in the word lord you told us we got to care about christians we don't know in other places that are suffering i don't even know how to know them but there was a ministry to help us that's kind of what open doors is doing right now it's connecting christians with christians and say obey this command it's still in our and there are prisoners that are isolated and alone and they're waiting to care to pray and to say you know what i might not be able to go there but i'm praying every day that god will help you in your situation to overcome to have victory to be a strong and bold witness and if possible to be released i want to close but before i do i want to do something i've never done with you i'm not going to have you come forward but i am going to ask all of you to i want you to stand um you know when i became a policeman in two different departments the day it was actually official i went into the chief's office and i had to get sworn in you have to get sworn in so you raise your right hand and he has me recite some things about committed committing myself to obey and uphold the laws of the state of california and the constitution the and then he swears me in as a police there's something uh that you learn about in law enforcement called posse by the way this is different than the posse comitatus act that you might hear about in the news possibilities comes from the ninth", "century in england where a sheriff had to say to citizens i deputize you you're now part of the law enforcement you're going to help me defend our county and that's what it means and still on the books that the law enforcement can say to somebody who's not a cop you're a cop right now to come help me i order you and you're under law uh required to do so i want to ask you if you're a christian and you're willing to take these three commands that we just studied to love each other with the love of god practically more than we already are to love strangers that come among us because folks there are tons of new people coming some because their churches weren't open during covet and so they came our way i don't know if they're going back maybe they are maybe they're not doesn't matter to me we have an opportunity to love some brothers and sisters and then there are new people that are coming all the time come some coming from covid there's a huge need right now one another and we can't do it a handful of pastors could never do that alone and then there are those beyond us that are hurting that are in bondage so if you are a believer and you're willing to do more than learn this passage you're saying i want to live this passage i want you to raise your and repeat after me i promise to love to enfold the strangers and to serve the with the compassions of christ with the power of the holy spirit for the glory of god so help me god god bless you for that let's sing if you want to love a homeless person or help us to do so and you can go buy a shirt it's the simplest easiest thing you could do to say i care about that maybe you won't be here on thanksgiving but you're saying i want my church to minister to him and maybe you're here and you have big plans for thanksgiving and maybe just maybe the lord's gonna say this year i have big plans for your thanksgiving you're going to by giving yourself i can't tell you that there's ever been a greater day that i can remember for this church than two years ago on thanksgiving when 800 an army of people said i'll eat i i'll be with my family later i want to be with the family of god today and with them i want to love this community we know our efforts are not going to end", "homelessness jesus said the poor you always have with you but this opportunity that we have the bible says he who gives to the poor lends to the lord and god will repay don't miss the blessing join us for that tonight to sunday night somebody that you're praying for somebody who doesn't know the lord somebody that's far from god let's come together be the body of christ to be the church god has great things in store for us if we'll just obey his commands now may the lord bless you and keep you may he make his face to shine upon you and be gracious on you may he lift up his countenance upon you and give you his peace in the name of the father and the son and the holy ghost god bless", "creature will make the matter known well let's pray father thank you that there is wisdom for every person in this room every person listening Lord there are answers to questions we have there are reproofs for wrong ways of thinking Lord there's a need for us to repent of some things and a need for us for us to be encouraged in some things tonight and your word is able to identify those things perfectly so Lord You're Perfect your word is perfect and we're sure not but we come to look into the light of the mirror of your word and see the areas that you want to correct inspect and kind of encourage us and all at the same time so be free Lord as the great physici to do a whole body scan tonight in Jesus name amen all all right you can seated Charles H Spurgeon said the doorstep to the Temple of wisdom is the knowledge of our own ignorance I like that in other words the first place you want to start at becoming wise is to admit you need it you need to understand things you don't understand if you want to grow tonight then come tonight with that sense of God I believe there's things I need to know better not like you know I'm not sure there's much this guy or the Bible's going to teach me I've read this book forget it you're wasting your time go home now yeah really in and outs across street just come with an attitude that says God I do need to learn I do need to grow I'm making mistakes that I don't even know half of the mistakes I'm probably making so I want to come with that humble heart the doorstep to the Temple of wisdom is the knowledge of our own ignorance well we're going to C uh about three different areas tonight the first one letter a is is to be wise with your words we talk a lot about what we say in the Book of Ecclesiastes and Proverbs um and why let me just ask you why are words your words so important to God why why does it matter I mean look a lot of things are said we make promises we make commitments we're in the mood to say something sometimes for why does God say words are really important just raise your hand if you want to answer that what why do you think words your words you speak are that important yeah okay so life and death is in the power of the tongue sounds like something someone said in the New", "Testament James said that yeah show your character words show your character okay somebody else why are words so important you can yeah way back in the back yeah we're going to give an answer we're going to have to be accountable for every every word somebody else same thing yeah okay words have power to lift each other up anybody else why are why take the time yeah okay that's a good point your words are actually um a a verbal audible reflection of what you can't see um we've called it the dipstick to the soul you you you how do you know what's going on inside someone's life but the Bible says out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaks uh Richard okay chose who's in control of you what what you can Jesus uh spoke about false prophets and he said you'll know them by their fruit James says one tree uh or one Fountain doesn't Produce Salt Water uh and fresh water so and uh you know a certain plant will produce one particular kind of fruit not two so we should know uh and people can tell about us what's inside of us same idea by what's going on through our mouth so our words are very important let's jot down the first passage then James 3 18 who among you is wise and understanding let him show by his good behavior his deeds in the gentleness of wisdom but if you have bitter jealousy and selfish ambition in your heart hey don't be arrogant and so lie against the truth this wisdom is not that which comes down from above it's Earthly natural and demonic for where jealousy and selfish ambition exist there is disorder and every evil thing but the wisdom from above is first pure then Peaceable it's gentle it's reasonable full of mercy and good fruits unwavering hypocrisy so uh our first verse tonight is verse 11 it says if the serpent bites before being Charmed there is no profit for the charmer put this down remember there is the wise and there is the other wise that's what James has just told us there's a Earthly wisdom that man uses but it's demonic devilish and natural and then there is now they had snake Charmers I guess they still exist but if the Snake Charmer goes to charm a snake and kind of performance but he gets bit before he charms it he's not getting paid that's really what this verse says it's pretty straightforward if the serpent bites before being Charmed charmer doesn't get any benefit it's too late um the King", "James version though I like it what it says it's a little different it says surely the serpent will bite without enchantment and then it adds this and a babbler is no better now that's the idea in context of what's uh being talked about and I don't really doubt that Solomon got this analogy from listening to his dad because David wrote this put it down Psalm 58: 3-5 the wicked are estranged from the womb those who speak lies go astray from birth they have venom like the Venom of a serpent like a deaf Cobra that stops up its ear so that it does not hear the voice of Charmers or a skillful Caster of spells so David Solomon's father already made this analogy ology that the wicked are not only bent that way from birth actually we all are but he describes them as being like a poisonous snake that can't be Charmed and winds up being dangerous and of course David had his fair share of people who actually uh betrayed him including adonijah and absum and some terrible things happened so the idea is beware of babblers because if they're not stopped they'll bite you put this down number two the words of the wise are kind in the word kind the words of the wise are kind gracious and 12 words from the mouth of a wise man are gracious while the lips of a fool consume him I've said it before you've heard it said before me you never had to apologize for what you said right never have to to apologize for what you didn't say God's words and the words of a gracious man or a wise man I should say are gracious Zechariah 1:13 describes what the angel said when after the 70 years of captivity the question was is Jerusalem just going to continue to experience the wrath of God and uh one Angel asked the angel of the Lord this and the the Lord answered the angel who was speaking with me Zechariah says with gracious words with comforting words and then Luke 4:22 I just love this verse I mentioned it the other day think about Jesus I I think of this verse and all were speaking well of him and they were wondering at the gracious Words which were I like the fact that it says falling from his lips you almost can picture a tree with fruit that's so ripe it just it's just falling off you know uh you don't have to pick it and grab it and get words out of somebody say thank you oh thank you like", "I really not thankful but I'm saying no no it just came uh which were falling from his lips and they were saying is son uh people use words to get a lot of times to get a job how to use the right words people use words to get a laugh people use words sometimes guys use words to try to get a girl God wants us to use words to give a blessing and as Believers if we're wise one of the characteristics of our words is that we're using words to minister instead of trying to get something and the idea that they're gracious words speaks of those words that aren't really necessarily deserved they don't have to be said it's not like they owe them to you I'll never forget uh one Sunday after I had preached you know as a pastor I love the word of God and I love sharing it's my greatest desire in life to do so but I'm not always confident God is using me and I have to trust him sometimes I not sure of that at all you know I'm human I mean I just glad did somebody come back this week praise the Lord you know and and you know I'm vulnerable to that discouragement and I'll never forget one Sunday I was over at a local restaurant and a guy who's been with us probably since the church started 30 some years ago he he happened to be in the restaurant and he came up to me and this is what he whispered in my ear he said Bob copy like yep that's said I think God smiles when you preach you know what what a blessing what a what a kind word to me to I mean that he feels that way and wanted me to know he didn't have to say that but kind I tell you something that was like cold water uh on parch lips um Wayne Boro who by the way we need to be be praying for uh when's been with us for a number of years he left Calvary coasta Mesa he was with Chuck for years and years and years and he would come up to me he's done it many times he'd say Bob I'd love coming to this church I love hearing you because it's like you're Chuck Smith hair I don't think I sound like Chuck Smith at all but that's you know that that's cool you know I so yeah those are gracious words in my life that other people have given I want to be that way to people it's not about saying", "something something you don't mean or feel it's allowing yourself to be a gift to somebody else encouraging words well they cost you nothing but they can change a life they can actually save a life so a wise person offers up verbal praise and audible thanks to God that's one of the characteristics um words that encourage people rather than criticize them Bible says we speak the truth and love a wise person speaks with gentl not with impatient and Angry Words wise words include things like I'm sorry you know the one that F Fonzi could never say I'm there are some people who have the syndrome sin n can't say that word too prideful or please forgive me kind words would mean to be able to say the words I love you without feeling like it's you know below you to say so like that husband who said well no I don't tell my wife I love her very often but I do but I don't need to say it I told her I loved her with the day I married her if I ever changed my mind I'll tell her well that doesn't that doesn't cut it um and it goes on in the passage to describe the fool look at verse 12 again it says but the lips of a fool whereas the the mouth of the wise are giving Grace to people the lips of a fool wind up consuming him so a fool winds up being his Own Worst Enemy jot down Proverbs 18 and verse 7 a Fool's mouth is his ruin and his lips are the snare of his soul some of you remember the story of that Frog who was trying to figure out how he could get across this large lake and it was just too big of a lake for him to go around he figured he would die so he he went up to a couple of large birds and he said listen I have this idea I'm going to pick up a stick and if each of you would take an end of the stick I'll grab hold of the Middle with my mouth and if you would fly together we could fly right across the lake would you be willing to do that and they said sure So they he picked up this little stick they grabbed each end and sure enough I mean it's an amazing thing this frog was being carried across the lake by these two big birds and somebody was on the side of the lake and said wow that's amazing I I wonder who thought of", "that the frog said I did okay it's a good illustration of how mouth can become your ruin some of you are writing that down to tell others of you going I can't believe he thinks that's funny put it down number three recognize the more you talk the sin yeah put in the word sin and look at 13 the beginning of the Fool's talking is folly just m around but the end of it is wicked Madness jot down Proverbs 10: 21 where there are or when there are many words transgression is unavoidable is a pretty powerful statement you guys where there are many words you're going to sin but he who restrains his lips is wise the tongue of the righteous is as Choice silver in other words it's rare the heart of the wicked is worth little the lips of the righteous feed many gives but a fool dies for lack of understanding so am I a fool or am I wise well I one of the ways I can judge that is by how I'm doing with my mouth here's a statement you've heard uh from the scripture even a fool when he keeps his mouth closed is considered wise think about that you know you can't really tell someone's just sitting there nodding their head wow you know I mean if you couldn't you didn't have a clue what I was talking about tonight you're tired you're bored you're sit going going oh man they're into it but I would have no clue that in reality you're thinking about going to bed or something um and it was Mark Twain some say uh Abraham Lincoln but one of the two said better to remain silent and be thought a fool than to speak and to remove all that's true quite often the wisest thing we can say to someone else is absolutely nothing at all and any of us can do that well maybe not like that guy I heard him he goes I have a friend he speaks seven languages fluently but what impresses me the most about him is he knows how to shut up in so the fool starts out as with uncontrolled speech kind of ranting but he ends up in something that's dangerous uh to others kind of that you know sometimes in our homes in our marriages or with our kids or whatever there's a a freedom which we want to be free to be ourselves but sometimes there's a freedom and we let it all hang loose and we just say everything we feel and think and we are very offensive we can be very", "offensive with you know uh can I tell you something you want to have a a blessed vacation sometime go on a vacation with some other people together you'll find that you are a better person you'll be on guard a little bit and a little bit no you because you want people to think well of you so uh but yeah we need to be careful about uh hurting each other in the home put this down the fool has much to say about nothing look at verse 14 and 15 put in the word nothing yet the fool multiplies words no man knows what will happen in other words in the future and who can tell him what will come after him the toil of a fool so wearies him that he does not even know how to go to a city Matthew Henry great commentator from centuries ago said the fool will have the last word though it be but the same with that with which was the first in other words he repeats himself uh what is wanting in the weight and strength of his words the fool he Endeavors in vain to make up in the number of them and they must be repeated because otherwise there is nothing to them to make them regarded just a lot of talking but not really saying anything you know people talk about people being a blo hard full of hot air U there was a weatherman once who said my wife speaks about 40 miles an hour with gusts up to 70 and uh but you know we don't want to be thought of that way um jot down James 4: 13-16 come now you who say this is exactly that's why um you know Ecclesiastes and Proverbs sometimes James has been called the New Testament Book of Proverbs but like Ecclesiastes here a similar thought in James very practical come now you who say today or tomorrow we will go to such and such a city and spend a year there and engage in business and make a profit yet you do not know what your life will be like tomorrow you're just a vapor that appears for a little while and then vanishes away away instead you ought to say if the Lord Wills we will live and also do this or that but as it is you boast in your arrogance all such boasting is evil now let me ask you something oh you can take it off the screen let me ask you something about what James is saying is it wrong to plan then as a", "Christian okay so what is it the James is pointing out is wrong raise your hand if you can identify the difference okay perfect it's not wrong to plan in fact it's been said if you're failing to plan is planning to fail and the Bible says a lot of good things about planning so we can't kind of the laziness I'm not going to plan go yeah I'm just trusting the Lord and wherever the spirit leads and it's like that's not what the Bible teaches the what God is against God is not against planning god listen to me God is against Godless planning leaving God out I'm going to do this I'm I got my fiveyear plan God has nothing to do with it or just kind of like yeah yeah well I'm a Christian so whatever God wants oh no he doesn't just mean if you go through the motions of saying if the Lord Wills the idea is God everything in my life my very next breath I'm dependent on you so I'm submitting this to you for authorization or Cor Direction you edit my plans Lord but I want to walk dependent on you I'm not going to trust in my own understanding but I am going to plan with your help asking you to direct me and then guide me and of course change the pl so that's the idea but the Fool on the other hand is kind of has a lot to say about uh nothing you know back in 1960 there was a song uh it was called you talk too much have you ever heard that song it said you talk too much you worry me to death you talk too much you even worry my pet you just talk talk talk too much you talk about people you don't know you talk about people wherever you go you just talk talk too much you talk about people that you've never seen you talk about people you could make me scream you just talk talk talk too much and I of course this is the characteristic of the fool they have a lot to say about everything and really about absolutely uh nothing when it comes down to it so someone has written this the fool is so busy talking about the future he loses his way in the present it's describing them it's having a lot to say but they can't even get into the City and even in the ancient world no they didn't have interstates and no they didn't have GPS Navi but the way into the cities were", "obvious and the point is yeah the fool has an opinion you know uh somebody said uh opinions are like armpits everybody has them and most of them stink but um a fool you know I I once heard this that why is it everybody who knows how to run the country is either cutting hair or taxis or maybe Ubers nowaday you know those people that seem to have an opinion about everything it's the way it should be done and there are people like that the Bible says yeah they're fools they're fools as they spout all their and and demonstrate all their uh ignorance uh someone has said this person who acts like they know it all about what's going to happen in the future um is like that proverb I guess it's from the south that says they ain't got the good sense that God gave a goose you know or they're so dumb they couldn't learn the route to run an elevator um or they take three hours to Minutes or they the kind of person who thinks Taco Bell is a phone company in Mexico so you know that's the problem anyway sorry that's what somebody said I didn't say it um be wise with your word secondly or letter B be wise in your work but in the word word work look at 16 woe to you o land whose King is a lad and whose princes feast or party is the idea in the morning blessed are you o land whose King is of nobility and whose princes eat at the right time appropriate time for strength and not drunkenness um so the second Arena of wisdom is first of all wisdom will be displayed or it'll be missing in what we say or what people say the second in is in the area of Industry how we work how we treat work um so put this down fools feed for pleasure the wise feed for strength um is is what it's talking about it says if a king is a lad it's it's talking about somebody who's immature and the whole country being affected by it uh true story uh Charles I 12th of uh he was the king King of Sweden was made King when he was 15 and um very very immature uh one occasion he took his horse through his grandmother's apartment kind of ruining it him and his friends ran the streets knocking people down they would do target practice in the palace and blow out all the windows I mean it was just kind of a big black ey and embarrassment", "to the people of Sweden so all the noted preachers uh of the land decided to preach on this verse on the same Sunday that when a king is a lad and immature it's an embarrassment to the nation so I don't know if that got his attention or not but it's that's a true story um so here we see the king is immature and the kind of people that he's put into office they're partying and they're they're kind of uh feasting in the morning which is not the time for feasting and um so somebody has written this a Statesman asks what's best for my country a politician asks what's best for my party and a mere office holder asks what's safest easiest most profitable uh for me now a noble King in the text is characterized as eating what and when appropriate um eating in other words for the right reason so here's a question we need to always ask ourselves am I a person who lives to eat sometimes we're guilty of that am I living to eat all I can think about is where are we going for lunch where we okay now we're at lunch let's talk about where we're going for dinner and it's sad to say in a luxury-minded culture we do a lot of that do I live to eat or do I eat to uh if you want to be healthy not only do we know we need to eat at the appropriate time and the appropriate amount but it's also true in the spiritual realm am I I taking the word of God in at the appropriate time am I disciplining myself for the purpose of godliness and so we see the fool feeds their flesh for pleasure the wise feeds their body for strength put this down number two a house without upkeep is obvious without and within Verse 18 through indolence or laziness the rafters sag and through slackness the the idea is the fool is so busy with enjoyment they don't have any energy for employment their homes um need repair you know all of our homes need repair um it's a great joy when you buy your first house right until you own it still a joy I mean financially it's a good deal but a lot more work because you can't call up the landlord and say hey there's a scratch in my screen door could you please repl it you know can't do that anymore um now it's you call yourself hello me uh would you please wash the dishes okay I mean well you got", "to do that at the apartment too but basically it's you the grass needs cutting the walls need painting and it's a lot of work and it doesn't take long you've noticed this you know you you clean a room and it's just the second law of Thermodynamics takes over as things go from order to chaos all by themselves you might live alone and you don't know who's breaking into your house and making it a mess at night but it's just the way it is dishes don't clean themselves grass doesn't cut itself um and roofs is the idea in here they need repair but it's interesting to me there's an external evidence the roof uh is sagging and there's an internal evidence there's there's leaking that's going on and in a you know in the Bible some you know this that the word house isn't just describing a physical house what what are some other metaphors that that the word house is used for in the Bible somebody tell me the word house what else can it be a picture of yeah our physical body right our body Jesus said tear down this Temple or our house that we live in Paul says in 2 Corinthians 5 we get a new house and we get a new body so our physical body what else uh the word house is used in the Bible as a metaphor anybody y speaking about heaven yeah okay what else how about this one unless the Lord the house they labor in vain who build it what's that talking about what raise your hand if you can tell me what what is he talking about in 127 Psalm 127 128 are twin Psalms they go together and if you'll read them all you'll discover Psalm 128 makes it very clear it's talking about the family the House of David is not the house that David lived in the House of David was his family his descendants God said I will build you an enduring house talking about his dynasty his legacy his lineage so it's really true what it's talking about a physical house when someone's a fool the rafters are sagging it's leaking within but it's also true of our physical bodies it's also true really of our families that there starts to become evidence without and evidence within that something's uh not healthy and uh so we ought to be a people who are living a life that is demonstrating that God's helping us to keep up financially physically U mentally uh relationally all of these areas of our life God intends to be in order and when", "we're honoring God we're going to tend toward maintaining those things with God's help um it was Charles Haden Spurgeon who also said a Bible That's Falling Apart usually belongs to someone whose life isn't I like that so the word of God is going to address these areas in our life and if we're walking as wise men and women there should be upkeep of the various areas of our life yeah we all have needs in different areas at different times but we shouldn't be falling apart at the hinges so to speak we'll put this down letter C be wise about worldly wisdom and its ways uh 19 men prepare a meal for enjoyment like I said you had pizza earlier was pretty good and wine makes life Merry and money is the answer to everything and some of you soft at that um because now some of us say well I know the Bible says you know money doesn't make you happy I've heard that people say that and the Bible says that but I'd like to prove it yeah okay give me a chance you know because we've never had any money to really prove it but anyway um furthermore in your bedroom don't curse a king and in your sleeping rooms don't curse a rich man for a bird of the heavens will carry the sound and the wing creature will make the matter known so be wise about worldly wisdom that's the next film put this down number one the world eats or pardon me the world says eat drink and make money this is um it's possible very possible to use logic and come to the wrong conclusion um I don't think it's one of the verses we have here but 1 Corinthians 6:13 there's not it's not on a slide uh talks about how the the body um or food is for body but the body is not meant for immorality why would Paul say that well yes food your your stomach needs food you need do need to satisfy your need to eat your body needs it but just because you may have a physical drive and an urge for food which is natural doesn't mean that you should give yourself to every natural desire you have yes certain drives and needs have to be fed but not all of them at the whim at whatever time you want to you can come to the wrong conclusion food satisfies uh hunger uh wine might make you Merry in in a wedding or whatever but money to satisfy my need for pleasure or happiness is obviously wrong thinking so", "this is worldly wisdom is what he is sharing there that obviously is not to be what we live with or go after it's hard when our whole culture says that we might say yes as Christians I don't but a lot of us are tempted it's very easy to say I just am convinced if I can make enough money all the stress that I'm under will be gone but the fact is a lot of you in the room are making the amount of money that many years ago you never dreamt that you would make or you've made it along the way and yet it didn't remove the stresses in fact to be honest with you it tends to increase the stresses you now have more responsibility more bills more guilt over enjoying some of the things go there's a lot that happens with more money and so more money doesn't necessarily it's not the answer to everything there's nothing wrong with money money is not the root of all evil don't ever say that what is the root of all sorts of evil the Love of Money Paul says instruct those who are rich in this present World which means there were believers who were Rich he wasn't going out to tell Rich unsaved people people anything instruct those who are rich in this present world not conceited or to put their trust on the uncertainty of riches because it can go like that right it can change in a minute and by the way when you die you're leaving it all behind anyway so put this down curses have a tendency of coming back to bite you I remember as a kid um my mom would some sometimes come in and tell me about something I had thinking how the heck did she know about that and her regular phrase was a little birdie told me how many of you had a mom or you say that even maybe a little birdie told me it appears that this is where it came from verse no really I'm not kidding you verse uh 20 it says a bird of the heavens will carry the sound of your curse of the king or of a rich man and that creature will make the matter known so my mom was biblical I just didn't know she was being biblical when she said that and the idea is this once words leave our mouths we lose control over where they go and who winds up um you know I'm sure this has happened to some many of the room you shoot off a", "text to somebody in haste or you're upset and you realize there is no undo on the text there is no actually I have an email service that it it's you say sin and it just Waits a little while like saying are you sure that wasn't dumb okay it doesn't say that but that's just G me a chance to really because what I sometimes do is I'm in a hurry it's not so much that I'm mad but I'm in a hurry and I haven't looked at it and then I realize oh there's a lot of misspelled words I look pretty dumb so I say UND do and then the person thinks I'm smarter than I am so um you know I I mentioned the other day you can you can in your in your haste you can make mistakes and uh certainly when I I dictate to my when I dictate emails or text sometimes I am shocked what Siri thinks I said you know cuz my Siri needs her mouth washed out with soap uh it's like who do you think I am I don't talk like that you know she doesn't say that but um thankfully it was my wife who got the message and said do you know what you just sent and I said yeah I just said something look at it what and of course I have no IDE to erase that either it's just like they're forever you you know um so here's here's a practical one for us in an election year in a in a year where maybe your your guy is not sitting in the Oval Office and uh we we have to be careful cursing a king or cursing a president or a governor or a mayor jot down Exodus 22 and verse 28 here's the command of God you shall not curse God you I would never do that nor curse a ruler of your people even if you cannot in any way respect the man or the woman the person in the office were commanded to respect the office and realized that God allows and even puts people into office he wants there for his own reasons God directed the choice of salt now a lot of people no no no that was the people oh no read it the text God directed the choice of Saul but Saul who was not a man after God's heart was providing for the people the kind of a wanted Head and Shoulders above everybody else a king like the other nations God says you want it you got it", "Toyota no he didn't you you wanted this kind of a leader you're going to have him Daniel says God raises up the basist of men and he puts them over us and we say I know I've seen it I'm I'm aware of that and so it's not always the person that is necessarily going to bring a blessing to our nation sometimes it's the person who is God's judgment or is preparing us for judgment you know we got to remember if God sent the nation of Israel into captivity for 70 years do we somehow think that God won't take America to the Woodshed he doesn't he there is no obligation on God's part for America to exist until Jesus comes back and Jesus is coming soon and I see virtually nothing in prophecy about the United America we say what are you saying I'm just saying I don't see anything about the United States in Prophecy now I hope everyone in this room is not here during the Great Tribulation if you are you don't need to be you can give your life to Jesus tonight and know that you'll be gone and I believe America is going to go further downhill much faster than it is right now you think it's horrible right now wait till all the Christians in this gone if you think it's on a freef fall now we're talking about moving at light speed down into depravity a whole world without Christians who are called Salt and Light salt that preserves slows down corruption light that penetrates the darkness when there's no light and there's no salt there's just corruption it's coming I don't celebrate that we need to be salt and put on the brakes and do everything we can now we need to stand up and be heard but we shouldn't curse Obama or anybody else who God allows to be and enough you say oh well yeah but that verse Pastor that's in the Old Testament that's right you say well that that King that King was a believer in the one true God that he was a Jew don't curse the king he talking about the king you know would have been a believer in God down 1 Peter 2 and verse1 17 cuz I'm glad I asked that honor all people love the Brotherhood fear God we're going three out of three so far honor the king but this is not Old Testament this is Peter let's see who would that have been when Peter wrote it oh yeah Caesar Nero one of the craziest I mean insanely Wicked Emperors whoever lived who by the", "way will kill Peter and Paul that's the king Peter is saying everyone needs to honor Wicked Beyond anybody we've ever known in office in our life or in our nation's history he put tar all over Christians and he burned them on crosses in his Gardens to light them up he was Savage usually Wicked I won't even go into his depravity it's beyond what I would want to talk about in mixed company and Peter said you honor him you honor him so can I suggest to you uh we have no out about the fact that we didn't vote for we don't like he doesn't agree with our views we need to pray for him and if you're not praying for the president and you're not speaking honorably of the office we need to that so so here's another thing you know when somebody puts someone down in your hearing um whether it's gossip or just a negative comment what you can tell them straight from this Bible study when someone puts somebody down you can say according to the Bible that's for the birds in other words hey you never know where that's going to go true story in New York some years ago there were there were two people on a phone call man and woman very gossipy inappropriate conversation that they thought was secret but the phone line happened to be somehow right next to a a line that was connected to a radio station and there was a magnetic storm and their private conversation was broadcast Nationwide and they had no knowledge of it at all and I think of that when I think that you think you're saying something that no one's ever going to hear but Jesus said you're completely wrong jot it down Matthew 12 34 like someone said earlier Jesus said this you brood of vipers how can you being evil speak what is good for the mouth speaks out of that which fills the heart actually that's not the right verse it's the one where Jesus said man will give men will be justified by their words or condemned by the words and men will give an account for every useless or Idle Word in the Judgment every word will come come into judgment before the Lord now I don't believe as Believers that means us see I I believe that everything that's written in the books that we've done wrong has been covered by the blood of Christ but God will judge men for their words and actually their words will justify them or reveal that they Christians or their words will demonstrate that they really", "were not so finally on with regard to speaking as a lot of this has been about speaking and speaking unwisely and foolishly I'll just give this last word of advice often the very easy easiest way to save face is to just keep the lower half of shut and I want to learn to do more of that let's pray father thank you that you give us wisdom Lord you tell us all through the Bible that our mouths were designed by you that we might praise you that we might speak words of Grace but Lord when we're not filled with the spirit of God what comes out of our mouth is well at best just us and unfortunately according to James sometimes it's not even us like job's wife who unknowingly actually tempted her husband to do Satan's bidding and curse you Lord we like Peter would discover that day can become mouthpieces himself when he told Jesus God forbid that you're going to go to the Cross meaning well but completely with a wrong Spirit when James and John wanted to call down fire lord you said you know not what Spirit you're of and so Lord we confess you a lot of times we're ignorant of what Spirit what's controlling our tongue obviously Lord when there's negative fruit when we're hurting people when we're prideful when we're impatient it becomes even obvious to us when we're angry but Lord we want to be filled with your holy spirit so that our mouths are filled with praises of you where we're thankful and we're expressing it where we're telling people we love them we're sorry Lord but that we can share things that will encourage them not flatter them but certainly give them favor and the unmar grace thank you that you speak words like that about us you sing over us because you're Overjoyed with who we are we're not not perfect yet but we're your kids and you love us right now not someday when we achieve a perfect day or in heaven you love us right now you loved us when we had nothing lovely about us at all and you made us your children would you teach us would you help us to be so filled with the spirit of God that we have gracious words just pouring out falling out of our lips and people just can't wait to have a conversation with us because the last time we were with them we blessed them and we left a blessing behind the way you do so help us Lord take over our mouths bring Godly wisdom in us and", "now let's get into the word leviticus chapter 17 open your bibles there and we are going to sacrifice and blood leviticus 17 beginning in verse 1 then the lord spoke to moses and he said speak to aaron and to his obviously remaining sons and to all the sons of israel and say to them this is what the lord has commanded saying any man from the house of israel who slaughters an ox or a lamb or a goat in or who slaughters it outside the camp and has not brought it to the doorway of the tent of meeting the tabernacle to present it as an tabernacle of the lord blood guiltiness is to be reckoned to that man he has shed blood and that man shall be cut off from among his people the reason is so that the sons of israel may bring their sacrifices which they were sacrificing in the open field that they may bring them into the lord at the doorway of the tent of meeting to the priest and sacrifice them as sacrifices of peace offerings to the lord and the priest shall sprinkle the blood on the altar of the lord at the doorway of the tent of meeting and offer up the fat and smoke as a soothing aroma to the lord they shall no longer sacrifice their sacrifices to the with which they play the harlot this shall be a permanent statute to them throughout their generations then you shall say to them any man from the house of israel or from the aliens who sojourn among them sacrifice and does not bring it to the doorway of the tent of meeting to offer it to the lord that man also shall be cut off from his people it's pretty verse 10. and any man from the house of israel or from the aliens who sojourn among them who eats any blood i will set my face against that person who eats blood and will cut him off from among verse 11 is the key verse of this chapter some would say the key verse of the entire book for the life of the flesh is in the blood and i god says have given it to you on the altar to make atonement for your souls for it is the blood by reason of the life that makes atonement therefore i said to the sons of israel no person among you may eat blood nor may any alien who sojourns among you eat blood so when any man from the sons of israel or from the aliens who sojourn among you in hunting catches", "a beast or a bird which may be eaten he shall pour out its blood and cover it with dirt with earth for as for the life of all flesh its blood is identified with its life therefore i said to the sons of israel you are not to eat the blood of any flesh for the life of all flesh is its blood whoever eats it shall be cut off when any person eats an animal which dies or is torn by beasts whether he is a native or an alien he shall wash his clothes bathe in water and remain unclean until evening then he will become clean but if he does not or bathe his body he shall bear his guilt father give us eyes to see the spiritual truths that are eternal and for us tonight we want to see our lord and we want to honor him with our lives in jesus name let me seated hopefully you got an outline and if you're watching online you can pick up the online outline that we put there where you can fill it in most of us heard or seen the commercial over the years from budweiser for all you do this bud's for you you say well that's really sounds like a good sermon material bob well i i can't help but think of that because in this chapter here's what i think about i think god looks at sinful sacrifices his own son and then says to us basically this for all you've done this blood is for you for all you've done and frankly for all you still do this blood is for you and this chapter is all about blood um somebody came to me last wednesday night and i was talking about sacrifice and he said you know you were talking about the blood of the animals he said have you ever have you ever seen uh slaughtered and i said um you know then the steak that i get at the store that's about as close as i got to the slaughterhouse and he said well i grew up at a place at a ranch where i was around that he said you would not believe how much blood we're talking about he said it's it's everywhere it's gory it's some i said yeah i think that a lot of times we as christians don't have much of a sense of how bloody these sacrifices were and how much blood there handled up in the in the tabernacle later in the temple during the times of the temple we read this is hundreds of years later but", "that the blood from passover all the lambs that were slain up at the temple were drained down through channels into the kidron valley into the river that runs between the mount of olives and and temple mount and literally it just flowed red just was red with blood during passover it was a there was a sacrifice well we're going to talk a little bit about blood which is i know for some people kind of a squeamish thing and they don't like it but it's here and it's really important that you take some time to consider it first thing i want you to do we're going to talk about worship remember leviticus is a book about worship it's not just about killing animals and it's not just about but it's teaching sinful man how to approach a holy god and it's all about this is a this is the worship book of the old testament so yeah it's very different than what we no blood here but you need to see where the blood is and how yes it is here put this down see biblical sacrifice ties two biblical sacrifice ties two ships together you say i have no idea what you mean you will in a second here they are put it down see worship come together now here's what god says in the beginning of chapter if you kill an animal and fail to present it to the lord you're guilty before what a lot of us don't understand is how infrequently the children of israel ate we might think well they're slaughtering all these animals they're eating meat all the time no they weren't they very rarely ate meat now they got tired of not eating meat when all they got was and then they started asking god you know we're tired of the men and we're sick of it and where's the beef you know where's and god brings them quail and we know the story but they they only they had some in egypt they talked about sitting by the flesh pot so they had some exposure to meat and certainly they had animals but they didn't have the same diet that we have they just didn't so it was it was a very very special occasion it was very expensive and you've got to remember to kill an animal other than for the lord you've got a problem there if you're killing an animal that's reproducing or is producing wool for instance you're it's like you're selling your house and not making the profit that you're currently making anymore or on your your api you know why it goes to", "zero because these are the animals they need to eventually inhabit the promised land so they're not meat-eaters by and and so mostly what we read about are sacrifices being done but god was telling them because they they did have animals then they could eat meat when you do when you actually kill an animal for yourself to eat it needs to first come to my house that's what god said every time don't go making a you know food out there in in your home or out in the outside the camp no no when you kill any animal you're going to bring it to me some of you had in your home maybe it was your grandparents home or you've seen it the little meme it's a plaque i've seen it for years that says something like this christ is usually in the kitchen christ is the head of this house the unseen guest at every meal and the silent listener to every conversation basically what the lord was saying is this when you have meat on those specially when you have meat i want to meet with you every single barbecue you're going to include me in it and you're going to present it to me and then you're going to eat some of it and actually going to offer some of it to me we need to see this relationship between worship and fellowship because in a lot of times we kind of make those two completely different things in our own minds remember what jesus said many of you know this verse it's used by evangelists uh even though there's a deeper meaning there in revelation 3 20 jesus said i stand at the door and i knock if anyone hears my voice and opens the door i will come into him and what yeah sometimes it's translated fellowship but the actual word in king james is better i will sup or have supper with him it's very interesting if you'll open your life to jesus i'm going to come in and i'm going to have a meal the relationship between eating you know sometimes people kind of joke around about how often we have food like oh calorie chapel and all then i'm sure we can overdo food don't get me wrong but we need to have a biblical understanding of the relationship of food and fellowship and worship um jot down exodus 24 verses 9 through 11. we're out here in the wilderness moses has just received the law in exodus 20 then moses went up with aaron nadab and abayu they're still alive at this point", "and 70 of the elders of israel and they saw the god of israel and under his feet there appeared to be a pavement of sapphire as clear as the sky itself yet he did not stretch out his hand against the nobles he didn't kill them of the sons of israel and they beheld god and what else did they do they ate and drank actually they ate and drank in fellowship with the lord they didn't just go up and see the sight of god they actually partook a food with the lord remember what the bride says in the song of solomon about the bridegroom i believe it's a type of the church in christ he brought me to his banqueting and his banner over me is love jot down acts 10 verses 40 and 41. peter is summarizing the ministry of jesus god raised him up on the third day and granted that he should become visible not to all the people but to witnesses who were chosen beforehand by god that is to us who ate and drank with him after he rose from the dead frankly he's coming well i have to throw that in i mean the resurrection is kind of significant enough nobody i want to tell you we also ate and drank together with jesus after he rose from the dead when do the two on the road to emmaus realize jesus is when he does what when they sit down and break bread and when jesus breaks the bread their eyes are open at that moment john 21 records a resurrection appearance of jesus to peter and the disciples who went out fishing caught nothing they fished all night it's dusk or foggy and and jesus says you guys catch anything and then they wind up realizing it's it's jesus as he tells them how to fish again you know throw the this on the boat and they have this huge catch and they realize oh it's jesus we know who this guy is and and so here's the resurrected lord and what does he say let's have breakfast you would not know breakfast was something that was even eaten in the culture except that experience it's mentioned twice in the whole bible john 21 jesus bakes not fish and chips but fish and bread for them for breakfast very interesting the resurrected lord is eating with his disciples and it's happening again and again and again here's what i want to say to you about the lord intends you to see your worship of the lord and your relationship with like you see a relationship with people", "that you like to eat with heaven is described as a marriage supper did you know that it's like was it never going to end we're just going to keep on eating i can it's starting to feel more like heaven all the time that's not the point of it but you know when it comes to like communion i got to tell you something we don't do communion the way the early christians did at all um and i get it we're very much into i'm having this special relationship with the lord but it is so completely and frankly minimized if you had given the elements that we use to the disciples they would have thought this is not it it was a whole meal it is in my bible they ate a whole meal by the way and by the way the early christians had what they called an agape believe in either so i don't like christians ate meals together when they celebrated the lord's table they did for hundreds of years we don't we have got it now down to one two cups stacked with the bread and the bottom for economy and you know and during covenant even we had those kind of thing wrapped where you'd have to open it up and i mean we are not talking about biblical communion i'm not putting it i am okay i am i'm sorry it is not um the bread they ate this little training rock of bread not that their bread was it was unleavened but um we do a bite i don't it's not even a bite you gotta understand the culture the culture of the middle east to this day and certainly the ancient times was when you had a meal with somebody you are sharing in a life experience that is affecting both of you just think uh i don't know it used to be called don jose i forget rodriguez whatever it's called where you go down and you have tortilla chips and salsa because they would have breads a bread and you would dip it a lot of cultures do this where you dip it in sauces or they call it a sop okay so kind of like when you go out to a mexican restaurant and you have a tortilla and you dip it in the salsa and you take a bite and the person next to you takes their tortilla and dips it in the salsa and they eat theirs now by the way they did they they did they didn't in fact they didn't have any so their idea was what", "i'm eating is going into me and you're eating from that that's going into you and there's the sharing in the same food we are one literally that's how they felt about it we are so weird it's like do you know that they would have never had communion in separate cups why well i'll tell you it's not biblical jesus had one cup it was a third cup of passover and he had one cup how do i know because here's what he said to his disciples drink from it all of you he didn't say pick it out of the tray and get your own and you one cup for everybody you say i don't think the cdc would approve fact is that's the way it was and it was because we are missing this concept that we are with the lord in a meal and we're with each other and it's super important that we catch that or we miss all of it um there's a new well i don't know how new it is but there's this thing they're advertised all the time on fox anyway balance of nature how many of you seen that commercial no so what they've done is they've taken fruits and vegetables dehydrated them down to nothing ground them down and then put them into because nobody's eating as much fruit you're supposed to be eating and nobody's eating enough vegetables you're supposed to be eating so now you don't have to you just take three of these suckers a day pay them way too much money and ask me how i know and uh you are gonna get all your daily allowance and you know what it reminds me kind of reminds me the way we do communion really does kind of like do you remember yeah yeah this is futuristic right so george has rosie the robot making him breakfast which is a and he's going to have eggs and toast and bacon and it's all in the capsule and he's taking the pill as he's walking on the conveyor belt going out the door he says rosie you burn the toast again as he takes this capsule i think sometimes that's kind of our experience with communion compared to the way it's supposed to be it's supposed to be a full-on meal together to enjoy well i share that because if you don't sacrifices were intended to be relational you miss it completely put this down acceptable worship to god does mean being in the right place now look at verse 7 through 9 again they shall no longer sacrifice their sacrifices to the goat demons", "with which they play the harlot this shall be a permanent statue to them but when they offer their sacrifices they have to do it all of them have to do it in the right place the doorway of the tent of meeting and they have to give it to the priest now that's interesting to they were sacrificing the right animals but they weren't sacrificing them in the right place and god said then it's not being sacrificed to me you think you're sacrificing to me on your own doing it wherever you want not you're really doing that to it's and that's fascinating to me jot down ezekiel 20 verses 6 through 8 and please understand that god's people when they first got saved were idolaters back in egypt if you think well they only worship jehovah for 400 years among the not true and this scripture proves it ezekiel 20 verse 6 on that day i swore to them to bring them out of the land of egypt into a land that i had selected for them flowing with milk and honey which is the glory of all lands and i said to them cast away each of you the detestable things of his eyes and do not defy yourselves with the idols of egypt i am the lord your god but they rebelled against me and were not willing to they did not cast away the detestable things of their eyes nor did they forsake the idols of egypt then i resolved to pour out my wrath on them to accomplish my anger against them in the midst of the land of so the reality is this god's people were worshiping idols in egypt and when he talks about the demon the goat demons that was one of the idols that they he went by the name mendez we have a slide to give you a sense of what he looked like mendes if we can put that up there you go actually i think that might be pan but because pan would just be the greek version go ahead and put the other slide yeah this is this is actually mendez the egyptian version but this goat-headed god or a goat god is who we are talking about and it it continued uh to influence god's people even when they were in the land of canaan so if you think about it what the israelites did is they entered into a relationship with god they were saved and they believed in him but remember when moses didn't come down mountain as soon as they had thought he should right he was up there how long", "40 days and 40 nights and it wasn't like they knew he was coming back then in fact he wasn't god had to stop what he was doing to say you need to go down because what did they do while he didn't show up ah they go to aaron our guy aaron and say you know what we don't know what happened to this man moses so we need what do we want when do we want it now we want well that's an egyptian god but we're going to call it yahweh and this is your god that got you out of it they just literally started just practicing idolatry and really breaking the law before it was even delivered it's a very interesting thing and by the way what always associates with idolatry also starts with an i and ends with an e as in a y immorality always always always by the way if you're not sure of this read romans 1 when they reject worshiping god acknowledging god admitting there's a god giving him thanks god gives them over to do depraved things in their body sexual sin always idolatry immorality they go together so when they worshipped this golden calf they ate they drank because there was always food involved in that worship as well and they rose up to play and that was not parcheesi that was sexual sin that they were getting themselves involved with okay so idolatry immorality always are connected to each other and that's why he talks about playing the harlot when they were worshiping the goat what i want to say to us modern day saints feel that well one of these two camps or the worship of god should be and based on solid truths biblically and i agree with that the hymns of the faith are incredibly and biblical songs that are scripture songs and so there's a lot of christians that prefer those because they are less and all about god and we exalt the lord right and you know coming back to the heart of worship and it's all about you and we say amen preach it brother because while that's true there's this weird thing that happens that says if are speaking their hearts to the lord if they're closing their eyes and making the songs of the testimony songs and if they're feeling like that that's that's just fleshly so there are some feel like yeah i don't really get into those kind of hymn songs and theology songs i i want them to be prayer songs and i i want to share my", "heart with the lord i i need to i need to allow myself to feel it you know what both of those truths are legitimate don't exclude the other in your particular preference of maybe what you need but that is why i'm going to tell you passionate singing without personal and i want to say it again passionately seeing the lord like we maybe for most of us which we love but where there's no real self-surrender of the life you're deceiving yourself why do i say that because of what the bible clearly teaches true worship is jot it down romans 12 verse 1. paul says i urge you therefore brethren by the mercies of god present your bodies as a living and holy sacrifice which is acceptable to god and it is your spiritual service of what true acceptable worship involves surrender and it always involves can ever substitute for obedience you might say well what do you mean by that the sacrifice itself doesn't count for anything if i'm sacrificing a disobedient and by the way this is exactly what saul was willing to do in first samuel 15 he disobeys god and he brings some animals he was supposed to destroy and a king who should have been dead bring them back as a war trophy and he brings back the livestock and then when he's called on the carpet for doing so he says i brought these to suck the best of what i was supposed to kill to sacrifice to the lord and what is it that samuel says to him to obey wasn't keith green who wrote that to obey is better than your incomplete obedience is the same thing as witchcraft and sorcery just because you went on the mission and did some of it don't deceive yourself into thinking now that you can sacrifice to god while you're living disobedient to god god is done with you picture it this way a man is having an affair he's married but he's having an affair and he doesn't want his wife to leave him so he sacrifices and buys her a new and she knows that's why he bought it do you think that's gonna work it is not gonna work god's sake that doesn't work with me don't think it's about the way you do the sacrifice and how into the sacrifice if your life is testifying jesus said we must worship the lord in spirit and in truth spirit and in truth worship listen to me it has to be it's grounded in truth has to be and tested based on doctrine we're not to worship with words that", "just because they feel good they have to meet the criteria of scripture worship is also to be emotional i hope you know that and i'll show you why i say that in a minute but that's not even enough that it's both of it's not either or and it's not just both and it also needs to be relational it's about entering into a relationship with god and then it has to include being volitional so what does that mean the use of your will mark 12 and verse 30 listen to what he's quoting deuteronomy you shall love the lord your god with all of your heart all of your soul all of your mind and all of your strength so worship needs to be intellectual it needs to be emotional it needs to be relational it needs to be volitional the bottom line is it needs to be transformational it's don't be conformed to this world but be transformed paul says present your bodies a living holy sacrifice you know it says of the wise men when they came to visit visit they came to worship jesus we've find him who was born king of the jews the bible says they presented their gifts and they bowed down and they worshipped the baby the manger or in when they worshipped it's interesting an angel spoke to them in a dream and it and they went back home a different way than they had come now i know it's talking about a different different highway different road but it is exactly what should happen when you really worship god you should go out a different way than you can by the way do you know when you went into the temple to worship god on the entrance was not the exit you did not go back out the same way you went in it's the way it was set up and the idea is you are going in and allowing god to change you that's the evidence actually that you've been truly now acceptable worship to god in our had to be done at the right place where was it it was of the tabernacle and it had to be involving the right person a priest couldn't do it on your own at your own house at your door with your best buddy who does the door of the tabernacle well the lord jesus john 10 and verse 9 jesus said i am the door if anyone enters through me he shall be saved and shall go out and find patch we know he is the only door i'm the only way to the father", "it's a picture of christ we've talked about this and who is the priest a yeah that'd be jesus too pretty safe guess on all my questions tonight hebrews 13 and verse 15 him hebrews is talking about jesus as the high priest through christ then let us continually offer up a sacrifice of praise to god that is the fruit of our lips that give thanks to so when jesus in john 4 meets a woman of samaria at the well and they have a discussion at some point jesus lets her know he knows a lot more about her than she knows about him who she's living with and who she's been living with and how that she's not and as soon as jesus reveals that to her uh you must be a prophet i perceive your prophet or uh private eye you know i mean you you know stuff that no way anybody would she senses god's spoken her and she changes the subject immediately starts talking theology instead of personal morality she says you know here in samaria the samaritans and our fathers say that we're supposed to worship on mount gerizim which is what you say you're supposed to go to jerusalem and worship at the temple because while jesus said salvations of the jews and basically yeah they've got it right as far as what god has said in the old testament he said something else he said the hour is coming when those who worship are going to worship in spirit and truth and it won't be mount gerizim and it won't be jerusalem i love that what he said i think sometimes christians make a big mistake right here in the way they interpret it what he is saying is what matters is not your physical location geographically but your spiritual orientation that's absolutely true but some people come away with this i don't need to go to church because i consider myself a very very i don't need to be with other christians at church i just it's me and god be careful really really careful with that and i'm going to tell you why to me that's the equivalent of i'm not really attracted to my wife but i'm a very sensual person that sounds like danger the church for worship say i don't need that because i'm worshiping in spirit and truth this principle that we're studying the pastor god said no there's one place and it's in my home it's in my house it's where i meet with my people and the door and the priests are a picture of christ but guess what this is", "the part you don't want to miss that's also a picture of you he said what do you mean do you remember when jesus said to his i give you the keys of the kingdom whoever's sins you forgive they're forgiven if if they reject you they're rejecting me and if they reject me they're rejecting the one who sent me in other words you represent me listen the new jerusalem how do you get into the new jerusalem well there's gates right what are the gates made out of that was one big oysters anyway they're made of pearl now what does the pearl represent in the yeah by the way the pearl is not an old testament gem you won't find it in the breastplate of the of the high priest it it is not even a gem from the earth it is a organic very different kind of a but when jesus gave the parables of the kingdom matthew 13 he talked about the pearl that a merchant came seeking find pearls and upon finding one of great value he sold all that he had that he might have that do you understand that the pearl it's you we who were the impurity covered and clothed you know how pearls are created right in the garments of righteousness of talk about beauty for ashes that's what he's made us he's made us a thing of beauty we brought him nothing but the impurity he's covered us in his own righteousness that we might give glory to him but listen to me the gates in it's the pearl is the pillar and foundation of truth now listen this starts to sound really catholic because i say it like that's but that's what he says what does he say where two or more are gathered in my name there am i in the midst now listen i can go out to the desert i can go out to the ocean i go over the mountains look at the sky and i can see the grandeur of god and my heart is full to sing to him don't get me wrong i think you should be able to see god everywhere and connect with him but if you want to worship god and meet with god and enjoy god's presence guess where he says you do it with my people that's why we need to be together that's why watching a church service will never for you all that god wants to do in your you cannot it's like saying you go out to reunion uh order uh the chicken cob i'll go order uh i'll", "sit somewhere else and then we'll feel like we were together we both ate the same food didn't talk at all no that's not fellowship jesus rises from the dead and he starts a lot first to mary right peter and john go to the tomb sees actually cephas has his own appearance if you read first corinthians 15 we don't read about in the gospels but he we have two guys on the road to emmaus luke 24. we talked about that jesus is with them they don't know it he reveals himself they say man this is great they get up they were tired it was nighttime and they hot footed back to jerusalem they find the disciples and they say he's alive and they go yeah we already knew that then why did we run back but they they they're all excited because they've and then while they're talking about jesus who shows up by the way they eat too this is just saying he said give me does it go steph let me the spirit let me give me some fish jesus starts appearing but there was one disciple i do not know where tommy was maybe he was i don't know jesus was dead i don't know on that sunday where jesus was appearing and did not believe or said he wouldn't be i refuse you guys are all nuts unless i have my own personal experience now at the point which thomas said that jesus could have gone to thomas's wherever the motel i don't know wherever thomas was staying i mean jesus could do that he does reveal himself to saul the road to jesus but he doesn't when does jesus reveal himself to thomas when they're all gathered not until they're gathered is it just me trying to read into it or is the lord trying to say that's when you're going to meet me when you meet with my people you say well that's the problem see baba i mean i i love the lord but church is there's so many imperfect people and i it it's just people have let me down and failed me and pastors have blown it and not like jesus because i'm one of those that are not like jesus all the time i wouldn't use us either okay speak for myself i won't use me but can i tell you something that i've learned and i'm still learning it even as a pastor critical god's people jesus doesn't go yeah i know really bugs me that she's that way my because he knows way more of the imperfections of his bride than i'll", "and he loves his bride completely right then so when i'm impressed with how messed up he's not and when i'm criticizing her you know you want to offend me criticize my wife to my face or to anybody else or my children even if you're right offense so be really careful when you start to separate i have a relationship with god on my own and i don't need church and i don't go there but god says that's not the way you're going to meet with me it's not going to happen and again i'm not saying that the lord's not with you but something he chooses to do he chooses only to do when you're with other people and gather it in his name now maybe we're going are you saying god's not with me unless i'm a church no i'm saying he's with you in a way he unless you're with other christians meet him at the door get the priest involved that's jesus but it's his it's the people it's an amazing thing so i want to encourage you in that to when people say well i'm i'm not religious i don't care about being religious i don't i don't like church but i'm very spiritual i red bells go off in my head no flags go up when i hear people make that claim because i don't think it's biblical at all okay put this down see why god sees the blood as holy he says a lot about blood in this passage and we need to take some time the first thing that uh i want you to do is jot down exodus 22 and verse 31. remember in the new testament when jesus said don't give what is holy to dogs this is the background he said you shall be holy men to me therefore you shall not eat any flesh torn to pieces in the field you shall throw it to the dogs and the idea is that that which is holy jesus is talking about you don't give it to the wild animals you don't cast your pearl before swine they won't appreciate it and they will actually become pigs that he was talking about so the blood is talked about a lot in our text so put this down it must not be treated as common the blood and we're talking about the blood of animals too not just the blood of this of of of christ verse 10 of 17 says any man from the house of israel or from the aliens who's sojourn among you who eats any blood i will set my face against that person", "who eats blood and i'll cut him off from his people you're not allowed to eat it verse 12 and 13 repeats it therefore i said to the sons of israel no person among you may eat blood nor may any alien eat blood verse 13 so when any man from the sons of israel or from the aliens who sojourn among them in hunting catches a beast or a bird which may be eaten it's clean he shall pour out its blood and cover with earth very interesting the value of the blood feel that gasoline is expensive right i mean it's sometimes over six dollars a a gallon of blood costs fifteen hundred and that's for regular god does things with blood that you don't see anywhere else and not just one of the most valuable liquids on is actually the blood of the horseshoe crab it's sixty thousand dollars a gallon that animal's blood which is used to it's actually used to determine whether a certain vaccine has a bacterial uh contaminant or not sixty thousand dollars for a gallon of that stuff animal blood was never to be eaten but it was commonly done in the ancient but god says my people aren't gonna do it you you pour it out if you kill an animal you pour out and you give the blood a proper burial basically but jot down hebrews 10 verses 28 and 29 anyone who has set aside the law of moses dies without mercy on the testimony of two or three witnesses how punishment do you think he will deserve who has trampled underfoot the son of god and has regarded as unclean the blood of the covenant by which he you've insulted the spirit of grace god says the way you treat blood is super in the sacrificial system that god has instituted blood is used as a cleansing hebrews 9 and verse 22 points that out according to the law one may almost say all things are cleansed with blood and without the shedding of blood there is no forgiveness that's very interesting so blood wasn't to be something for the intake of calories that you eat but for the outtake of impurities something that could make you wasn't supposed to become part of your diet it'd be kind like this you know we use soap or detergent to wash our clothes and to wash our dishes but i don't want to drink a cup of it when i'm thirsty okay it's that's the wrong use of it basically the only blood that is ever to be consumed in the bible is christ's", "he said what john 6 verses 53 and verse 15 to 55. listen to what jesus said he said to them truly truly i say to you unless you eat the flesh of the son of man and drink his blood you have life in yourselves he who eats my flesh and drinks my blood has eternal life and i will raise him up on the last day for my flesh is true food and my blood is drink so the blood of the animals the blood of the sacrifices while the sacrifices represent christ their blood was never to be drank and you weren't to eat the animals with the blood in it it a sin against god to do so and obviously the drinking of christ's blood is not in taking the value of what his blood was shed for it's per remember when jesus said this if anyone is thirsty let him come to me out of his innermost being as the scripture is said he who believes in me will flow rivers of living water so drinking of christ or for that matter partaking of his body eating it or drinking his blood is taking the life of christ the sacrifice of christ and personally accepting him receiving it internalizing it that's what he's talking about that's the only allowed eating of blood but it's metaphorical then put this down god declares and this is the main point of the passage the life is in the blood the life is in the blood look at verse 11 for the life of the flesh is in the blood and i have given it to you on the altar to make atonement verse 14 for as for the life of the flesh its blood is the world book encyclopedia describes blood this way it says blood is the life stream of the human the life of the flesh is in the blood physiologically which is interesting because here is god declaring this in the 15th century bc do you know when modern science figured this out it was 1628 80. like over 3000 years it was a guy named dr harvey identified the importance of the red fluid isn't that interesting it took man 3 000 years to catch up with what god said the life is in the blood do you know as recently as the 19th century when people were sick you know what they did they because of the ancient greek false understanding of man that you had and blood was one of those bible is another there's others that you have these humors that had to be kept in", "balance and if you're sick something's out of balance and blood since it's you know it's probably the cause so we're gonna just take some of that out and kind of balance you out and it was weird how come most people just died but i guess we got maybe lots of more should have let more blood out sooner i don't know it was that crazy but that we're talking 3000 years before that god was saying hello the life is in the blood i'm not sure anybody was listening is an amazing part of your body um let me read you what it does among other things the blood acts both as a carrier and as a regulator within the body it by the way your body will pump 51 million gallons of blood in a 70-year lifetime 2000 gallons a day your body is pumping your blood uh it has tasks that it won't fail to perform at every moment throughout that journey it does communication the blood is responsible for nearly all communication within the body it is the lungs of the body because blood carries oxygen to every cell of the body it provides energy raw materials necessary for the cells to obtain energy are transported in the blood your blood is your thermostat of your body the blood adjusts the body's temperature just like an air conditioning unit thanks to its circulation our body temperature always remains the same and it is a fascinating thing how it does it has to do with how small your capillaries get and the blood s the red blood cells have to go in single file and it has to do with the friction that it creates and it maintains your body exactly at the same temperature you get disease protection the blood flows the defensive antibodies and white in it are on constant duty they are always on guard against germs that might enter the body it provides food for those cells the blood is they're responsible for providing the body's nutrition foodstuffs are distributed to every cell by means of the blood it is your body's sewage system the veins and arteries also act as a sewage system in which waste products and toxins are carried away think of your liver and your kidneys and by the way the carbon dioxide that comes out through your lungs all through the blood it is the repair shop for the cells in your body um blood clots it's an amazing thing when you start to bleed a signal goes out that says hey we've got a leak over here and the platelets in the blood line up", "to come together and attach themselves to one another to stop the leak and to mend the tear and allow the injury to heal what would david say i am fearfully and and i know it very well world book encyclopedia says no part of the body can live without this red fluid the the blood is essential for life obviously these ten pints that were it's an amazing thing how um the blood it we manufacture it you mostly you know this we manufacture of course in our bone marrow but the life expectancy of the blood that's produced is about four months i didn't know that every single day two ounces of blood expire did you now the red blood cells are so small it takes 3 200 of them to line up to be one inch if you could line them up that's how small they are but the bone marrow produces two million blood cells every second to replace those that are dying so if you give a pint of blood your body just knows to do this starts to make blood at five times the normal rate and within 10 days you're back up to the limit of what you need it's amazing and yet man didn't understand this and is still learning about it all the time so the the your physical blood is obviously precious um but put this down number three shed blood is how to have put in the word atonement in three words at one mint at one minute that's what it says in verse 11. i've given the blood for atonement and i think at one minute is the excellent way to understand the word atonement which means covering but the idea is that to make us reconciled with through this chapter you repeatedly hear him say things like the soul that sins well through the bible will surely die he'll be cut off from my people or he'll be put to death is the idea and so there's this death sentence on the sinner we've been separated and alienated from god and man has this deep inner sense every single person of their need for god there's this some have called it a god-shaped void every person is made to know god to glorify god though they may not believe in god they long to be fulfilled and so they are looking for ways many times without god to try to deal with that sense of loneliness that sense of emptiness that sense of purposelessness or hopelessness because without god we're without hope in the world the bible says and people", "turn to all kinds of things some of them are illegal and immoral and other things are fine and legal and moral but they're going to be the reconciling work that christ alone but people get very uncomfortable with talking about blood listen to this peter marshall he was the chaplain of the united states senate in the 1940s when he first arrived in washington dc to pastor new york avenue presbyterian church an elderly lady greeted him saying i do so hope you won't talk too much about the blood as our previous marshall said i promise i won't talk too much about the blood because it's impossible to talk too much about the blood that's exactly right it is our lack of understanding of what god did in giving his son to us and finally put this down number four dead or damaged must be cleansed or condemned in verses 15 and 16 he talks about an animal that died you found it and it's dead basically god said you cannot eat um you're not the you know you're not the hillbillies no roadkill if you do you're unclean if you ate an animal that was wounded you were unclean what does and we hear this all the time you are what you eat well you don't eat something that is unclean or is likely to be unclean and if you don't get washed after becoming unclean then your sin remains so either you get washed or you get wiped out put in the word cleansed and condemned if you didn't get those two in in essence it's kind of like this as a sinner i need to see i am like that i am dead in my sin i am damaged because of my sin and i have a choice i need to be either or i'm going to get wiped out that's the president lyndon johnson's daughters by an inquisitive journalist to describe her relationship with her and without more than a moment's hesitation she replied blood that was her answer tell me about your relationship with the president blood what is your relationship with father god because if it doesn't include the word you don't have one there is no relationship with god the father except through the of jesus christ there there is nothing else that could exist and you need to celebrate that he was willing to shed his precious blood for you his name is william cooper looks like it would be pronounced calper but it's not it's cooper cooper was uh raised in england when he was six his mother died his father was a chaplain", "he wasn't really sure where he stood spiritually as he grew up but he struggled he struggled a lot emotionally he would spend time in a mental asylum he would go through lots of depression he was trying to be a lawyer actually he studied for law and he was going to actually have an opportunity to serve in the house of lords big job and he had a and he couldn't he didn't get the job he wound up going into a lot of depression after that he actually tried to commit suicide he would come to believe that his failure to be able to take his life was the providence of god and god protected his life his story is sad in a lot of ways but along the way he met a pastor who had been the captain of a slave ship who wrote amazing grace and he went to live with him and together they wrote some hymns and probably the hymn that will outlive him because it already has is one that some of you grew up singing it's based on zechariah 13 1. zechariah 13 1 says in that day god says in the future a fountain will be open for uncleanness and iniquity for the descendants of david and the jerusalem with all of his failings and all of his sin in his life and disappointments and sadness he wrote these words there is a fountain and it's filled with blood drawn from emmanuel's and sinners plunged beneath that flood lose all their guilty stings and he saw himself as that very person that needed that kind of forgiveness and one of the other stanzas i'll close he said this the dying thief rejoiced to see that fountain in his day and there may i though vile is he wash all my sins away and i believe no matter what you're doing whatever you've done no matter how hopeless it seems that there's no way to get back to where you used to be want to be should be the blood of christ is sufficient to cleanse every sin you'll ever commit believe it accept it receive it and let him restore you tonight if we can't study the blood and see our lord i don't know a chapter in the bible that doesn't shout to us as loudly as this one does of the love that you have for us that you would crush you said in isaiah 53 your son you didn't just allow him to but you crushed him you put him to death and jesus no one took your life from you including your", "father but you gave it willingly and it is your blood alone that commends us to your father we are blood brothers we are related forever because of your blood and i thank you that it is just as powerful just as able to cleanse us tonight as it ever has been so lord help us to celebrate what you've done help us to respect that the life is in the blood but the eternal life is in yours in jesus name i pray amen let's all sing together let's all day and night night and day day and night night and day you were worthy someone wrote these words i don't know who it was they said this in my lifetime i've never owned a rolex or a yacht i've never known anyone who did in my lifetime i have never nor will i ever slam dunk a basketball because i am i will never know the joy of riding the derby winning philly because i am too big to be a jockey i will never pastor a mega church because there are simply things in this life that are not meant for me these things never were and never will be for me but there is however something that was meant for me and it's greater than all of these things that are not the blood of jesus when his body was broken and his blood was spilled it was and it was for you god bless you", "street and not Calvary Chapel East Anaheim ever the Lord we want to take an honest look into the mirror and not justify ourselves like that Pharisee who could only see somebody more simple in his mind than him the Lord that we might be honest to God and your spirit might move through the bride right here and Lord would you just do that whole body scan that you do with the word and speak to us about anything you want to correct in our hearts and minds and lifestyle where yours and we want to reflect you in Jesus name Amen all right grab a seat outlines in your bulletin or you can look at the app if you like so coming back to our study here we're going to look at four more qualities this first one there in verse three is that men or people will be brutal brutal and so put this down in the last days they are downright dangerous dangerous the word here brutal is a word that speaks of a wild animal and Savage is the idea I think of what Paul said in Galatians to the Christians in the churches of Galatia evidently there were problems by the way that if you don't know this the churches of Galatia seem to move away from that walk by the Spirit of God we're more focused on on the performance and on legalism remember Paul's that by this spirit would you be perfected by the flesh and they were focusing on things like circumcision and obeying the law of Moses and it's interesting how Paul said you know where's that joy that you used to have you know you used to be just an on fire for the Lord but now you're all about and when that happens when you're all about performance and you get legalistic you get judgmental and so there were divisions in the body and so Paul has to say to the church at Galatia churches in Galatia if you bite and devour one another meaning you guys are doing that not if you ever should but I know you are if you bite and devour one another take heed lest you be consumed by one another Christian cannibalism he's talking about backbiting and just going at it and how the church could destroy itself even there in the first century in these churches because of their attitude toward each other being vicious shut down Matthew 12 if you were taking notes verses 19 and 20 the opposite of this I think in every quality I've told you this is like filming a camera there's a", "bunch of negatives but if we look at them in the right light we see that the positive which is Jesus here Jesus is described by an Old Testament prophecy he Christ will not quarrel nor cry out nor will anyone hear his voice in the streets a battered Reed he will not break off and a smoldering wick he will not snuff out until he leads justice to victory this is talking about the gentleness of Christ remember he said of himself it's the only self description really Jesus gives us in the Gospels in Matthew 11:28 and 29 I am gentle and humble of heart and lowly and Christ in fact epitomizes the exact opposite of a savage mentality that's all about getting its way and hurting other people who cares and there are some people in our lives or some Christians even we're kind of like Bulls in a china shop they don't care really who they hurt they feel justified because they're speaking the truth or whatever but notice put this down put in the word blow the ticked off tend to blow up and proverbs 29 22 I think is a good verse that deals with this savage attitude an angry man stirs up strife and a hot-tempered man abounds in transgression the Bible has a lot to say about anger and and maybe you do well at church but maybe you struggle with your anger with your family I think God has designed marriage and children to bring out you laughs to not create but to bring out things that we need to deal with in our spirit also the 91 freeway so you know the incidence of road rage is going up every step about 7% a year the incidences of violent road rage in our country and how many people actually are killed not accidentally as a result of road rage it's crazy people lose it everywhere they can lose it in at the happiest place on earth I noticed this last week tempers being lost at toontown there you know listen to this the bombs of World War two are still killing in Europe don't you think that they turn up and sometimes blow up at construction sites in fishing nets and on beaches seventy four years after the guns fell silent beneath the rolling farmland of northeastern France for instance by the way a lot in the news this last week about bombs being found in Pompeii it's a big problem but this one's northeastern France lies a deadly secret from World War one hundreds of thousands maybe millions of unexploded bomb shells every year farmers treasure hunters", "hikers or curious children are killed or maimed because a mishandled or misidentified shell goes off and they said there's unexploded bombs become more dangerous with time with the corrosion inside the weapon becomes more unstable and the detonator can be exposed what's true of lingering bombs is certainly also true of lingering anger people who have been hurt people that have dealt with issues in their life bury it and many times that explode kind of when you least expect it maybe that's true of you maybe you don't even know why you get angry maybe you blame other people it's very common from people say well you know you make me so angry and I always want to remind you if you find yourself saying that remember that's a lie nobody makes you angry that anger is inside of you oh they might find the fuse they might help it to be exposed but the fact is we got to own the problem ourselves some people are like emotional volcanoes and the slightest provocation can cause it to erupt put this down avoid friendships with the that's what the scripture teaches us I know I'll never forget I I had a problem with my temper as a young man frankly it was kind of modeled to me and my home and so when I became a Christian I I you know would sometimes lose my temper and I remember a friend of mine shortly after I got saved with he came to me he said you know Bob we're not sure we're supposed to eat with such a one as you I said what are you talking about he showed me the scripture it talks about not fellowship in nineteen he was somebody who's a hot-tempered you know man and it really convicted me frankly I'm glad he did it I didn't really know how to change myself but I prayed about I said Laura I don't want to be that way I don't lose my friends but the Scriptures actually do command us to avoid people that have a hothead now you say what's my husband I get it you may have married into it but the fact is we need to be careful proverbs 22 verses 24 and 25 I do not associate with a man given to anger or go with a hot-tempered man or you will learn his ways and find a snare for yourself listen to this this is a true story and his autobiography number one Billy Martin he was the manager for the Yankees five times over a second baseman Billy Martin told about hunting in Texas with Mickey Mantle", "Mickey had a friend who would let them hunt on his ranch and when they reached the ranch Mickey told Billy to wait in the car while he checked in with his friend a Mantle's friend quickly gave them permission to hunt but he asked favor he had a pet mule in the barn who was going blind and he didn't have the heart to put him out of his misery he asked Mickey to shoot the mule for him when Mickey came back to the car he pretended to be angry he scowled and he slammed the door Billy asked him what was wrong and Mickey said his friend wouldn't let them hunt I'm so mad at that guy Mantle said I'm gonna go into his barn and shoot one of his mules Martin protested we can't do that but Mickey said just watch me he jumped out of the car with his rifle ran inside the barn and shot the mule and as he was leaving he heard two shots as he was leaving in the barn he saw that Martin had gotten his rifle - what are you doing Martin he yelled Martin yelled back his face red with anger will show him I just killed two of his cows I don't think there's a better illustration to tell you you hang out with people that are angry it's contagious it's infectious be careful you don't learn their ways put this down not only are they brutal that they have an appetite an appetite for evil interesting what it says there in verse 3 they are haters of good the Greek is simply without a love of the good phileo agatha says love of what is virtuous are good and then has the alpha primitive so without they don't have a love of the good so it's translated haters of what is good they hate good things virtuous things they actually hate good people interesting you know sometimes people in neighborhoods hate the police so much they will hate somebody who decides to report a crime they they they're angry at that person who's doing the right thing and that can be expressed in lots of ways this hatred of what's good put this down don't let your values become inverted the world is will always invert your values put in the word inverted Jesus had this blessed are those who hunger and thirst after but you can start to look at people who are hungry for God's Word as wow they're over the top you know they're just religious nuts or people that are passionately worship you learning how they think that really spiritual when", "you think that way just remember you're a whole lot like David's wife Michael who got judged because she couldn't understand the passion that David had in worshiping the Lord be careful in your heart that you don't start becoming critical putting down actually hating things that are good Isaiah 5:20 is that classic verse we usually think of our world system and it certainly describes a victim we can start to describe people in the church - what are those who while they get it backwards call evil good and good evil who substitute darkness for light and light for darkness who substitute bitter for sweet and sweet for bitter that is unfortunately the character of the world it should never be the character of somebody who calls themselves a Christian it can happen lots of ways there's just an appetite maybe for violence maybe they you love violent movies and you know you just think it's because you're a guy or you love you know those violent video games or maybe profanity-laced music just disgusting lyrics horrible things but that's what entertains you jot down Ephesians 4 verses 17 through 19 Paul here telling Christians actually in the same church that Timothy is pastoring an emphasis that we are to be different than the world so this I say an affirm together with the Lord you walk you live you behave no longer as those who don't know Christ as Gentiles also walk who walk in the futility of their own minds they are darkened in their understanding they don't get it they're excluded from the life of God because of the ignorance he's talking about not having a relationship with the Lord the ignorant that is in them because of the hardness of their heart and they have become callous and they've given in their callousness given themselves over to sensuality for the practice of every kind of pure impurity with greediness basically what he's saying is don't be like you were but you weren't saved don't be the world around you that has this callous heart towards spiritual thing sin will harden your heart do you know the Bible calls us to be in fellowship with each other more often than probably any of us are a lot of us have a fellowship deficit you might say why come to church on Wednesday nights clad but here's what the Bible says in Hebrews 3:13 encourage one another the word is part a lot will come alongside to help each other day after day as long as it is still called today last time I checked it was lest any of you be", "hardened by the deceitfulness of sin we need to be with each other in the presence of God more often because sin has this tendency to harden our hearts you know I would watch guys become police officers and you know the people that we deal with as police officers aren't your most friendly people our customers are usually you know the tough people and we see some horrible things and of course I'd see their attitudes many times get jaded they just their hearts become hardened toward people suffering but you don't have to be a cop to have that happen to you the world will do that to you that stuff that we watch it on TV the things we entertain ourselves with will do that to us but the Bible says this in Ephesians 5 as Christians we're not to participate in the unfruitful deeds of darkness but we are to expose them we're to see that that's not the way we should be and we're actually the word exposed can be translated word to rebuke them say that's wrong we need to call sin a sin you know the beginning of the fifth century it's an interesting believer by the name of Atilla I can hardly pronounce his name Telemachus yep Telemachus Telemachus was a monk he was an ascetic he spent most of his time frankly just nurturing a garden and prayer and fasting and that's how he lived his life but God revealed to him that he should go to Rome now by the way in the beginning of the fifth century just to give you a little history Christianity was no longer an illegal religion was no longer persecuted Constantine early fourth century had come to faith and now by the end of the fourth century 380 actually ad Christianity was the state religion so Rome was now the capital of Christianity and here in the beginning of the fifth century in 404 he makes his waste travel several weeks God put on his heart to go to Rome he didn't know why God told him to go when he got there he saw these throngs of people so he just got mixed up with them all going into the Colosseum 80,000 people strong Coliseum sat and it was a festival that was going on and actually it was gladiators fighting down he had never seen anything like this to the death down in the arena and as the fight started of course people started begging for more blood more violence I've been going out for 400 years you know in Rome at this for 600 years actually it's been", "going on for a long time so it was normal in Rome he had never seen this thing before where men are just butchering each other and and people are celebrating it couldn't get enough and it so offended him that he stood up he was up in the upper part of the costume he just yelled out in the name of Christ stop nobody hurt him it completely drawn out by the crowds in the name of Christ stop he couldn't believe what he was seeing nothing changed he made his way down all the way down to the bottom climbed over the wall unto the arena and he was yelling at these gladiators that were fighting in the name of Christ stop people in the stands thought it was part of the entertainment he walked over and he he is a little guy little scrawny guy separated these two big gladiators that were fighting to their death already somewhat injured and when people realized what he was trying to do they got so angry they actually tore up some of the stands the marble stands they got angry at this guy what is this guy doing interrupting you know our entertainment and one of the gladiators took the sword and shoved it into him and he literally died in a pool of blood right there on the arena this godly man and with his dying breath he just had to get in the name of Christ stop word spread quickly through the arena who he was he wasn't a slave he wasn't a prisoner of worth it's a gladiator he was a saint history tells us that somebody in the top stands first when they realized who he was felt so convicted they just they just left the stands went silent and one by one the people all of them left the stadium four days later the Emperor on arias who was a Christian declared the fights illegal and from January 1st 404 ad they were never permitted again in the Roman Empire one man one man who said I'm gonna stop this as best I can Who am I I have no power listen God is calling me and you to stand against the flood of violence and iniquity in this world we can't stop it in and of ourselves but we should be counted in the forces that are saying enough abortion enough bloodshed enough violence what do we lit it's time for the church to rise up and speak but they have an appetite for real that'll be the nature of the church in the last days you know put in this fill-in if you", "would don't give hate safe harbor in your own heart I want you to jot Titus 3:3 down because Paul gives in one verse kind of a vignette of what unsaved life was like before we were Christians and I pray it doesn't describe you at all but it Paul says it did him Titus 3:3 he said for we also once were foolish ourselves we were disobedient to God we were deceived we were enslaved to various lusts and pleasures describes our life listen to what he says we were spending our life in malice and envy hateful and hating one another now for some of you go just describes where I work that's what people do gossiping about this person hating this person the management and the people and other problems of just between people just kind of normal Paul says that's the way we were we were full of hate don't be a hater the devil is a hater he drinks haterade I think of Jonah in the Old Testament delivers God's message as he was graced to even survive his rebellion against the Lord and yet although God forgave him for that rebellion and saved him and he did deliver the message forty days and Nineveh will be destroyed the fact as he was hoping it would be he had a reserved seat for the Nineveh firework show that got canceled and that offended him you know you could be saved for a long time serving the Lord and still harboring hate maybe it's for a type of people maybe it's prejudiced in your heart towards some group of people or maybe it's not maybe it's for one person who has wronged you or your family don't harbor hey put this down literacy they betray their loving loyalty they betray their loving loyalty this third word that we look at here is found in verse 4 the first word it's simply in my translation treacherous word could be translated traitors disloyal of course we think of Jesus as John sees him on the white horse and his name is called faithful and true in other words he keeps his promises he does what he says he'll do he's the exact opposite of this quality this quality is probably seen in the person of Judas who remember betrays Jesus in the garden with a kiss you know to worship the Lord the the greek word to worship what we just did one of the words is the word proskuneo Kineton to kiss and Pross means toward to kiss toward the Lord and the ideas of expressing affectionate surrender to God", "I love you Lauren well what a what a hip hypocrite who would go through the motions of loving Jesus while he's betraying him and so Jesus says do you betray me with a kiss really Jesus said this people honors me with their lips but their hearts are far from me they're going through the motions they're saying all the right things they're taking communion they're listening the words they're bringing their kids but their lives are far from me it's just a facade it's not genuine loyalty we are to be people of our word we are to be people of his word and we're to be people who can be counted on put this down they break God's covenant commands shut down Malachi 2 10 and 11 this issue of treachery is dealt with in Malachi 2 Malachi says do we not all have one father has not one God created us why do we deal notice treacherously each against his brother so as to profane the Covenant of Our Fathers Judah has dealt treacherously and an abomination has been committed in Israel and in Jerusalem for Judah has profaned the sanctuary of the Lord which he loves and has married the daughter of a foreign god so this prophet brings up treachery among God's people in the way they deal with each other and then specifically mentions the fact that they are marrying outside of Judaism they're not marrying into the faith listen God doesn't want you as a believer to marry anyone you don't want to marry but you as a believer shouldn't be willing to marry anyone God doesn't want you to marry either jot down second Corinthians 6:14 do not be bound together or unequally yoked with unbelievers for what partnership has righteousness and lawlessness or what Fellowship has light with darkness I tell people this if you as a believer marry an unbeliever you will have in-law problems do you know who your father-in-law will be Satan spiritually your marrying into that by disobeying God's command God says my people are dealing treacherous with each other and they're dealing treacherously with my covenant put this down they break their own covenants they break their own covenants not just God's Malachi 2 goes in verse 15 and 16 listen to what he says but not one has done so who has a remnant of the spirit and what did that one do while he was seeking a godly offspring listen to what he says take heed then to your spirit let no one deal treacherously against the wife of your youth for I hate divorce says the Lord", "the God of Israel and him who covers his garment with wrong says the Lord of hosts so take heed your spirit that you do not deal treacherously I've said before that the divorce statistics here in California are far worse than they are in the world about 74 percent of marriages that happen here in Orange County end in divorce where it's about 50 percent but unfortunately the statistics are not too good for the church having anything better than reflecting the divorce statistics of the world and I know in a congregation this size or any size we have many victims of among us whose spouse who said I do didn't didn't commit till death do you listen to this I find this shocking but I guess it's just the way things are scotty wolf holds the record for the number of times married in divorce he's in the world book of record 29 times he died in 1997 in Redlands at the age of 89 years old by the way he was a Baptist minister yeah a Baptist minister holds record for divorces and three marriages he had approximately 40 children one of his sons that his father said his father was picky and stubborn I guess so he divorced one wife for eating sunflower seeds in bed and another one because she used his toothbrush didn't know that was grounds when he died of all the wives he had no one came to claim his body and no one wanted to pay for his funeral expenses sounds like a personal here's a guy who's a pastor who holds the record for divorces and most marriages fail because people bail other commitments I think of what Winston Churchill said during World War two when the people of England said we need to capitulate we need to surrender he said victory never comes by evacuation stay in stay in it don't give up I heard this woman that had a wedding ring on and somebody said why are you wearing your wedding ring on the wrong finger she said because I married the wrong guy I think that's gonna solve I went to a wedding here dot no it was a while ago now Tom Chapman University in their chapel there and I'll never forget the vows they had written their own vows one of the vows that they made to each other was I promise to love you as long as love shall last and I now know it was about three years pastor went to fourth grade class to kind of talk about marriage to fourth graders he said I", "don't know if any of you know much about marriage and and what God has to say about marriage one little boy said I know something kept waving and saying what's that he said what God says about marriages Father forgive them for they know not what they do well the fact is here's an area according to scripture where believers are dealing treacherous with each other and I say as Christians we need to support people who are going through marital difficulties certainly we need to forgive people who have sinned in this area but as they're entering in making those decisions we need to support what God's word has to say don't give up God hates divorce you hate it too now let's see if God can't heal this listen God can forgive any sin if two people are willing to participate you can't make someone reconcile with you the Bible says and so far as it is possible with you be at peace just don't be party to it don't don't encourage and don't support it say and get rid of them they're a bummer there she's up whatever just being prayer that God would do a work of redemption but this is one of the areas in the church that the Bible says they will not have their loyalty they'll be treacherous then put this down letter do you think before you react think before you react here in verse four the next word is simply reckless King James says heady I don't like that translation heady that sounds like it's dealing with pride it really isn't this word literally in greek means to fall forward headlong and it's it means to speak or act impulsively so put this down don't open your mouth before putting your mind in gear reckless a gentle McArthur described it as a driverless car that's just careening down the course we have driverless cars now but when he wrote it you know somebody no driver of the car is just careening down the road hitting things along the way a person completely out of control they don't care who they hurt it's just that's the way they're living their life so put in the word before don't open your mouth before putting your mind in gear jot down proverbs 12 and verse 18 there is one who speaks rashly like the thrusts of a sword but the tongue of the wise brings healing in other words they don't really care they just say things you know and some people I've mentioned this before being sarcastic and I'd fallen into this myself I heard what I was thinking about", "myself I find myself more sarcastic the farther I am away from the Lord I've never known the Lord to motivate me to say something sarcastically and so I've started to use that as a gauge what I've started to be for but I think it's so cute so funny haha and God's like now no care in heaven so you know be careful that you don't just say things and you feel like well I'm just kidding I'm just joking they know we put each other down it's kind of the way we are be careful like the thrusts of a sword your mouth is like the thrust of us or you don't know who you might be hurting jot down proverbs 26 verses 18 and 19 like a madman crazy man who throws firebrands arrows and death so is the man who deceives his neighbor and says oh hey I was just kidding I was just joking a lot of times when were hurt maybe disappointed discouraged is when we're tempted and we often will make a rash remark that will regret later certainly in a marriage or in a family situation words sometimes come out that you say ma'am I shoulda said that but you can't get them back one of the things I tell couples that are getting married is they need to have rules for fighting just like in a boxing you know there's certain things you just don't do I'm not saying you don't have to go through times when you disagree with each other but you should learn to disagree with some rules because your tendency will be all is fair in love and war and you'll say things that you know you'll say things I wish I never married you you know or we should get a divorce those should be off the table those aren't part of your vocabulary Becky and I made that decision before we got married we weren't going to use the D word we're not gonna ever say I don't you know what I don't want to be married to you so you know you look for something to say when you're upset with the other person so what we say to each other is is when we're upset we'll say I'll bet you wish you didn't marry me you say well that really must hurt Bob it's like hitting with a feather yeah but it's kind of a blessing because when we say that it gives an opportunity for the other person to say and every time we've had a problem you know we say of course that's not what I'm saying I suppose you want", "to be mean oh yeah exactly right I'm sorry but no we don't do that to each other but but I I think of this this idea of opening your mouth and hurting somebody else or saying something you wish you didn't jot down job six first three verses here we know job is one of the most righteous men who've ever lived in fact he was accused by his friends of doing something wrong and that's why God was punishing him but we know that wasn't true but very interesting what job says job six then job answered oh that my grief all my losses my children my slaves and my servants and my my wealth all that my grief were actually weighed and laid in the balances together with my calamity for then it would be heavier than the sand of the Seas notice therefore and because of the deeper my words have been rash very interesting as you look at jobs life he never has to repent for something he has done but he does at the end of the story have to repent for things he said I opened my mouth and I spoke as I should spoken someone who said you can take the word think because we should think before we speak and just kind of break it down and say is what I'm about to say T is it is it true first of all if is it true secondly is it helpful it might be true but it doesn't mean it's helpful is it innocent you have no desire to really hurt someone with it is it M necessary to say it and is it K is it kind put this down number two faith doesn't see any need to hurry this whole idea of doing something wrong hurtful or speaking hurtful words many times has to do with the fact that we're not walking by faith the Bible says he who believeth will not make haste not being a hurry but when I speak quickly when I make a decision quickly or impulsively I think of how gyruss came to Jesus because his daughter was at the point of death that's what you call nine-one-one in those days you know hey come now she's about to die and so Jesus said I'll come so the ambulance from heaven is on its way the you know the medics are Jesus Christ is coming and if you remember the story while Jesus is coming a woman in the crowd who'd had a hemorrhage of blood for 12 years she'd had a problem for years this is not urgent as this", "other call but she reaches out and touches his hem of His garment you know the story she said if I touch it I'll be healed and sure enough she wants and Jesus doesn't say wow I've got to get to gyruss his house left to deal with this later or hope she appreciates the healing no he stops everything turns the lights and siren off turns around said who touched me and I'm sure gyruss is going who cares come on we gotta get there and nope power went out of me I'm gonna deal with this remember he deals with the woman who come for and says it was me and he says your faith has made you well and so much of a delay evidently happened that the people from Jarvis's house came and said don't bother him anymore she's dead and the terror that must have come in desires to know his dot is too late it's he didn't imagine Jesus could do anything at that point it's too late I'm sure he wasn't too happy with that woman who had the hemorrhage of blood it had to touch Jesus right now and Jesus just looks at him and says just believe just believe right now God's got this under control but you see it is when we feel like things are out of control it's too late God didn't work and I'm disappointed it's then that we tend to freak out open our mouths say things that we shouldn't say and we blame God if that little girl was in a hurry to get to church and she's running down the street she kept saying it over and over God told me to be late don't let me be late don't let me be late and she tripped on the curb fell down got up said God don't let me be late but don't push me either yeah when people are upset they say or do things that aren't always best like that little girl who said here's my wisdom to share with other kids my age never asked your mother to comb your hair after arguing with your dad put this down there's no cure for a rash vow people sometimes make emotional decisions with inadequate thought put into it years ago I saw painting it was a picture of a clerk at a county seat who did wedding licenses and performed ceremonies they have Santa Anna you know and just happened to be there were a couple steps leading down to where the clerk was and watch your step watch your step good advice for anybody who's decided", "let's get married right now yeah why not like the sign I heard of at a tattoo store that said remember it's for good I think of Britney Spears marriage there in Las Vegas with her childhood friend 55 hours I guess what happens in Vegas doesn't always stay in Vegas coz we all know about it the Bible talks about these impulsive dessous Asians in more than one place I think of Jeptha in the book of Judges who after a victory said Lord I'm so excited the first thing that comes out of my house because there were animals that they would keep in the Lord product thing that comes out of my house I'm gonna dedicate to you but what's not an animal that came out of the doors of his house what was it was his daughter oh I didn't mean that huh no I don't believe he sacrificed his daughter I believe he kept her a virgin as the Scriptures teach but she be wailed her virginity he had made a decision that dedicated the rest of her life in a way he didn't I think of Joshua remember how the Gibeonites who were actually not very far away from where the children of Israel were and were afraid of them wiping them out pretended to be coming from a long distance in order to deceive the nation of Israel and Joshua the leader of the nation into believing they were from a far distant land and they should enter into a covenant and the Bible says that they came and they had stale bread of course they had you know used old bread when they left and they they had old worn-out clothes and and wine skins and and Joshua says how do we know when you're not in the land and you know close by him and they said oh why wouldn't we left this bread was hot out of the oven you know and now look I just well stale and or shoes are worn out in this long distance to you and and here's what it says it says that Joshua took some of their provision to investigate it but he did not ask the mouth of the Lord in other words he didn't pray about the decision this is a proverbs 3 situation do not lead on your own understanding we know Jesus said remember Lot's wife in one passage will may I say to you with your decisions remember the Gibeonites don't just go and make an impulsive vow and decision and commitment that you'll regret later take time some of us have", "children and they want us to make decisions right now you know maybe it's something like if we have a puppy if we have a puppy or whatever please that we have a puppy there's only one left and you know here's what your answer is if you need to know now the answer is no if you'd give me some time to pray about it it's probably still no but I'll let you know after I hear from the Lord don't make him pull of decisions and yet it's within our nature maybe because of our experience we've done this before maybe because we think we're just wise but we leave them in our understand listen if Jephthah can do it one of the judges in Israel if Joshua can do it a type of Christ who leads successfully the nation into the Promised Land you and I can do it too we say things we do things that are really reckless and it is going to be the characteristic of people within the church frankly the answer or the summary is this the church is acting just like the world these are qualities we expect to see in people who don't know the Lord they should not be the character of Christ bride so we're going through these seeing things like yeah that's just natural that's just normal that's the way people are right remember how Jesus said this don't just greet those who greet you don't you say hi to people that say hi to you the world does that don't just love people that love you the world does that tax gatherers do that in other words here's the bottom line the difference I mean what's the difference with me and you jesus said to his disciples I send you out as sheep in the midst of wolves I tell you something you can tell my even my kids my grandkids little too you can tell the difference between a sheep II and a wolfy there should be an obvious difference between us and the world around it there would be obvious difference between us and the old us we're called to reflect Jesus Christ we're being conformed more and more into his image so as we look at the mirror I pray you go yeah I don't have that problem don't have that maybe you'll check check check check I'm good today praise the Lord but you should pray as I need to pray search me Oh God try my heart see if there be any wicked way in me and lead me in the way on behalf of our pastors", "and staff we want to thank you for tuning into today's

old testament right now with pastor bob and we also have children's ministry spanish ministry and youth ministry so come out to pastor bob's home group on wednesday evenings and we'd love to see you there thank you so much come out a week ago wednesday night we'd we had a baptism and there's a brief little slide that captures some of that so i just wanted them to put that up so you can see some folks proclaim their faith in jesus christ on wednesday night yeah we don't always get a chance to hear uh much in the way of testimony sometimes we have so many people especially down at uh pirates cove and there's no sound system that can handle it so we had a little bit of a chance that night it was kind of cool we had all ages of course you know some children and then some adults one of the this is uh joe many of you getting to know joe it's pretty has an awesome testimony he was led to the lord by josh zazenoff uh in a local park and he's been coming regularly and now bringing other people that are out on the streets and then another man stood up i never met him before i think his name was ali and he said that he was a muslim but through a brother that attends the church here he finally decided to give his life to jesus christ just recently so we're just grateful to hear what god's doing in lives and celebrating that together i'd like you to open your bibles to first peter chapter 5. first peter chapter 5 as we finish the book beginning in verse be of sober be on the alert your adversary the devil he prowls around like a roaring lion seeking but resist him firm in your faith knowing that same experience of suffering that's being accomplished by your brethren who are in the world and after you've suffered for a little while the god of all grace who called you to his eternal glory in christ himself will perfect confirm strengthen and establish you to him be dominion forever and ever amen through sylvanus or silas our faithful brother for so i regard him i have written to you briefly testifying that this is the true grace of god stand firm she who is in babylon chosen together", "with you sends you greetings so does my son mark greet one another with a kiss be to you all who are in christ father we're grateful for the life and testimony that peter leaves behind us in the gospels and the exhortation that you had him write to the believers in the first century that is eternal so it applies to us today we ask that you would give us ears to hear and a heart to understand and obey lord would you encourage us i know there are some that are having a hard time today going through difficulties others that are facing things and fears that are overwhelming them would you give us insight how to do battle with the enemy and how to stand in the grace and the victory of christ for we ask it in jesus name amen you can be seated the year was 1066 the duke of normandy invaded england with a secret weapon for the first time being used in battle it was the stirrup i know that doesn't excite anybody here but uh that was actually a new invention to give the soldiers that were with them the ability to literally stand up on their horses changed the outcome of battles from then on and i think of that because the scriptures call us to do everything to stand firm against the devil peter or pardon me paul in ephesians 6 repeatedly talks about standing the enemy's onslaught i want you to put this down top of your outline see god's victory circle has standing many examples of the failures of faith strengthens somebody who was weak in to where they become an example of faith you don't have to look far it's all through the bible and i was thinking about some of the most obvious ones to us in the old testament we're studying of course the writings of moses and we're going through the book of and moses is this greatly used man of god but moses had a past moses had committed murder moses had been raised in all the wealth and education of the greatest nation on earth at the time as far as sophistication egypt and yet in all of that god couldn't use him though he thought he was useful in him's own self but rather it would be after he had completely failed at delivering the israelites himself and having to spend 40 years in the desert that he was humble enough that god could start to use him but he committed murder and i think of david we all know david's an example to all the other kings", "everybody's measured against david every and yet we know david had his own and then trying to cover it up by committing really murder he had the power to get bathsheba's husband killed out on the battlefield here are two men that we esteem their faith in god and we should but both of them came from great failings how about the apostle paul who is who's been used more than the apostle paul maybe in all of history to share the gospel he had a passion to share christ but listen you got to remember this be before he had the blood of christ in his message he had the blood of the saints on his hands and he never forgot that and so it is as we come to the end of we're going to be focusing on how to have victory in the christian life we all are facing things that could test our faith and if we allow it take away our faith and destroy our faith and then we come to this subject of grace and you can't escape it nearly every new testament epistle you'll hear grace and peace to you grace and peace to you those are by the way the two greetings that were both the that were common it was kind of like saying hello they would say grace and shalom is the jewish greeting of but theologically they go together for us as believers because we realize we don't really have any experience with until we first embrace the grace of god it is only through god's grace we can ever know any peace with god or in our lives and we're reminded of that constantly well we want to talk about standing in victory in the midst of the fiery trials peter's talking to a group of christians who are about to go through harder things than they already it's always discouraging to think well you're going through really hard times what if these are the good times i hate it right now it's got to get better but what if this is the good time you're going to look back and go i'll give i'll give the new trials but you know he wants to think that way that sounds so discouraging but peter has said don't be surprised at the fiery ordeal that's coming in other words it's hard now you're being persecuted it's going to get worse in fact the things you're going through now are to prepare you for what's yet ahead put this down learn to stand firm in the faith learn how to stand firm in the faith in verse 8", "be of sober the devil prowls about like a roaring lion seeking someone to devour but resist him firm and so we're going to talk about what goes into having victory in a trial and how can i have it right now if i haven't already discovered how to do it now the word that is used here to be sober is used by peter himself in chapter 4 look in verse 7. he says the end of all things is near therefore be of sober judgment and sober spirit for the purpose we need to remember this sobriety we're talking about here has to do with spiritual sensitivities to god which is tuned and refined in our lives through the practice of prayer there's an old seven days without prayer makes one week well that's really true prayerlessness will get us in trouble as everybody throughout the ages of time in their relationship with god when we failed to pray we failed to be in that right place with the lord jot down daniel 6 10. daniel's an example to us of many things a righteous man who went through a lot of trials but faith expressed in prayer is one of them when the people around him who were jealous of him in government couldn't figure anything to you know to to accuse him of they they accused him of having faith in god other than the king and they passed the law that made it against the law to pray not just in school but anywhere but they it was on pain of death if you prayed you died and so they were waiting they knew that he would pray but daniel 6 10 is an interesting verse when daniel knew the document the law was signed here's what he did he entered his house in his roof in babylon he had windows open toward jerusalem you know why he did that because solomon had declared god if your people are scattered throughout the earth and they'll look to the to where you live where your presence is in jerusalem if they'll that's why the jews always pray toward jerusalem by the way if you're on a plane on el al going with us to israel the orthodox jews will get up and actually point toward where they believe jerusalem is did you know that that's what's happening but daniel did it he continued kneeling on his knees three times a day praying and notice also in the midst of it giving thanks that's philippians 4 6 before his god as he had been doing previously my point is simply this he had a prayer", "culture in his life a prayer habit and so when the emergency time came he just simply did what he was used to doing remember jesus counseled peter and the other apostles there in the garden of gethsemane he said stay awake and pray watch and pray lest you enter in to temptation and of course they failed to do that they fell asleep and so they were scattered when the soldiers came to arrest jesus what that tells us is this if i'm going to have victory in my life as a christian prayer is going to have to be a regular part of it not just at the moment when something happens a lot of times we fail to pray when there's an emergency because we don't pray normally but if we had a habit of prayer we would likely continue to pray you might say this our prayer life needs to have something other than break glass in case of emergencies only which sometimes some of us have it reminds me of that guy that is on the phone and he's calling he's calling an insurance company and they said can we help you and he says yeah do you insure houses they say oh of course he said well do you do fire insurance they said yes he said well i'd like to have some fire insurance they said well we have to send us pictures we'll have to come out look at the house he said well you better hurry it's on fire right now yeah that's not going to work put this understand your enemy peter is going to introduce us to our adversary uh in our text today he prowls about he calls him your adversary your enemy the devil prowls about like a roaring lion now these are familiar verses to us but we kind of take it for granted we hear a lot about the devil in church and in bible studies but how we really relate to the devil personally may be a little different than what we say we this is a fascinating thing that happened during world war one listen to this when world war one broke out the war ministry in london dispatched a coded message to one of the british outposts in the inaccessible areas of the message read war declared arrest all enemy aliens in your district the war ministry received this reply we've arrested ten germans six belgians four frenchmen two italians three austrians and an american please advise immediately who are we at war with yeah and i think sometimes the reality is that we claim we know who our enemy", "the bible's really clear we struggle not against flesh and blood our battle isn't against other human beings but we tend to actually not live that out oh no the problem i have is my husband or my wife it's my parents it's my boss it's whoever it is in your life you you actually think they are the problem and satan has been very good at uh using other people in your life and maybe he but if you think they're the enemy if you think your non-christian boss is an atheist is the enemy and not the prisoner of war you're already fighting the wrong enemy and so peter wants us to know we do have an enemy and he is in the spiritual realm and he does use other people by the way if you're not sure of that remember in the book of job that job claimed i'll get job to curse you god let me touch him remember let me take everything away you've blessed him no wonder you know he's kind of mercenary in love with you because you've given him so many blessings take him away let me take him away he'll curse you let me let me take his health away skin for skin he'll curse you that was remember satan boldly claimed before god god gave him some leash to do but not to and who is it it's not satan himself audibly speaking but job's wife to job why don't you curse god and die where do you think she got that idea you see you don't realize it but satan uses your mouth sometimes if you're not sure of that go into the gospels and see where peter has to be rebuked by jesus get behind me satan where's he he's coming out of your mouth right now peter we don't even realize it ourselves that satan can use our mouths or our wife's mouth or our boss's mouth but it's satan who's the enemy we need to realize that we need to understand our enemy paul says as much in the new testament to the corinthians we are not ignorant he says of satan's devices the fact is too often we are what was he talking about there forgiving the guy who had repented first they didn't want to kick him out and then they kicked him out and didn't want to let him come back in when he had repented he says we need to forgive we're not that's one of the things satan's doing in your life if you're not forgiving somebody that needs and is ready to be forgiven but it's interesting that", "it describes satan as a roaring lion see the problem we have with the devil what we need to remember where his weapons come from are just like a lion a roaring lion there are two primary weapons that satan uses in your life whether you believe it or not one is deception he's the father of lies john 8. when he speaks he lies he's a good liar i don't mean he's good i mean he's good lion he knows how to lie really well and not just lying fear fear he wants to create through deception fear in your life because if he can cause you to be afraid he can control you even if you're a christian he can't possess you but he can affect your decisions and your thinking and you can give ground to him and many times we don't see how that's already happening put this down determine to withstand him that's what we're told in our text in your faith if you go through the armor of god many of you have studied it or studied it with me in ephesians 6 you discovered that from head to toe you're covered in armor right and most of it's defensive you have one piece of armor that's the sword of the spirit but the rest of it really is to protect its protective clothing or like a soldier wears to protect you against an attack but it's been pointed out repeatedly by many and rightly so there is no real piece of for the back because it's never god's intention that you would run from the devil's attack instead it's equipment to resist the devil's attack jot down in ephesians 6 and verse where he says therefore take up the full armor that you may be able not to run but to resist in the evil day having done everything you know um i read an article i don't know that i'll ever need this article i don't even know who writes articles like this it was about how to survive a lion yeah you can get them in his i don't know who writes that like some experts these things seem so obvious but maybe not so i'll just mention them in case you are ever being attacked by a lion i thought it was a joke too when i read it's like are they serious yes that's step one okay well we're not we already got a problem i just how how does okay don't two don't run now i know biblically we get it but not so easy to do they're just they're not this is not a", "christian writing this by the way stand your ground they said if you run they'll send your fear and they'll chase you then remain standing is a part of what they're saying they said don't don't crouch down they said this the line will likely go for your face and throat well thanks for that now you're gonna before you're telling that before i do the don't panic part this means it will jump and you'll have full view of the giant cat while this sounds terrifying it will help to have a good view of the animal that's what i needed because i want to remember what killed me if you were to crouch down you would have much less of a chance to fight back at that angle shout as loudly as possible raise your hands again truly yell from the depths of your hopefully you've eaten something the fight back the cat is likely to be much stronger than you you think but hitting it in the head and the eyes will have a great impact and could turn the lion off of his attack on you thinking who writes you you hit them as hard as you can here's here's a you know what um multi-course meal one there's two and you think i mean really it sounds almost ludicrous but it's interesting if you want advice how to actually handle a real lion attack it's very similar to what peter is telling us here running is not the way to free yourself that's not going to work you need to stand your ground you need to fight back and you need to not allow yourself to be filled with fear put this down don't run but run towards the roar interesting thing about lions of the jungle as they age they can lose their teeth i found some pictures of lions of teeth as they get older and they also lose their ability to run fast they can't run like they used to in fact the young lionesses can way outrun them and many times they struggle with arthritis in fact there's two zoos that i was reading about in in our nation right now who've had to euthanize lions because of horrible arthritis in their male lions very interesting they can still move about but they don't move very fast and of course if they can't hunt successfully they will die so an interesting thing happens with lions because while they can't run or hunt the way they used to what they never lose is their roar a lion's roar can be heard especially out in the jungles up to five miles away", "about 114 decibels it's deafening it is frightening you can imagine unless you're in a safe place where you're it can be terrifying to anything and anybody who's anywhere near it including humans and so it's interesting peter your enemy is the devil he's looking and he's gonna roar at you but you're gonna have to resist all the fear that comes into you and so it's been said that one technique older lions have sometimes is they will in their pride they'll have these young lionesses who are very spry and powerful and fast and actually the lionesses do the real hunting and the old lion will go down to one end of the savannah crouch down the young lionesses on the other end crouch down and they will wait for that roar that male lion will then roar with that sound that terrifies everything in between them and every animal will run of course away from the roar right into the mouths of the young lions who will absolutely take him down and of course the only wise thing to do if you could tell those animals although you can't would be actually you need to run toward the lion because you can get away from the line you can't get away from the other and that principle is true for us when we're terrified when things are happening the instinctively we want to run away in unbelief but we run right into the enemy's trap when we do that we need to learn to run towards the roar and i think of david little david he's just a shepherd boy who comes just to deliver some food to the army where his brothers are out fighting remember they're fighting the philistines down in the valley of elah and his dad has sent him on this mission just drop off some food see how your brothers are doing hopefully they're doing okay you remember what he found he found that the army of israel had been stalemated for as some giant goliath of the philistines this massive man would come out and he would say come on out one guy against one of them just me see who's gonna we'll decide this battle today this war we don't need everybody to fight just who wants to fight me who wanted to fight him nobody what does it say they did they ran every day he came out they were terrified david couldn't understand that and so he was asking what happens to the person who kills the guy what do you get and think well you're married to the king's daughter and no taxes like well", "i'm kind of interested little kid nobody was interested enough that they they actually said to saul hey there's some crazy kid out here you might want to talk to him i don't know what they said but they reported it to saul saul calls them if you remember the story and saul's like how in the world you're just a little boy well as a matter of fact i may be a little boy but there was a bear that came to my father's sheep there was a lion that came in and when that lion came in to grab the sheep i grabbed it by the beard of his chinny chin chin and i smote him so you know i know something about taking on lions philistine this uncircumcised philistine will be just like the bear and the lion i know how to handle this kind of a threat i didn't run away from him and i won't run away from him and what does the bible say when goliath and david meet goliath mocked him i'm going to kill you today i'm going to feed you to the birds of the air terrifying stuff giant man little boy and what does little david say actually it's going to go the other way around your promise with me the great lion killer your problem is that you have defied the god of israel you come to me with the sword and the spirit of javelin and i come to you in the mighty name of the lord of hosts the lord of armies you don't got a chance yes someone's going to get fed to the birds that it ain't me it's you and he then ran into the battle very interesting exactly what we're told in scripture we ought to do and just the of what we tend to do jot down james 4 and verse 7 james talks about this same idea he says submit therefore to god it's where it has to start resist the devil and he will flee from you before you can before satan you're going to have to bow i think of jesus after he was baptized was lead driven the bible says out into to be tempted of the devil and he was there for 40 days and 40 nights fasting and praying and the bible says satan then came to remember turn these stones if you are claim to be if you are what you heard god say there at the baptism remember god had said this is my beloved son it's a statement satan's always in the business of putting a question mark", "where god puts a period just like he did in the garden if you are the son of god turn these stones into bread you know feed yourself it's interesting because satan repeatedly comes at jesus when he's in a weakened state and what does jesus do does he run oh no he gives satan a bible study he brings the word of god repeatedly out to him our very offensive weapon he withstands him strong in the faith that's what the word of god does the word of god builds up your faith please don't get the idea quoting verses at the that's not some christians think oh some kind of weird spiritual thing if you quote a verse the devil goes oh i can't handle the bible listen the devil will quote the bible to you but he'll twist the word of god he is a master at the word of god don't think that's going to hurt his ears it's not the words of the bible that affect him it's your faith that is built up by you knowing and believing the word of god amen you need to know the word of god that applies to your situation so that you can defend yourself build yourself up in the faith and stand firm so satan says this isn't working if every time he attacks you you strengthen your faith if every time he attacks you like one brother says every time he attacks me to lust i just pray for 10 other guys who i know struggle every time he attacks me with a temptation to gossip i just start praising god for the people and talking about how wonderful they are in other words if every time he attacks you resist by strengthening your faith and expressing your faith satan will realize this is not going to work i'm out of here it's the devil who finally leaves jesus not jesus who leaves the devil in the wilderness and so we need to learn how to do battle against our enemy put this down don't oh this is i've already given you that one sorry but uh jot down philippians 1 and verse now this is an important part of this passage that i don't want you to miss in the midst of talking about spiritual warfare because it seems out of context but look again at verse 9 he says resist him firm in your faith but then he says something that will encourage you knowing the same experiences of suffering are being accomplished by your brethren who the world very interesting to me philippians chapter 1 and verse 27", "paul says this only be sure to lead your lives in a manner that will be worthy of the gospel of christ so that whether i do come and see you or remain absent i will hear about you listen that you are standing firm in one spirit and one purpose with one mind striving side by side as if in combat for the faith of the gospel that's the amplified version see one of the lies the devil tells you when you're going through your tragedy your difficulty is you are all suffering tends to isolate us emotionally mentally we feel very alone we struggle with telling anybody maybe we genuinely don't want to be a burden to somebody or maybe we're ashamed of what we're going through or our unbelief or our fear whatever it is that's the way it is many times when we suffer satan wants us to think we're alone and we tend to want to isolate don't want to get involved with anybody else maybe i don't want to go to church today rather watch it online if at all that is a lie that satan tells us that we're the only ones going through this remember elijah had this great moment of up on mount carmel the real god baal or jehovah will answer by fire and you remember how that came out first kings 18 and we all know god moved by fire and everybody the people were amazed and it was seemed like a great victory they killed the prophets of baal it was a good day but it was right after that the queen queen jezebel those were her prophets said yeah you're going to be just as dead as them when i get my hands on you and you know it's just interesting but though he could stand before these prophets because stand before all the unbelief of of the nation elijah really struggled with the queen's statements about him that that she was going to kill him so what does he do he runs he runs actually goes down to a puts himself outside of her political territory goes down under a tree and just says i want to die he feels like a total failure and he's angry he literally says god please take he's giving up on on the ministry and then god says you know we need to talk come on out to mount sinai and so he gives them some supernatural strength brings them out to mount sinai where god meets with him it's very interesting because god says repeatedly to him elijah what are you doing here and i've always found that interesting", "because god told him to go it's like well you told me to come no that's not what the point is why are you struggling so much why do you want to die why do you want to give up i want to use you there's more to your life and there are times in your life you feel like my life is over i don't want to live anymore god says i'm not done with you what was the problem with elijah he felt like he had been faithful he had he had been faithful to honor the lord but he was the only one in all of israel do you remember that i alone everybody else is yeah they claimed up on the mountain the jehovah's god but they don't really believe and now ladies trying to kill me i call it the elijah syndrome i spell it s-i-n-d-r-o-m-e because we can all we can all fall into that when we're suffering we feel like it's just not fair why me no one else is and god says elijah you're wrong there are seven thousand that have not bowed the knee to bail you're wrong there are others suffering right now in utica new york there is a museum that that have that hold uh titles for all over the from history being the fastest and the longest runners the bible has something like that but it's not about running a physical race it's hebrews 11 and hebrews 12. in other words look at all these who have run the race and they're now in the stands who have successfully had problems greater than most of us but have by faith walk through them they're surrounding you they're shouting at you you can do this we did it and this is what peter is saying here shot down ecclesiastes 4 12 when it comes to battling an enemy ecclesiastes 4 12 if one can overpower him who is alone two can resist him you weren't called to fight satan by yourself put this down letter b stand strong in god's grace put in the word strong and grace and look at verse 10. he says after you have suffered for a little while somebody how little is the while well paul says for momentary light affliction is producing for us an eternal weight of glory everything has to be measured against eternity ah could be the rest of my life it could be so it's all about perspective but he says to those that are gonna suffer it's just a little while after you suffered the god you might want to underline this the god of all", "who called you to his eternal glory in christ will himself perfect confirm you put this down you start with god's grace and you end with god's glory very interesting that's what he says he called you to his eternal glory but he's the god of all grace psalm 84 11 a great verse says for the lord god is a son and a shield the lord gives grace no good thing does he withhold from him who walks uprightly in romans 5 verses 1 and 2 it talks about the importance of grace paul says this it's just pure doctrine therefore having been justified by faith declared righteous by faith we now have peace with god through our lord jesus christ through whom also listen to this we have obtained our introduction into by faith into this grace in which we stand and we exult in the hope of the glory of god so we have god's calling on us which is by grace but his calling to our destiny going to be glory but in between the time that we're called to follow the lord and our call to heaven the focus really here is on god being the god of all grace now why is that such a key because peter was an expert on falling go back and read his story written for all eternity in the gospels and you will find all through all four of the gospels but i think especially in the gospel of mark references to peter's failure we know that he said though all these forsake you i will never do that somehow i'm a cut certainly fell into doubt when he was at first walking on the sea of galilee and started to sink in unbelief he fell asleep in the garden of gethsemane and he fell into total denial of jesus in the courtyard he's kind of the regular fall guy all through basically i believe what peter is saying to people is you're all aware of my feelings but i am proof that god is and i think this is incredibly important for us to understand how can god help me to be encouraged in the midst of my verse 10 is a key to this whole passage that god is the god of all grace i don't think anybody knew that better than peter that's one of the reasons i think we all kind of like peter john's amazing in his writings john is the called john the beloved he's really the beloved of jesus he's the one whom jesus loved that's why he's uh i think peter is more beloved by most", "of us because we can relate more to peter than we can john he peter was clearly a spiritual leader he's listed first in all the lists of the apostles but while he was a spiritual leader he was also at times a spiritual loser and yet god used him jesus said to peter follow me but peter will follow him at a distance after jesus is arrested jesus said walk on water peter sank peter said there in matthew 16 you are the christ the son of the living god but then he argued with jesus anyway about him going to the cross jesus told peter and james and john stay awake he fell asleep and then up on the mount of transfiguration it's funny because you jesus told the disciples i'm going to jerusalem and i'm going to suffer and die what did peter do he rebuked jesus the next verse jesus rebuked peter the next passage threw up on the mount of transfiguration and now the father is about hanging out here on the mountain with moses elijah and jesus as though they're all equals and you should just stay on the mountain that is not my plan this is my beloved son listen to him and and and mark he said i just i didn't know what to say so i just said something you know peter was one like some of us we open our mouth and our minds are racing and we slip the clutch and just blurt out whatever comes out of our mouth and we say man there's a man after my own flesh you peter failed really at every point but he gets used mightily even after all of his failings because he did come to understand something every one of us in i keep meaning to understand it too it's not our capability that god's going to be glorified by it'll be our teachability and our humility when we have failed there are lessons to learn from our failures that will give us the ability like peter is to speak with authority to other people to say listen i know what i'm talking about you need the grace of god but god can strengthen you why because my life is a testimony of doing just that i am proof that god is i don't care how long you've been a christian i don't care how much you've done what you do you're going to make i got a text on the way to church today from the media department and from the folks in the control room hey there's something wrong here the title on the background says stand", "but uh on the outline that says stand in wha uh what's up because that doesn't normally happen my son who i had texted the stand in grace title two sent me a screenshot letting me know i had sent that to him they said which which is it i said yes not because we couldn't have changed but because those two are the same thing you want to stand in victory i do but it won't be because you never make it is the grace of god ask paul talking to the elders of ephesus last words after three years i commend you to the word of god's grace that will be able to build you up you will never outlive outmature the need again and again and again in little things and big things for the grace of god i heard years ago of an ancient sepulcher a tomb that was discovered and it had a headstone there was only one word on the tombstone not the person's name not when they lived or died no titles of their life like we are so often to see in cemeteries just one word can i tell you something if god is going to use you in a great way then it's going to be in part because you are very aware of how much he has and you still are in need of it don't think you can somehow get beyond that and expect to god use can use you because peter will be used and is being used because of his failings and in spite of his failings because of the healing that has happened because of the lord you start with god's grace you end glory put this down the answer to my current suffering is his complete but in the word complete look at verse and don't detach it from the rest of the he's talking about how god after you've suffered will perfect confirm strength and establish you and then he says to him be dominion forever and ever that god is gracious is a lesson i need to learn if i'm going to be victorious and used by god but that god is governing is key you've often heard me say when it comes to why am i thankful why should we be thankful we should at all times be thankful of course but there are three reasons that i uniquely think should encourage every heart to be thankful i call them the three r's of rejoicing you've heard me say it number one christ is risen from the dead what does that mean it means that he is", "taking care of my failings in the past all of them are forgiven and he rose to say it is finished here's proof first r he is risen second r is that he is ruling the third r is that he is returning his returning is my answer for the fog i have about what's going to happen in the future i know what the future is he's written the book it's at the end of the book i could not i could know where i'm going i could know what he's going to do but it's that middle one that he is reigning right now that's what that verse is talking about that's the answer for my fears that i have in the present many of you are alive some of you are i have noticed that if you have not lived through a national tragedy and i'm the same way it is just something in it's something of history um i was trying to watch a 911 documentary with my grandchildren the other day and it was hard for me to my five-year-old grandson was i was explaining to him what happened and i was uh he didn't know it but i was just kind of on the edge of emotion and i was describing to him what happened as we were seeing pictures of it about these planes and these men and that people died in those buildings and jumped to their death and you know he's five i'm i mean obviously he doesn't quite understand how profound that day was and how etched it is in our many of our hearts so many of us who have digital watches and clocks for years when when it says 9 11 we can't help but think about that day and it'll be that way probably for the rest of our lives not so for a generation that didn't experience it he kept saying well when it when's that going to happen when's out of there when's the when is building going to fall down when are the people going to be f he wanted to see it like it was a tv show you know some action thing and i he's just too young he didn't live through it i didn't live through world war ii i did not live through pearl harbor i don't have those memories those are history to me but in 1963 when i was just in first grade i'll never forget the lunch lady running through the campus at bradford elementary there in placentia screaming the president's been shot the president's been shot and they put us on", "buses and they sent us home and i remember every i was glued to our little black and white portable tv wondering what's happening what does this mean and is this the beginning just like on 9 11 for many of you here who didn't live through that other tragedy what's going to happen next are we about to be invaded by by russia we've been we were concerned about all of us at that time that there was going to be a nuclear showdown between ashland russia this guy that that killed john f kennedy was he he had defected to russia at some point he had some all kinds of wondering and will they kill the vice president will they who's next just like after 9 11 what's next we all felt it now why do i tell you that because that is the human nature when things are out of control is to freak out and to fear what might happen i tell you that because there's some sense in that that i have that in isaiah when he says in the king year king uzziah died i saw the lord you need to know that that king other than one other guy who ruled for a couple more years kenya's eye was a pretty good king and he ruled now i don't care which party you're in favor of i don't know that we'd like anybody to be in the presidency for 52 years really but when he died that was a time of national freak out like what's going to happen now now we're weak and now who's going to take over what will it mean it's in the year that there's a death and the question is what's going to happen next that he sees while the throne of israel is vacant the throne of heaven is not i saw the lord high lifted up sitting on a throne that's exactly why you need to think about this when you read the book of revelation and john in his old age is exiled banished from the body of christ the only living apostle that's left to a rock island called patmos it was a prison island because the emperor of the roman empire had decreed domitian that's where you're gonna go and no doubt that's where you're gonna die do you remember what happened on the island of patmos in chapter four of that book revelation i heard a voice saying come up here and i was caught up and he sees heaven john sees heaven what's the first thing that he sees a throne and by the way somebody is", "sitting on that throne and he's the one who's in charge within a year domitian will be dead and john will be back in ephesus ministering the gospel listen your god is in charge of your universe this is what peter's saying don't ever forget it to him be the dominion you're going to go through some stuff but what does the old hymn say every joy or trial falleth from above traced upon our dial by the god of love god's looking at you he'll decide just like he did with job what can you handle will it seem like more than you can handle of course it will why because it's designed to stretch and grow and refine your he's not just trying to get you through it he's bringing you into the likeness of christ who is perfected through sufferings so the idea here is oh don't forget that he is on the throne the reason many years ago this changed for me i don't worry about who sits in the white house is because i know who's gonna sit on the white throne i know the one who's gonna ride the white horse and i know the one who's handing out the white robes and by the way i already got mine and it fits perfectly and one's available for you as jot this down letter c stand together with god's people if you want to stand in victory this is the only way it happens put in the words together and people at the end of this epistle listen to what he says through sylvanus you might jot down next to that name silas a little more familiar to you our faithful brother so i regard him i have written to you briefly exhorting and testifying that this is the true grace of god stand firm in it she who is in babylon chosen together with you said your greetings and so does my son mark put this down don't underestimate your never ending need for grace he comes back to that subject pastor chuck that reminded us as pastors so often of what paul wrote to the churches in galatia this is galatians 3 3 having begun by the spirit would you be perfected by the flesh in other words the tendency at the beginning of your christian life is to say amazing grace that saved me i can't believe it's not my works it's what jesus has done i accept that i'm so grateful but then the tendency is to move away from that awareness into thinking that god is going to accept me and approve me because of my performance", "40 years ago i heard this preacher give this illustration and it registered for me because i'm a child of the 60s and and uh in 1958 a guy named eric bran actually was on the ed sullivan show some of you will remember this because he was on there more than once because that was only one and i remember the show so he must have had him on be beyond that uh he was a plate spinner how many of you have ever seen a plate i haven't seen any lately that's fine but uh back then that was a big deal and he would get up on the stage and he would make these plates spin and then he'd take another like stick four foot stick and get it going and then he had plates and literally he would start a couple go start another one and these other ones remember would start to wobble and they look like how are they they're about to fall off and so you'd be really involved you'd be saying you know go go back and get it going this is national tv don't let it follow you and you're the audience is totally involved but he did that i really even wait till it's just about go up there and get going again and then he would start a couple more pretty soon they're just the stages full of all these plates wobbling he's running around doing all this stuff and this preacher said that is exactly a great picture of the church of jesus he said somebody receives christ and we they say well how are you doing with uh studying the bible i'm supposed to be saying about yes you should be studying the bible it's really important for your faith okay i'm going to start studying the bible starting the bible they come studying the bible what about your prayer life whoa pray life okay prayer life saying the bible study they come back to the next high growth studying and prayer of them what happened sharing your faith you know one thing after another just being added and overwhelmed running around and really moving out of that relationship of grace with the lord you never outgrow that we always need to come back with that the bottom line is when you as a christian when you scale the last spiritual mountain of your life and you're victorious in battle don't forget to say jot it down first corinthians 15 listen to what paul says but by the grace of god i am what i am and his grace toward me did not prove", "vain but i labored even more than all of them yet not i but the grace of god in me and our last fill in see you can't stand anymore put in the word alone on the day of pentecost as you read acts the new covenant jeremiah spoke of that god promised came about the comforter the paracletos the helper that jesus promised it's to your advantage that i go away if i don't go away he won't be sent the holy spirit was poured out and uh proving that jesus was at the right hand of the father and if you read there in the book of acts i believe there are four miracles that happen on the day of pentecost but many times one of them there was a mighty rushing wind or the sound of it anyway we don't hear that everybody's hair was blowing it was just the sound of wind something coming over from this upper room we know that there appeared tons of fire above the heads of the 120 that had gathered that was a miracle we know of course they spoke in other languages they had never studied glossalia speaking in tongues happened just as jesus said in mark 16 they will speak in other tongues these signs will accompany them who believe those are all but the one that i think too often is missed is mentioned in acts 2 and verse 14 it's this one it just says but peter taking his stand what are those next three words read them out loud eleven you see that sound like a miracle oh it was because until the holy spirit comes in his life that doesn't happen peter is always on his own doing his own thing he is somebody who doesn't need anybody else you see look at verse 9 again of our text in verse 9 he says at the end knowing the same experiences of sufferings are being accomplished by your brethren in other words peter says to the suffering don't you realize you need to know there are other people that are suffering you need people in your life to help you with yours and now at the end of the peter basically says i'm not alone now i'm a person who also has people in my life right now this moment going through the trials that i'm going to face remember he's toward the end of his life sylvanus is probably silas that's what most believe he is the one that went when they were arrested and thrown into the philippian jail he is probably the one who appears to have written this you", "say well i thought peter wrote it peter probably did not write first peter though he is the author of everything in it silvanus was his secretary you might say the greek in first peter is amazing compared to what they think a fisherman would have known and second peter is much more likely written by peter it's a different style but the message comes from peter and so here we have this guy who he calls a faithful brother he's the one who seems to always be in the shadow of somebody greater both with paul it's paul and silas and it's peter and he's my secretary but god used silas in a big way by the way silas was a prophet himself in the church of antioch so he had great gifts but he is kind of taking a a shadowed position and then he mentions her it's a feminine uh noun that she is the elect with me sends greetings here in babylon um some believe that peter was actually in physically babylon i don't we have no church tradition or history at all that puts him ever in babylon so it's much more likely i believe that he was in rome where church tradition does put him and where he does die and it is in the book of revelation that we read about mystery babylon connected with rome so it's quite possible peter is referring to rome but didn't want to write that word should this epistle be found by the romans it would not go well for him perhaps that's true and then we have that this mention of he calls him my son this is believed to be and i think it's probably the case peter's not biological son but his son in the faith just like timothy was paul's son in the faith but this is an important guy though he just has his name there mark is uh no doubt john mark the one who was barnabas cousin who remember went with paul and deserted paul on the first missionary journey barnabas picks him up and encourages him and by the end of paul's ministry john mark has a lot of value he is probably the one who was brought to faith by peter and also the author of of mark very aware of peter's failings as the gospel of mark describes it so very very interesting to me because here is peter encouraging people in relationship the very one who frankly didn't seem to have too much of a concern for that in the gospels just briefly look with me at a couple of", "verses through the book chapter 1 verse 22. listen to what peter wrote there since you have an obedience to the truth purified your souls for a sincere love of the brethren fervently love one another from the heart look at chapter 2 and verse 17 honor all people the brotherhood chapter 3 verse 8 to sum up all of you be harmonious sympathetic brotherly kind-hearted and humble in spirit chapter 4 verses 8 through 10 above all keep fervent in your love for one another and he goes on in other words all through this book this man who solo for jesus god a guy is a different it's like i am encouraging you and your relationships with one another and by here at the end of my life i know more than ever i need the people of god's family around me i want to encourage you as well to consider getting involved whether it's the engagement project or one of the other fellowships and ministries we have women's bible studies we have men's bible studies god calls us there's power in unity there's protection in unity there's purpose and unity but you need to see that unity is there is no unity outside of community it doesn't exist so if you want to experience all that god has for you and the resources that god has for you to stand in victory you're going to realize i have to do that with god's people and then the last couple verses greet one another with a kiss of love i'll leave you to figure out how to do that men kissed men women kiss women by the way there was no snow going on this was going to work great okay peace be to you all who notice are in christ that's interesting peace to all of you who are in christ every single human being and every person in this room are watching were born with a that you will only find when you are in christ so my question for you is are you really in christ you say well i'm in church there's a huge difference many come to church who have never come to christ you can be in church and thinking that you're in christ because you're in church would be like thinking you're an athlete because you have or you're a cop because you like krispy kreme or something those don't it doesn't work that way um the bible says in colossians that coming to christ is a moving i'm not talking about emotions the bible says he has moved us from the domain of darkness and he has transferred us into", "the kingdom of god's beloved son if you've come to christ god has moved you if that transfer has never happened in your life the bible says you're not in christ there is no peace except for those who are in christ it's your birthright now whether you're experiencing it or not it has to do with your faith believing romans 5 1 and 2 is and philippians 4 6 through 8 whether you're praying and trusting and thanking him those are things we have you can possess something and not enjoy it but you can't possess it unless you come to christ let's pray father i do get excited about these things but i don't want to be excited if i'm not an example of it lord once again today you have reminded me not just theologically and doctrinally and biblically but personally that i need that i need your grace so lord i pray though that it's hard to fail people and hurt people lord he gives me an opportunity to say i'm sorry forgive me and to get my eyes on you and not me and to get their eyes on you too so lord would you fill us with wisdom to how to stand against the devil not fight the wrong enemy lord would you give us the ability to realize that we will suffer but you will restore us you will heal us you will use it to make us stronger and it will be part of our testimony and then i pray you would use our failings on our weakness just as you always have to glorify yourself as the god of all grace help us to stand in grace and to stand in victory in jesus name amen can we stand together and sing my prayer is that if you're hearing you're going through a tough time that the enemy won't be able to deceive you anymore about where the source of your adversary who that is come to the prayer room if you say i need some help i need some people that can pray with me that's what they're waiting to do they're waiting to go to battle for you it's what we do with the armor of god go read ephesians 6 18 when you get the armor all on you go to battle for somebody else you pray for others encourage you to come get some prayer wednesday night we'll finish praise god it just happens to be this sunday wednesday we'll finish the book of leviticus and not that we need to celebrate finishing it but i it's a unique message on how to dedicate", "yourself your family what you have to it's a fascinating study i want you to come wednesday night and maybe you've never come come for this one and then consider going on into numbers with us but i pray that god will build you up in your faith strengthen you so you can stand in grace and stand in victory god bless you the lord and spirit and truth here this we've got a brand new song i saw singing i saw darkness but the miracle that i just can't get this is my testimony from death is my testimony if i'm not dead then you're not done greater things are still to come if i'm not dead and you're not done greater things are still to come this is my testimony screams fear of my story i'll what's going on only you deserve to never runs out on me amen that is a truth that we can sing and know that it is 100 true even when like singing it uh that's jason that sang that song by the way i texted him last night i don't know like eight o'clock i was like hey could you sing the song tomorrow my voice is just not having it right now and he's like yeah sure i'll do that and then he does it better than i would have done anyway so that's great there's a lot of new faces that i see out here and then for you there's probably some new faces that you see up and god is just increasing uh the talent in our church and he's increasing the availability of people to serve and so jason is one of those people that's andre back there in the coved cage that's that's todd he's uh he's back there so all these new folks that are joining the team his kids are actually leading worship up at the youth as well and so just a musical family and then you know casey and cindy and moses and kaylee we are kind of knit together by our love for music but we're knit together by something more than that and that's our for christ and then he's increasing he's increasing our love for one another and uh one way he does that is on thursday nights we get together and we rehearse and so we rehearse the songs but we always set apart 30 minutes to spend with the lord without instruments without music and we get together we pray for one another we dive into the word a little bit and uh we make fun of one another it's a really", "he brings us along as more than just people who are in the same vicinity as each other but he brings us together to really worship him in unity and i consider them my brothers and sisters and you know i consider you my family you know we're all family but the thing is you're more like the weird like that i don't really know too well but i would like to get to know better you know who wouldn't and uh and these are my brothers and sisters i said that joke last time and people were i would never say that but you know i have a microphone so and and so the the difference between someone who just shows up and you kind of know and somebody who's you're really doing life with is you just spend more and you go a little bit deeper maybe you go a little bit smaller i mean i love that there's hundreds of us here today worshiping the lord in spirit and truth but we can't all know each other on a deep level you know sometimes you just need a small group to do that and so we have something that's starting up here very soon it's called the engagement project it goes for about 10 weeks it's this wonderful program uh from dell tackett he did the truth project now he's doing the engagement project and some of you may be like well i'm not ready to get married so it's not even has nothing to do with marriage i know uh some people have been like is that only for married couples or no no it's to engage the culture around you it's a it's it's an opportunity to get together deepen your roots with your church and then inspire each other reach those around you with the gospel not just like a one and done like hey god loves you has a plan for your life but to really engage the culture with the gospel and so it's a great opportunity to to learn that but then to also grow deeper into your roots and turn someone from a weird uncle to a beloved brother or and so if you would like to do that you begin this journey i think there's about 120 people that are in in the groups right now i would love to see 1200 people in groups just all over meeting all over learning to engage the culture and so take advantage of that if you have the opportunity we're going to commit our time to the lord we have a baby dedication that's", "coming up which is always a blessing to see and then we're going to receive our morning tithes and offerings and then we're going to dive into god's word together my son on every thursday morning quizzes me he quizzes me on the lesson that he and i was like i didn't learn a lesson i should be quizzing you maybe he thinks that i learned a lesson too and so he asked me on thursday morning he said dad is it better to follow your heart and i said well i think it's better to follow jesus he says you are correct then he goes deeper and he says is it to follow your heart and i said honestly i think it's easier to follow your heart he goes you are he said but you know but we need to and i said that's that's pretty profound theology there son and that applies to what we're doing and what we're about to do now but god wants our heart but we need to worship him twofold spirit you know with all of our heart but also in truth and sometimes our heart isn't there yet sometimes our heart we don't feel like worshiping him but we don't worship him out of our feelings we worship him out of the truth amen and then hopefully our and so he wants to sanctify us he wants to transform us from one degree of glory to the next degree of glory and so as we're here this morning maybe you've sung that song that we're just saying his love never fails never gives up never runs out i would rather sing about the truth of god's love toward me than how i feel about him because he feels perfectly about me he loves me perfectly i am loving him imperfectly and then we sing this is my testimony muck it up with stories of our past we we said no this is our testimony that i've been by grace because of jesus and so if we can sing these truths if we believe these truths our heart will start to follow after that we can begin to worship him in spirit and truth and so let's continue to sing there's a link that'll pop up on the screen if you are led to give if that's the way you want to honor the lord here this morning if you're watching online you can see it there's agape boxes on the wall as we leave and then we're going to sing one more song so let's sing let's pray first lover so thankful to be here and we're grateful that", "grace rewrote our story and so we want to testify to that not our own works that we could boast but because of you because of the cross this is the empty tomb and so we want to honor you as we sing hosanna when it was first sung maybe it meant it was a plea for you to save now but now we can sing hosanna and say that is the god who saves we know who saves and so we love you look forward to worshiping you in jesus name amen nothing was spared to prove your love there's never a heart beyond your are the one that we are welcoming you can be seated let's have you guys come and bring their son for dedication ian and laura's son what a good name let's pray father we do ask for this little guy that i'm holding sweet little the plan that you have the good works that are ahead for him lord to come to know you personally is always our prayer and it says mom and dad's prayer too but we pray for them that they would know how to raise him according to who he is uniquely but in the fear and the admonition the instruction of god in that it wouldn't just be bible studies in church in sunday school but lord the testimony that they have and a family that loves him we ask that he would become everything that his name implies to be courageous in the things of the kingdom of god and courageous for christ so bless his life use him for your glory we dedicate him completely to you in jesus now we are giving you a bible for him you'll read it to him and certificate of dedication thank you guys as a family for coming up let's thank lord for them doing today doing well glad you are here in the house of god online we are glad you are here and i today uh they all centered around our four values that you would know god grow in god serve him and share him and today i have a list of things i want you to know about so number one uh on your way in you should be carrying your bible but also you should have been handed a bulletin and i want to encourage you to open up that bulletin real quick because there's an insert in there for blast fest and what bless fest is is our thanksgiving outreach where we reach out to those experiencing homelessness in the orange county area we bring people in and shelters and we come here and", "bless them with a whole day of where we serve them and one of the things we do is we give them clothing and this is a list of things that we want oop that is now on the ground of things that we want you to donate so we can give to them on that day so the serving doesn't only start on thanksgiving it starts right now and the list of things includes underwear new only socks new only shoes no sandals gloves clean pants etc so take a look at these inserts or there's things that you would like to

already almost thanksgiving so excited for bless fest we also have a ministry called divorce care and it's a ministry that is a 13-week class giving hope and healing to widows and widowers separated and divorced people it starts on thursday september 8th but description about not only what it is but what the heart is i want to encourage you to check out our highlights i want to in a way highlight the highlights that pastor bob has made for us on our website and our app if you go on there he's made a video he's literally filmed about like 10 videos of different ministries and events that he sees are really important for us to know about and potentially be involved in so he takes a couple minutes or a minute or so to describe the heart behind it what it looks like what's going to happen including divorce care and many other ministries i want to encourage you check out the highlights they're really a great resource pastor bob has poured his time and energy into it and i encourage you to check out the highlights so highlight the highlights all right we also have a sod or a school of discipleship it starts on september 11th it's eight weeks of classes and it happens on sunday afternoons if you want that online or on our app and there's a variety of classes you can find a little flyer out at the table in the courtyard also on our app um i would encourage you to be a part of it it's really a great way to equip yourself to know god's word better to make it known better as well do that on the app and i want to as we've been talking a lot about um", "home bible studies i want to invite you to pastor bob's home bible study wednesday night service because it started his home originally actually so it's pretty cool um that's pretty cool and i want to encourage you guys to come out to his home bible study we have it on 7 p.m we call it next step and we consider it the next step for you to grow in god's body here at cabbage shop waste anaheim and we even serve dinner before it even starts at 5 00 5 30. if you want to find out what that dinner is you can text ccea to 59769 and we'll let you know what that dinner is or five nine seven six nine and you'll get the info on what it is and then we start uh service at seven o'clock there's worship there's bible study there is also youth ministry children's ministry and spanish ministry but it's not a small small group but it's a smaller group than this and it's a great way to plug in to god's body here at calvary chapel east anaheim so thank you so much for your time and now on to god's you know the uh the value of being in the services each are unique of course first uh on sunday more people come we're glad for you to come bring friends that go to church on sunday and we're going through the word of god verse by verse wednesday night uh if you've never been we are also doing an old testament study uh like we do on sunday mornings only in the old testament looking for jesus christ in the midst of the old testament he's all he's the theme of the old testament so we're studying the book of leviticus we'll be fitting finishing that a book this wednesday night and then going on to numbers but besides the difference in what we're there are different environments smaller group of people on wednesday night but my heart as a pastor is that everybody would find themselves both in serving and in relationship and fellowship groups that are smaller that's why what raymond shared is so important to me um you know it's kind of like people say well should i come wednesday or should i go to one of those things on tuesday or thursday well you need to pray that through but if you've been here for years and you've never been in a smaller group than 350 adults on wednesday night maybe it's time for you to join one of those home bible studies i'll miss you but i think it might be better for you", "because we want you to be known now do i want everybody to leave wednesday night no but we'll make room for new people if you go my point is take advantage and consider what god might be calling you to do go on the app look what's going on there's a lot going on you need to be aware of it in the next two or three weeks i'd say we have eight or nine new ministries or ministries coming back and take time to check that out i'd like you to open your bibles for our last study in first peter first peter chapter five first peter five beginning in verse and we'll read to the end of the chapter peter said be spirit be on the alert your adversary the devil prowls about like a roaring lion he's looking for someone to devour but resist him firm in your faith knowing the same experiences of suffering are being accomplished by your brethren who are in then after you've suffered for a little while the god of all grace who called you to his eternal glory in christ he perfect confirm strengthen and establish you to him be dominion forever and ever through sylvanus peter says our faithful brother for so i regard him i have written to you briefly exhorting and testifying that this is the true grace of god stand firm in it she who is in babylon chosen together with you sends you greetings and so does my son mark greet one another with a kiss of love peace be to you all who are in let's pray father once again we come asking for a supernatural work believing by faith that you inspired this scripture through your holy spirit at the writing of of of peter through silvanus and now lord to our ears we ask that the holy spirit might illuminate what he's inspired to what we have as needs this morning lord you know us better than we know ourselves we are your sheep and you know well the condition of your flock so feed us lord that which we need call us closer to you help us to trust you for the trials the temptations were in and give us victory by grace in jesus name i pray amen you can be seated 1066 was the year it happened the by the duke of normandy and he had victory in that battle history tells us because of a secret weapon that was just introduced into which seems so mundane to us um of course the cavalry uh had for the first time in battle used something called a", "it's like a big whoop to most of us but until then that was not used in battle and it gave them a competitive edge to win because they could literally stand up and use their swords and they were victorious and i want to talk to you today about standing spiritually put this down on the top of your outline you need to see god's victory circle has we find many people in scripture who were greatly used of god but at one point in their life become well because of unbelief because of disobedience because of circumstances we think of elijah who was so discouraged he quit the ministry before he was done jonah we all know his story he dove into um after failing peter went back to fishing that was his old job before he was an apostle and in the new testament on the first missionary journey with paul was a man by the name of john mark who left that mission assignment and just bailed on it and yet in every single one of their cases that wasn't the end of their story and so we're going to talk a little bit because maybe you're here and you have seen brighter days for your christian life you've had a time where you're closer to the lord being used of god or you feel like you're struggling or you will and if not it's not right now it'll happen in the future so we're going to talk about this idea from peter to these first century christians who he said are already suffering and they're going to go through more now that's never a good message you're really having a hard life really a hard time and you realize yeah it's going to get worse what i had i just wanted this to go away it's always one of those things i sometimes kind of joke around with people like well what if these real difficult times you're in right now you're going to look back on and go man that was a lot easier well thanks that's a wonderful message right how discouraging is that but actually that was the message that peter gave to those suffering christians in the first century you're suffering persecution now i want you to learn how to handle that remember suffer like christ did he's our example walking his steps he was silent though he was reviled he didn't revile in return kept trusting god but then he says don't be surprised at the fiery ordeal that's coming upon you to test your faith in other words guess what it's going to get a lot worse", "and sometimes that may not be a pleasant message but you and i usually we we're grateful we don't know i just keep it up just keep it a secret i'd rather not know because i just start to worry about it but regardless of whether you're going through a hard time or you just know you will someday in the future we want to talk about how to stand in spiritual victory so put this down learn to stand firm in the faith stand firm in the faith let's go back and look at verse 8 and 9 again he says to those who had just said cast your anxiety on christ because he cares for you so pray and commit your problems to the lord be of sober spirit be on the alert in the midst of your anxiety your adversary the devil he is prowling about and he's looking for a victim like a roaring lion he's seeking someone to devour now this idea of being sober in spirit look back at chapter four and verse seven it's not the first time peter has brought it up chapter four verse seven of first peter the end of all things is near therefore be of sound judgment and sober spirit for the purpose of prayer so whenever you read about this spiritual sobriety it's not just talking about not drinking or getting drunk it's talking about being spiritually tuned in and he brings us back to the issue of prayer always back to my relationship with the lord am i committing my problems to the lord am i asking him for help my prayer life there's an old saying seven days without prayer makes and that's absolutely true if you're not feeling close to god the bible says draw near to god the bible says it is time to seek the lord that's prayer we we need to do business with god not just at church on sunday morning but throughout our lives jot down daniel 6 10. this verse is interesting it tells us something about the character of daniel who's a righteous man in the old testament who by the way was in a very godless culture in babylon he was in and he was so righteous that the other people that were in government hated him because god's blessing of exalting was exaltation was on him under and so they found a way they figured the only way they could get him was to to make it against the law to pray that was the only way they could charge him with anything is that make what he does all the time against the law", "and on pain of death wasn't just you shouldn't do it you're going to get a ticket oh no you're going to die if we catch you doing it so here's what the bible says happened when he heard that the law was signed now when daniel knew that the document the law was signed he entered his house and then we're told now in his roof chamber he had windows open toward jerusalem and he continued kneeling on his knees three times a day praying and giving thanks sounds like philippians 4 7 to me before his god as he had been doing previously don't miss how do you handle the emergency it really matters how you were living before that remember when jesus came down from the mount of transfiguration there's a man whose son is demon possessed the disciples down below were trying to cast out the demon they couldn't do it jesus comes up and handles it the disciples said hey how come we can do it they'd cast out demons before and jesus said this kind only comes out by some say prayer and fasting some texts just say prayer we'll just leave it at that they both say prayer this kind only comes out by prayer it's like well how my sponsors know what kind of demon is in there well this one i've got to go be in some more prayer in order to get it out well where did jesus peter james and john just come from a prayer meeting up on the mount come away by yourselves to pray that's why they were up there jesus comes back ready to handle it the guys down below did not you need to stay prayed up in other words if you want to be able to handle whatever situation you're in that was true of daniel that's true of me and you the problem is we neglect christ's counsel to the disciples in the garden of gethsemane jesus can see what's coming watch and lest you enter into temptation and they fell asleep and jesus prayed he was the only one ready to take on that struggle as those soldiers came to arrest him he was ready to go the others were not ready for it at all remember peter takes out a sword and tries to defend jesus with the arm of the flesh and literally cuts a guy's ear off the servant of the high priest jesus has to pick the ear back up and glue it back on you know what supernatura the lord has to heal something that peter in the flesh was", "doing and peter gets rebuked by jesus one more time if those those who live by the sword will die by the sword too many of us have a kind of a a saying on top of our prayer life to be used only in case of emergency kind of like break glass in case of a burden i'm gonna go to my prayer life when i really have a problem there's nothing wrong with praying when you have a problem but you're gonna struggle with really that being a prayer of faith and not just saying well i'll it's like that guy who called the insurance company and he said hey do you guys insure houses they said of course they said do you insure him for fire he said yeah he said well i'd like to get my house insured for fire they said we'll have to send somebody out to take some pictures of your house and go you better hurry it's on fire right now yeah it's a little too late and too often that's the problem put this down we need though to also understand understand our enemy he introduces the devil in this metaphor he says your and he describes him like a lion prowling about like a roaring lion and he's seeking someone to devour now we've all heard that so i want to start by saying we all know because we come to church read our bibles what the bible says about the devil but i think we really have this kind of a christian mindset that when i read my bible when i'm in sunday school when i'm at church we can talk about the devil with christians but in my real i really don't think that he has much to do with that at all listen to this this was during world war when it first broke out the war ministry in london dispatched a coded message to one of the british outposts in the inaccessible areas of africa the message read quote war declared arrest all enemy aliens in your district the war ministry received this reply later on that day we've arrested ten six belgians four frenchmen two italians three austrians and an american please advise immediately who are we at war they started going out and arresting all these people they we didn't know who we're actually fighting and i do believe that is a good picture of many why because paul says this in the book of ephesians we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities and powers in the high places in other words our problem really is not with people but", "too often it is we say oh i know that it's satan but in reality it's like you know it's my boss or it's my mother-in-law or it's my you name it you know your your parents we make that mistake of not really seeing the work of satan behind and by the way satan does use people there's no question about that read the book of job what does the devil say well the reason honors you is because you bless him just take the blessings away take his kids away take his wealth away take his reputation away and take his health away right and he'll curse you that was what satan said who was it that brought that message of cursed god and died to him wasn't satan not a pa speaker it was his wife you mean i can be used my mouth can be used of the devil oh yeah it can be your mouth is set on fire by heaven or hell the bible says in james the tongue is a fire it can be a tongue of the fire of the holy spirit that's acts 2 or it can be a flame to damage people your your mouth can be set on fire by either direction but the fact is satan is behind it and yes he does use people but they are not the enemy satan's methods are many times very subtle he's called the serpent of old but his methods can also be sudden how we handle temptation or trials that happen to us suddenly like a lion that's pouncing on us and here's what we're told in the new paul says we are not ignorant of his in other words satan has devices and they're different for each one of us see when uh was going into jericho the bible says that he looked at it like a commanding general would do he was looking at the city probably looking for areas of vulnerability he didn't know god's battle plan yet was not going to be to attack it directly but to surround it and it was going to be an act of faith but that's what you do you evaluate when you're going to attack what are the weaknesses the vulnerabilities of the enemy it's an interesting thing because in the book of job god says to satan have you considered my servant job in other words have you looked at him for his weaknesses that's what the word means in the original have you considered him and looked for where can you exploit him and the answer was you you need to know that satan and the", "demonic forces have studied you they know where you're weak they know where you fail that is exactly where you're going to be attacked the only way to have victory is to do what peter says in this passage i need to learn how satan works who my enemy is and how i can defend myself now there are two major weapons that satan uses it's interesting he peter compares him to a lion and of course the problem with a lion is going to probably be his mouth and that's always the case with satan he is john 8 a liar he always lies he's the father of lies remember he puts a question where god puts a period we see that in the garden with eve and adam hath god said he asks a question when god told them what they could and can eat but he puts a question when jesus is tempted god has just said in the baptism this is my beloved son so what does satan say if you are the son of god he's always putting questions where god puts a period but here we realize that satan is our enemy his weapon in his is his mouth and he uses lies and deception the other big weapon that he has is fear he went through deception he wants to create dread in you and terror that will lead you to unbelief put this down determine to withstand him that's the when you study the armor of god in ephesians we'll jot it down ephesians 6 and verse 13 we have the same answer to satan's attack therefore take up the full armor that you may be able to resist in the evil day having done everything to stand firm now it's interesting as you study the armor of god during ephesians 6 you'll find that there's a piece of armor for every part of the body a soldier's armor and even a offensive weapon the sword of the spirit the word of god but there is one part of the anatomy that is not protected in the armor of god and that is the back because it is never god's successful strategy to overcome the devil now sometimes it is for temptation but for the devil himself it's always to resist in the bible that's important you are equipped through the armor of god to resist the devil not to run from the devil um it's interesting i don't know who would ever read this and get any value from it but i found online how to survive a lion attack now i don't know where you're excuse me", "i gotta go check up uh alex you know i don't know when anybody would be accessing this information but they've written this out so here just written by somebody who i guess is number one if a lion should confront you your backyard or something first thing don't panic this is not a comedy website this is just i thought to myself are you kidding anyway don't panic you're in trouble already number two don't run stand your ground they said if you run they'll sense your fear and they will chase you they're fast uh then the next uh thing was remain standing they said the lion will likely go for your face and throat oh how's the don't panic thing gonna work now uh this means that it will jump and you will have a full view of the giant cat while this sounds terrifying it will help you to have a good view of the animal oh thank you i've always wondered what let me take a sh selfie if you were to crouch down you would have much less of a chance to fight back if it attacked you at this angle then it says this besides standing and remain standing shout as loudly as possible and raise your hands again truly yell from the depths of your well you still have one and then finally fight back the cat is likely to be much stronger than you you it's brilliant but hitting it in the head and the eyes will have a great impact and could turn the line off of you i'm thinking yeah what are the chances of that are you gonna keep hitting it because there's multiple course meal anyway so these are the instructions and i found them just very interesting in light of what peter has to say about actually fighting satan there actually is a lot of parallels jot this down number three don't run from but toward the roar of the lion we've talked about this before but let me remind you lions you know are terrifying they're the king of the beasts and they're huge animals for those of you that haven't been around them i highly encourage you to keep a safe distance but they're amazing becky and i had the privilege of going out to dinner with a couple from our church who took us to a place where you eat dinner and then they bring in the lions not with where you are but right near where you are and wow they're amazing an interesting thing about lions is they get old the male lions", "and uh a lot of times they have teeth i've seen photos they lose their teeth they break their teeth and that makes it very difficult to hunt obviously but besides that lions as male lions as they age lose their speed they cannot run as fast as they used to run actually the lionesses the younger lionesses are the ones who do most of the lionesses can run about 45 miles an hour that's about 30 faster than the old lions can run in addition as lions get older they struggle with arthritis in fact i just read of two different zoos in the united states that are euthanizing their their male alliance because of horrible arthritic pain so these are normal aging problems in the male line so while they get older and they can't really run and chase it becomes a problem with survival for them but what they never lose is their roar a lion's roar can be heard about five miles away it is a deafening about 114 decibel roar and it shakes the ground in anything and anybody uh near it and if you've ever heard a lion roar in person and not just before a movie on tv you realize uh it's it's a it's a powerful thing and so what they tell us is old lions will many times hunt with young lionesses in the pride and they they're smart enough the old lion knows he can't chase down the prey he'll lose so he'll go down to one side of the savannah couch down so nothing can see him the lionesses will go down to the other end of the savannah and then when they're ready the old lion will roar and everything in between him and those young lions that are hiding instinctively in terror will run right towards the young lionesses they will just take him down and eat them and the old lion will join them very smart lions so there's only one thing if you could talk to those animals which you can't and give them some wisdom when that there's only one answer they need to run towards the roar the exact opposite of everything inside of them but guess what that's true for me and you too when that circumstance that tragedy that circumstance that's beyond you and overwhelming you happens you need to know that's exactly what's happening satan is trying to terrify he has no power there's an old saying his teeth were pulled at the cross he's trying to gum you to death but he's got the roar and if he can freak you out he can", "control you not be by his power but by i think of david in the old testament remember the story i'm sure you do everybody remembers david and goliath but remember he's a shepherd boy he's not a soldier his brothers are soldiers dad sends him with some stuff to go give the captain and and his brothers to see how the battle's going and so david shows up on assignment with some stuff from he's left the sheep and he comes to the battle area down in the valley of ela and there's no battle the the armies of israel are there and the armies of the philistines are there but there's no battle going on he's kind of like what's going on here well what's going on here is there's this giant goliath this massive warriors coming out challenging the entire army of israel saying send out your best guy we don't need to have a big war with a lot of people i just you pull your best guy out here i'm their best guy let's go for it whoever wins and what happens every time 40 days in a row when he comes out and belches out this threat the army of israel runs in and david's going what's with this this doesn't make any sense to me but david says what happens you know what is the guy who beat this guy what does he get well he gets to marry his the king's daughter he won't have taxes his whole family he'd be tax free it's like that sounds pretty good he didn't even sign up to blow a fight but some people told king saul hey there's one guy who's crazy enough to go fight that guy you should talk to him so king saul calls in david and of course he's going you're just a shepherd boy you ca this guy's been a killer since he was a youth you're just a kid do you remember what david said well i do take care of sheep but let me tell you something about my dad's sheep there's been an occasion where it was attacked the sheep were attacked by a bear another time when it was attacked by a lion let me tell you what happened when that bear came in and grabbed when that lion came in and grabbed his sheep let me tell you what i did i ran out confronted it grabbed the lion by its beard and i struck a dead and guess what what i did to that lion i'll do to this so saul says well that's our best shot", "and do you remember what happened when goliath came out okay bring him out bring going somebody wants to fight me so little david comes out well i don't think he was a little boy but he was certainly no warrior and he has no armor on he didn't even have a he's got a slingshot you know it's like a little toy and and goliath starts mocking him i am going to feed your flesh to the birds you're going down you're about to die terrifying stuff do you remember david didn't seem to be too worried about that he said actually it's going to go the other way i'll be feeding you to the birds today because you see you come out to me with a sword and a javelin and a spear but i come to you in the name of the lord of armies the god whom you defied you've blown it today man you came against the wrong god it has nothing to do with me see everybody else goliath that's too big to fight david saw goliath is too big to miss because god was in it the bible says he did what he ran into the battle exactly what we're told we need to do stop running from the roar you're playing right in to the enemy's hands think about jesus after he is baptized he goes out to the wilderness driven by the holy spirit the bible says to be tempted of the devil for 40 days and nights he's out there no after which he becomes hungry i've always found that to be an for me it would have been after 40 minutes i became hungry jesus is there for a month and 10 days and anyway he becomes he's starting to starve and that's when satan shows up with that question if you are the son of god if you are what he claimed you were at the turn these stones into bread he he tells him if god really loves you he'll provide for you but you can use your miraculous powers to do that and you remember that jesus answers every single one of his temptations with it is written jot down james 4 and verse 7. he said how do i withstand the devil submit therefore to god resist the devil and he will flee from in our text we are resisting the devil firm in our faith it's important you see the to god before you can stand before satan you must first bow before god and you must have your faith strengthened how do i get my faith strengthened faith comes by", "hearing and hearing the word concerning christ or the word of god you want to be stronger in your faith spend more time in the word of god there's always a relationship between spiritual strength and god's word remember john says i've written to you young men because you're strong and the word of god abides in you and you have overcome the wicked one those always go together i need to not only know god's word i need to believe now another lie of the devil is taking care of in verse nine not only should we not be afraid we need to run towards the roar and resist him firm in our faith but notice what he says in verse nine because he ties the two together knowing as you're resisting satan the same experiences of suffering are being accomplished by your brethren who are in the world see another lie of the devil about your circumstances is you're the only one going through this have you noticed that suffering whether it's a tragedy or circumstance or some failure on your part tends to isolate you from other people sometimes we don't want to tell other people what's happening maybe because of what we've done or maybe it's like i don't want all the attention on me i don't want people can i pray for you and no you can't i don't want i just got to go through this so i don't want everybody thinking about me talking to me i don't like it i'd rather not go to church i'll skip church right now because i don't want i don't want people to know what i'm going through satan loves it when you see yourself as all alone remember when elijah up on mount carmel they had the contest by fire who's the the god baal or the god yahweh children of israel were called out for this contest the prophets of baal 450 of them were there and there was this contest who's the real god and you remember we know how that story entered ended god finally moves the prophets of baal had a god that didn't exist so nothing happened when they prayed but when elijah prays a brief prayer god sends fire from heaven and the whole altar is consumed and the people say the lord is god jehovah's god it was a great day but it doesn't last long right after that jezebel who's the queen says elijah you're going to be just as dead as my prophets i'm putting a hit out on you the queen of the country you're dead and elijah freaks out this", "you go why did he i don't know why did peter freak out before the campfire girls but he could stand before the soldiers it's just the way it is okay and so here he freaks out because the queen's gonna kill him and he runs from the roar which he shouldn't do goes down under a juniper tree outside by the way the political boundaries of israel so that at least maybe she can't catch me down here but he says god i want to die and god says let's talk and he gives them supernatural strength to go all the way out to mount horeb or mount sinai where the law was given where god met with moses and remember he's in a cave there and god comes to him and says elijah what are you doing here and he goes into this big spiel about i'm just faithful and nobody he just he tells god twice i'm the only one who's really living for you which he was living for the lord but his perception that he was the only one who's going through any suffering was completely wrong god said there are 7 000 in israel who have not bowed the knee you're not the only one stop thinking you are it's part of the lie of you know um in new york in utica there's a museum of the marathon the people who hold the records for running marathons every year i guess in the united states or maybe in the world these people who have clearly become examples to other runners and encouraging them the bible has such a museum if you will it's called hebrews 11 in hebrews 12. there's a whole hall of faith hall of fame of men and women in the bible who greater trials than you and me will ever face but have done so victoriously and are now in the grandstands that's why the writer says seeing that we have so great a cloud of witnesses surrounding us people who know that god has been faithful though it's been hard they have come through it victoriously cheering us on and really the writer to the hebrews is saying you need their encouragement ecclesiastes 4 and verse 12. ecclesiastes 4 and verse 12 if one can overpower him who is alone well two can resist him you need to be involved with other christians who have also suffered when you're going through suffering put this down let it be stand strong in stand strong in god's grace in verse 10 after you have suffered for a little while you say well how long is a little while pastor bob", "well this lifetime compared to eternity say oh are you kidding me this is what paul says momentary light affliction is producing for us an eternal weight of glory far beyond all comparison paul says in romans 8 i don't consider the suffering of this present time worthy to be compared to the glory that's to be revealed i have no idea how long your little time is in the book of revelation jesus says to the church that's about to suffer satan will cast some of you into prison for 10 you say well i can handle if i know it's you know how do you handle a root canal you just realize it's not for the rest of your life you know it's just for the rest of this miserable two hours or whatever you know 15 minutes seems like three days in but when you know it's not going to be forever it does help you so jesus says satan's going to cast some of you into prison for 10 days you say well that's not too bad he says be faithful on the death he's like what i thought it was 10 days yeah you'll be and i'll give you the crown of life so i can't tell you how long your suffering will be except that it is limited that should actually be an encouragement to you after you have suffered for a little while whatever god decides whether it's days or lifetime the god noticed this of all who called you to his eternal glory in christ will perfect confirm strengthen in the outline put it down put in the word grace you start with god's grace and you end with god's glory it's the god who called you ultimately to his glory we need to remember that at the beginning of a christian's life with the lord is grace that's how you got saved at the end it's going to be glory we're going to talk about how to get through the problems in between peter has an incredible focus on god's grace and if you think you and i should understand clearly why why well peter was an expert on it why is he an expert not just theologically but personally and practically he was kind of an expert he had fallen into pride when he said though all these forsake you i never concerning the other disciples he had fallen into doubt when he was walking on the water for a while and then in unbelief he started to sing he fell asleep in the garden of gethsemane when jesus said to stay awake and he", "fell into denial of the lord when he denied christ he was a regular fall guy you might say he's falling all and peter would have said this basically and it's kind of what i think you need to hear behind what he's saying everyone here knows about my failings in other words you've read the gospels there it's all recorded there for everybody to see for all of eternity he failed jesus again and again frankly i think it's one of the reasons we like peter is a spiritual leader there's no question about it he's first in all the list of the apostles he is bold sometimes to his detriment i mean you know peter peter rebuked uh then jesus rebuked peter jesus said i'm going to jerusalem i'm going to die the son of man will be handed over nope never going to happen he rebuked him the next verse is so jesus rebuked peter get behind me satan oh wow that's wonderful the last time god called you satan that's what you call a bad day right before that he was making this wonderful you thou art the christ the son of the living god blessed are you simon barjona he's simon barjona and then he's satan and then a few minutes later it's like he's up on the mount of transfiguration that's a privilege peter james and john get to go with jesus to see the kingdom of god come in power the others didn't get to see it they fall asleep up there oops when they were supposed to be praying and then they wake up and jesus is glorified and transfigured and there's this cloud of glory the shekinah presence of god and moses is there and elijah is there and peter just has to it's good that we're here we should stay here let's make should i make three tabernacles one for mo one for elijah when jesus you're just equal with them right and we'll stay that was not god's plan for jesus to stay on the mountain of glory it's for him to die down below no peter you didn't have to say anything you just had to enjoy it but no what does god say this is my son listen to him god the father rebukes peter might as well take off the whole trinity you know i mean we're just you know can i just say this i don't care how long you're a christian you will never outgrow the need for grace in your life get used to it get use get used to the fact that you're still going to sin you're going to fall", "short i hope you sin less i hope you sin not as grievous as used but but just be aware that's going to be part of your journey peter has a lot of failings behind him so he tells people basically i understand what i'm talking about god wants to use you in a great way but just realize god uses people who fail in the bible think about moses we'd all commit he's greatly used of god to deliver the nation of israel out of let's remember moses was also a murderer and in his own pride thought he could do what god would not allow him to do until he was radically humbled at the age of 80 at 40 he thought he could do it how about david well we all admit david we all want to be like david i want to dance like david dance and david's on fire and everybody's measured against david yeah he also committed adultery and he also committed murder these guys some of the people that god used the greatest had some rap sheets that are like whoa how about paul the apostle we would all admit he wrote the new testament he was greatly used maybe the greatest man of all of history used of the lord to share the gospel it's true but before he had the blood of the lamb on his mind he had the blood of the saints on his hands and he never forgot it ever you will never outgrow your need for grace paul didn't either that's why he said this thorn in the flesh that he wanted taken away god said no we got to keep it in your life to keep you humble i got a text on my way to church this sound ministry and from my son the question was well what's the title my son sent me a text i had sent him because i always give him the title to do the backgrounds and it says stand in grace he sent me a picture of my own screenshot that i had sent him like this dad you said this and the people here were saying well that's not the title the title is so what do you want us to do and i realized i i guess i made a mistake so they asked me which one do you want i said you just leave it it'll work perfect for this message because the fact is standing in victory is standing in grace it's the same message no matter who you are you will not be able to get beyond it as much as", "i hate to fail and hurt people and everything it's a reminder that i stand in the grace of god and peter realized that he did too and he was calling you don't have to make the same mistakes that i made learn from my mistakes put this down number two the answer to my current suffering is his complete to him be to minion forever it's his grace that gives me victory because i'm still i still fail but it's also his governing that gives me the ability to trust him listen you've often heard me say if you go to this church for any length of the time i believe in what i call the three r's of rejoicing what does that mean there's always reason to rejoice remember paul says rejoice in the and again i'll say rejoice your circumstances may not warrant rejoicing maybe you're weeping but you can still rejoice in the lord because of three things actually more than three but these are the three that i like to focus on i call them the three hours number one that he has risen from the dead if you have nothing else you praise god the christ is risen that takes care of your past failings all of that he is returning that's the third r takes care of your fog about the future i don't know everything's gonna happen but i know how the story ends and we win so i'll rejoice in the fact that christ is coming back but the middle r is the fact that he is ruling right now and it is key to be able to stand in you know um i i know this and i think most of you know this too when we don't live through in history we can read about it and study about it but it lacks some power in our life it might be uh world war ii you've read read about it you know it was horrific the attack on pearl harbor these were terrible things but many of us either weren't old enough or weren't some of us weren't but for us 9 11 is most of us remember where we were in that whole thing i was watching a documentary on 9 11 with my grandson who's 5 the other day and uh just in case you're not sure you're new uh anyway and i was trying to explain to him what happened on that day and this they were showing the planes one at a time and news coverage and and uh he knew nothing about and he's five and he has no memory of it", "of course but i was trying to educate him and i saw as i was trying to share with him i was getting kind of choked up because of how profound that day was in my life as an american in fact for many of you here you'll remember or maybe for years if not still after that every digital clock at when you looked at it and it said 9 11 you couldn't help but think about that day and um so i'm trying to explain to a five-year-old something that he didn't live through and i realized this isn't um i want him to sense the how profound and uh you know and he said well when are the buildings gonna collapse like we're watching but they're still up like and i thought uh yeah it takes a while and i said some people actually jumped off to their deaths and he's going well it was like this is not like some action movie that you want to look forward to those moments but it was so not his life experience and he's too young to get it and i was thinking about this because some of us are old enough to remember where we were on another day like 9 11 in 1963 in november i was in first grade and the lunch lady came screaming through the campus the president's been shot the president's been shot they herded us all on the buses and they sent we didn't know what was going on and all eyes were glued on our little black and white portable tv in my living room as my family gathered together and we were going what's happening what what does this mean because most of us at that time were wondering when the russians were going to nuke us anyway we were practicing that duck and cover that was a part of the reality of the cuban missile crisis these were the real things we were living through is this the beginning and this guy that they they've arrested who is he and oh he had defected to russia information was slowly coming out it's like are they going to assassinate the vice president and the speaker of the house are we going to have a government what's going to happen next are we about to be is life going to get even worse as horrible as do you remember those days how many of you remember what i'm talking about okay now i don't bring that memory up because it's a pleasant memory but i i need to give you a sense of what was going on in israel", "when isaiah was the prophet and the news came that the king had just died king uzziah had reigned for 52 for a lot of people that was their whole life most of their whole life and god had blessed his reign it got the nation got stronger more peaceful prosperity things were good he wasn't a perfect king but he was a great king but now he's dead and when a king who's been on the throne that long dies now what of course is what everybody's what's going on are we going to get invaded oh what's going to happen now who's in charge that's the time coups happened in many countries the king dies now what's going to happen and so in isaiah 6 he says it was in the year king uzziah died that i saw the lord high and lifted up sitting on a throne listen here's the idea the throne of israel is vacant but the throne of this universe is not you need to see it there and you need to see it in the in the book of revelation in the new testament john the beloved all the other apostles are dead for their faith john now has been arrested he's the last one who was part of the apostles team banished exiled by the emperor of the roman empire not by some local magistrate by domitian sent to the rock island to die can disconnected from the church he's going to die there for his faith and while he is there in that dark place that he didn't want to be a hard place the greatest revelation ever given to man concerning the future and in chapter four of that revelation what happens i heard a voice saying come up here and suddenly was in the spirit he's in heaven and what is the first thing that god shows him a throne in heaven and one sitting on the throne in other words forget about the mission he's not in charge we are you're okay you know domitian will be dead in less than a year john will be freed go back to ephesus have a still years of ministry see this is the point that peter is making when you're going through tragedy the only way you can stand in victory is to remember god's but also to remember god is governing right now it's key he's in charge though i can't see how he's going to do what he's going to do i don't have to worry about that i just need to know our god is in the heavens he does whatever he pleases put this", "down let her see stand together with how can i stand in the midst of my trials my temptations we stand together with god's people in verse 12 at the end of this epistle don't just think this is a little signing off with a few names through that means i am writing to you through this guy sylvanus also known as silas he goes our faithful brother so i regard him i have written to you briefly exhorting and testifying that this is the true grace of god stand firm in it she who is in babylon now there are differences of opinion who peter is referring to i'm just going to tell you uh there are those who believe that peter was actually in okay i am not one who believes that we have nothing in history that would suggest he was ever there we do have tradition in church history which is not the bible that says his end of his days is associated with rome i told you from the beginning i believe peter's already in rome i believe peter will die in rome church tradition church history does tell us that's where he rome being called babylon may well be a code name if you write a book and you put the word roman there your book isn't going to get out very well so he didn't want to put the word rome in there and by the way in the book of revelation rome and the uh is called mystery babylon it's connected with rome but in any case so it's probably he's in rome she is probably a reference to the believers the church the bride of christ the ecclesia which is a feminine noun she who is in babylon chosen or elect together with you sends you greetings so the church is sending a greeting and so does my son just put this down don't underestimate your never-ending need for grace i i it's interesting how often he brings up grace and this one we've been emphasizing it here but on a practical level we need to realize as christians it's very easy to move from a grace relationship with god to a performance relationship with god it's very easy to do that especially among bible-believing christians we want to serve the lord and we want to do it because he saved us but it's easy to start to think he'll only bless us if we serve him enough and he's only happy with us when we do really well and god's angry with us when we're not um in galatians 3 3 paul says to the churches in galatia who were", "becoming legalistic having begun by the spirit would you be perfected by the back in the late 50s and early 60s there was a nationwide broadcast now everything's everybody can see it on the internet but back then there was local television and then there was live tv or pardon me there was nationwide tv we mostly recorded then they came out with live nationwide tv which was a big thing so it was happening in real time the ed a really big shoe um was on a variety show and he had on all kinds of acts one of them that he had in the late 50s about nine times was a guy named eric brem eric bren was a now i don't know how many of you have ever even seen anybody ever seen plate spinning okay it's kind of a circus act that got into this entertainment show and what he would do is this this guy eric would come out on stage he would set up his table and he would put up these four foot long sticks and he would start spinning a plate or a bowl on top and then he would start another one and then he would start another one but by the time he was doing the third one the first two started to wobble and they looked like they were about to fall down so the audience would go like you'd be at home going hey don't let it fall be embarrassing you're kind of into it and he knows that so he so he he sets up a ton of them up on the stage he's doing all these and they're wobbling all around and so he's running back and forth keeping them just barely going and he's obviously it's it's this act 40 years ago i heard a preacher talk about ed sullivan's show cause i had seen it when i was a kid and uh he said that's a good picture of the church that's a good picture of a lot of christians in the church a person receives christ everybody celebrates they've given by faith they've given their life to the lord but right away people start saying so how are you doing with your walking lord pretty good well are you reading the bible am i supposed to be reading about yeah you should bible study you got to read you build up your faith okay reading the bible reading the bible reading the bible and then they come to georgia how you doing good i'm reading the bible what about prayer uh prayer okay reading the bible and prayer reading the bible and prayer", "read the bible in prayer go to church you witnessing ah you know you're starting all these things you're trying to keep them going a million never thinking somehow your performance is gonna make you acceptable to god it's very easy to get off on the wrong track you begin by the work of the spirit that's based on faith and you wind up in some with god finally put this down see you can't stand being alone on the day of pentecost prophecy of jeremiah god said i'm going to i'm gonna do a new covenant with you israel not the old covenant where i put my law on stones i'm gonna write on your and the spirit of god is gonna come into you and give you the ability not just knowledge of what i want but even the desire to obey and the power to obey and that's what happened on the day of pentecost acts chapter 2 the spirit of god came just like jesus had prophesied i'm going to go to heaven and i'm going to send him i i count four miracles that happened most count three the first miracle was there was a mighty rushing wind actually it doesn't say there was any wind it says it was the sound of a mighty rushing wind so it was sound that drew people's attention then the bible says that tongues of fire appeared above the heads of the 120. so that was a miracle then it says they spoke in languages they had never studied in their life before and they spoke in tongues fulfilling what jesus said in mark 16 believers would have speak in new languages they've never studied it was a but the fourth miracle is usually overlooked by most don't overlook it it's acts 2 and verse 14. if you want to jot it down acts 2 14 it simply says taking his stand with the eleven you say well that's the miracle there you don't find peter doing that until the day he was filled with the holy his own and the bottom line is this what peter said in verse nine don't forget the brethren that are suffering that should help you i also have a team of people that are around me sylvanus who i'm actually who's writing and the church that's with me sends greetings and by the way my son mark now think about this for a moment who is sylvanus that would be silas who accompanied paul on his missionary journey paul and silas in the silas is the number two guy under paul he's always in his shadow", "by the way silas was a prophet he could preach himself but he's not preaching here he's just the secretary for peter he's in somebody else's shadow he is a faithful guy but he's content to be there he's faithful he's a faithful by the way most believe that the quality of the greek of first peter has to be is proof that silas wrote it because probably peter as a fisherman could not have written the quality of greek you get a second peter it's a lot rougher it's like peter wrote this one now i'm not saying these are the words of silas these are the words of peter but they came through silas so venus just he's part of the ministry team and then you have mark now mark appears to be most would agree this is somebody that peter led to the lord it's not his biological son it's like paul's timothy his son in the faith and mark is the same person that we know of as john mark that was the cousin of barnabas who was on the first missionary journey with paul and barnabas and split he failed but barnabas took apart from paul because paul wouldn't go with him anymore and restored him so here's a guy who knows something about grace as well these are trophies of grace that are with peter there in rome just interesting background on them but what's interesting even more so to me is that peter is saying i have a team of people around me and i stand with them just as you need to stand with the community that you're with most of you have heard or remember alex alex haley is the author of the book roots that became the miniseries watched by 130 million people back in the 70s alex he was very successful and uh he's passed but uh in his office he had a picture that he had on the wall it was a picture of a turtle up on a fence post and he kept it there and when people would say what's that about he would say i remind myself when i'm feeling pretty good about myself that i'm the turtle and no turtle got up on a fence post had to have some friends to get him no turtle climbs up a fence by themselves in other words anything that i do any place i've gotten somebody has helped me to get there and that's really what peter is saying i stand with a little help from my friends in the lord and i want you to know i'm not standing here alone though i've", "spent too much time the gospel is claiming i could do it all me and jesus i have learned the hard way that i need the help of other people and that's why i want to encourage you to consider the engagement project i want you to consider getting involved in small groups because there's something that god does uniquely through relationships where people really know each other are in the trenches battling for each other the final two verses greet one another with a kiss of love by the way that was men with men and women with women don't try anything peace or shalom be to you all who notice are in christ i just think i want to say one more thing before we close and that's this every person in this room every person on this planet we're all born with a missing peace that can only come to us after we are in christ he ties those two together you get the peace after you're in christ and by the way being in christ is much different than being in church plenty of people come to church who never come to christ but thinking that you're in christ because you come to church would like calling yourself an athlete because you have athlete's foot or you must be a cop because you like krispy kreme donuts it doesn't work that coming to christ listen to me and i'm done worship people can come to prove it coming to christ listen if it's genuine is always a moving experience now you may feel nothing but it's always a moving experience that's colossians 1 13 the bible says moved us from the domain of darkness into the kingdom of his beloved son there must be a transfer you're not born there you're born again into that and maybe your need today before is to experience that transfer we would love to talk to you about that our prayer room is open you feel like i'm a christian i just need to go trust the lord with my trial i need to learn how to run towards the roar because it's never going to come natural you're right it won't or i need to have some other brothers and sisters holding me up praise god but if you're hearing me say i've never been transferred into the kingdom of god i don't even know what that means we'd love to help you make the transfer because he's accepting transfers today would you stand with me in a closing song what's wrong with me i know many of you don't come on wednesday nights and that's something i", "pray if it works out that you can start coming you might but you know god tells his people in 26 chapters he tells them how to sacrifices that represent jesus christ and the fulfillment of what he's done for us there's no other way but in the final chapter something changes and he gives them a voluntary he tells them how to dedicate themselves and how to dedicate i want to talk to you on wednesday night you're saved god was telling his saved people you're saved but this is up to you do you want the fullness of my blessing in your life to discover what your life is about you've got to make the choice i won't force you but don't live your christian life a saved person is going to heaven and miss the blessing of what god wants to do in your life because you've never fully dedicated yourself to the lord or your marriage or your your where you work or what you have i want to encourage you and equip you to do that this week on wednesday night but may the lord bless you may he keep you may he make his face to shine upon you and be gracious unto you may he lift up his countenance upon you and give you his peace in the name of the father and the son and the holy ghost god bless you", "let's pray let's continue to sing we're gonna open with a song called a thousand hallelujahs you know with a thousand hallelujahs we magnify your name with a thousand hallelujahs and a thousand more he's been praised before he'll be praised after he'll be praised forevermore and eternity starts today lord we're so grateful but that you have been a shelter through all generations the generations that came before will be after us let me pray that you would return before that happens but if you don't but we know that our future is secure in you and we'll be worshiping you for all of eternity so i pray for those kids that are maybe nervous going into those classes lord that those folks would just pour into their lives lord and i pray for us in here maybe there's people that are joining us for the first time that we're a little bit nervous to get here maybe they're watching online i don't know but you see lord we pray that we would not be an audience tonight would be a family we gathered in your name to praise your name to lift you high and then to hear from you and that we would be able to say years and years from now just of the and talk of the faithfulness of you in our lives and then those who go before us be so help us to stir one another to good works help us to encourage one another with psalms hymns and spiritual songs and help us to prepare for your return as we are transformed more into the image of christ so we love you we pray these in starts to shine to the king here we will sing you are the world the name of what a beautiful name it is nothing compared to this what a beautiful name it is the name of i didn't want heaven my sin was great your love was name great is what a wonderful name it day it is name it is the is of what a powerful name it what a is name it is what a powerful name it is i turned to heaven your loving kindness tore through the shallows of my soul the work is finished i could imagine he's the one who set me free your buried body began to breathe set me free set me free and lord we are excited every time we sing of this and we uh we rejoice we exalt your name because of this truth but also we also sit with the weight of what it took to accomplish humbled by it", "we are grateful for it we are driven to worship we're driven to glorify your name would you indeed a man of sorrows acquainted with deepest grief in a world where it seems like grief is all around us be hard to focus on the fact that you are risen reigning and you're returning you're on your throne so lord as we quiet our hearts as we prepare to receive sit with the gravity of what you've done and rest in the victory of what you've it's not without a cost but lord is not our cost that we have the pain is because of you i can't repay it didn't earn it you give it freely and so we thank you talk about your holiness as pastor bob delivers the message lord we pray that that would be our desire is to by being here together not just that we would celebrate and applaud you the lord that we would uh take that with us outside these walls to lost and hurting and dying world order to proclaim the name of jesus that they would know that whatever they're going through whatever we are going through you know sympathize because you're acquainted with our grace no other god would do that no one would invent a god that would do but the true king the true god has done that and so we're so grateful for silent as he should have used praising it on earth is paid in full that my jesus now the curse of sin has no hold on me whom the sun sets set us free you know i sometimes think about people who are content don't sit down yet i'll get there in a sec give me a second uh who are content to just come to a meeting where the lord is and listen which is what most of us are here to do and there's nothing wrong with that but then there are others who sense i need to get closer to him i want to i want to near to him i don't want to just be in a crowd of people listening to him i want to touch him i want him to touch me i want him to i want to have an experience with the lord and we come into his presence to allow the lord to use his word to change us to allow his people to be part of that he says where two or more gathered what what is the promise hey he's here do you really believe that i i do i believe satan wants to keep us", "the lord and from each other so let's do something biblical greet one another with a holy handshake or a hug say hello to someone you don't know greet them well we like to remind you on wednesday night because we know some of you are we call it next step wednesday is kind of our next step meaning if you've been coming on sunday morning and you're saying well i i wanted to know more i want to get involved more and of course we hope and pray you're coming in part because you want to study the old testament you want to see the lord jesus in the old testament with us and grow by getting into god's word more but there's a lot going on in our church besides our no amount of time could we we'd have to commit so much to really go over it all we want you to be in touch so many of you have signed up for our text messaging and if you have not tonight's a good time to do that so you do that by texting uh right here ccea which stands for our church to the number 59769 let's leave that up for just a moment if you're here and you have not you're not getting the text messages they're going to help you and you'll be informed as quickly as anybody else will when things are happening at our church so please take a moment you can do it right now we encourage you to do that we'd like to see that list blow up because uh it allows us to communicate super quick when there's a need and to stay informed and by the way i think they're also saying what's how was the dinner tonight looked amazing was it good yeah roast beef some of you didn't see it i just smelled it and i felt like that dog on that cartoon where he kind of laughs and do you remember that you know anyway uh it looked and smelled delicious next week i think they're having barbecue ribs too so it's going to be a great night invite some friends from sunday morning we want to see more people come out and summer comes kids are out of school we're going to see a lot more uh children among us we're excited about that as well on wednesday night so a few other things there's a once a month evangelism study so it meets once a month maybe you can't go to a weekly bible study and you can't do anything even every other week but um josh azenov is entitling the message", "teach me how to fish and we want you to learning and growing in your capacity to share your faith and the leading and leading other people to christ i think this will be life-changing not only for you but for the people that are in your life who don't know the lord and so josh is really a gift in this area he's an he has been using his gift here for years and i'm really grateful for his willingness to teach this class so that's going to be the first sunday of each month at 1 pm in the fourth grade room so if you're interested in that i i believe it's in the app church app that's different than texting you need to download the app and you can find out more info our ladies retreat june 24th through 26th here at the church called this year the title is the giving cup and debbie alsdorf will be out more on the app or on the website and then this friday night is our and i bet a lot of you have come to that but plenty of you have not so if you've ever attended one of those did we just raise your hand i want to see how many of you have ever come to one of our newcomers dinners okay so those of you that did not raise your hand you're actually invited every time we do one of these and you might go i've already made the decision to come this is not a night where we try to convince people to come to our church it's really a night for those who feel called here to know a little bit more about who we um the pastors come our wives the elders and we just spend an evening we have a good meal you can bring your children there's stuff going on it'll be a fun night raymond will be there and uh he and his wife do a great job of helping with that it's just an important time for us we feel like to be honest with you when people come to that a lot of people it's like because we get to know them or they get to know us or each other it's like they cross over a line we don't really have a membership class as a church a lot of churches have membership classes there's nothing wrong with that other than they're not in the scriptures you didn't have to attend one but i'm fine with them i used to be a member at a church before this church started we believe if you're a", "born-again christian you're a member of the church and that's all that's important but for us this is a time to get to know you a little bit better and here at calvary you stand up so if you're if you've never come still time but we need to know you're coming for the food's sake so text or not text go on the app tell us you're coming we have just a few more spaces available we try to limit it to 50 new folks every time and we're getting close to that so we'd love you to come if you'd like to all right you know i was as we were worshiping the lord tonight i was thinking about uh something i read in the news today maybe you guys are aware the state is declaring a major drought anybody hear this in the news all right and you've already known so they're going to be having you cut down on your watering and that's always fun huh your grass is going to die and accept it so uh that's what they need to save a ton of water like 35 percent uh we we i don't know if we've ever quite had this big of a problem and i was thinking about i was thinking about rain and i was thinking about how in our modern society at least some of us i'm not a big fan of certain weather conditions i'm like some people like the wind i don't get that at all other than it speaks of the spirit and all that i get that but man the wind's not my favorite and frankly some of you how many of you love the just love the rain see i don't understand you but uh i i do get it there are people that just love when it rains at at my house uh one of the first things because it's so rare in southern california never rains that's what the song said but it does occasionally you know there's always this thought of whoa are we ready for this and did we leave a table out in the just going to get soaked and ruined and cardboard boxes and what's what kids toys and all you know and it's probably rusting and and so i'm always thinking about trying to avoid the effects of the rain when it rains and i was thinking about what the bible says here's what the lord said in isaiah for as the rain and the snow come down from heaven and do not return there without watering the earth and making it bear and sprout and", "furnishing seed to the sower and bread to the eater so will my word be which goes forth from my mouth god says it will not return to me void or empty without accomplishing what i desire and without succeeding in the matter for which i sent it and i was thinking about that tonight as we're going through leviticus it might be easy to tune out and say whatever you know old testament study doesn't really apply to me because i'm not under the law and i'm not part of the nation of israel if you believe and i think you do that god's word is inspired and eternal that's partially i think why you're here in a study of leviticus to believe there's value for every one of us but you need for a moment tonight to prepare spiritually i think we should every time we open the bible but here's the idea let it rain lord your word is as rain but have i gotten here to church somehow and i got my umbrella up and i frankly don't really expect anything to happen and i'm not really looking for anything to happen you and i need to look at it's kind of like with me at the house i'm trying to avoid the rain any any effects of it at on my life and the lord is saying i send the raid to make things grow it is my blessing in your life and seed needs it the bible is seed it's the word of god and remember the parable of the sword the seed went out but there are different reactions to it you and i need the power of god's word to change our lives and so tonight maybe just to say at the beginning lord would you speak to me would you would you let it rain i i want to be here tonight i don't want to listen i may be tired i may have a hard day a lot of stuff going on in my life but i don't want to insulate myself from what you want to do in my heart tonight speak to me from your word god and i'll listen and with your help i'll obey well we're in leviticus 19. so if you'll get there we'll ask the lord to let it rain beginning in verse then the lord spoke to moses saying speak to all the congregation of the sons of israel and say to them you shall be holy for i the lord your god am holy every one of you shall reverence his mother and his father and you shall keep", "i am the lord your god do not turn to idols or make for yourself molten gods i'm the lord your god now when you offer a sacrifice of peace offerings to the lord you shall offer it so that you may be accepted it shall be eaten the same day you offer it and the next day but what remains until the third day shall be burned with fire so if it is eaten at all on the third day it is an offense it will not be everyone who eats it will bear his for he has profaned the holy thing of the lord and that person shall be cut off from his people now when you reap the harvest of your land you shall reap to the um you you shall not reap sorry to the very corners of your field nor shall you gather the gleanings of your harvest the leftovers nor shall you glean your vineyard nor shall you gather the fallen fruit of your vineyard you shall leave them for the needy and for the stranger i am the lord your god you shall not steal nor deal falsely nor lie to one another you shall not swear falsely by my name so as to profane the name of your god i am the lord you shall not oppress your neighbor nor rob him the wages of a hired man are not to remain with you all night until morning you shall not curse a deaf man and or place a stumbling block before the blind but you shall revere your god and i am the lord you shall do no injustice and judgment you shall not be partial to the poor nor defer to the great but you are to judge your neighbor fairly you shall not go about as a gossip a slanderer among your people and you are not to act against the life of your neighbor i am the lord you shall not hate your fellow countrymen in your heart you may surely reprove your neighbor but you shall not incur sin because of him you shall not take vengeance nor bear any grudge against the sons of your people but you shall love your neighbor as yourself the lord father will you be lord of this service now and would you allow the water of your word to come from where it comes from which is heaven down to accomplish the work you want to do in our dry and thirsty souls lord if our lives are barren we know we need your word we need your word not just to", "hear it lord we need to believe it that it might bear fruit for eternal life so minister we pray in jesus name amen you can be seated well i hope you have the outline and you'll fill it in as we go and for those of you that are joining us online you with us we're going to talk about holiness in this chapter and we're not going to cover the whole chapter tonight but just a part of it that we just read holiness is not something that you hear much about except at church i don't know that the world even has a concept of it some of us have been in church our whole lives been reading our bible and a lot of you have been in with me through this study how many of you have been with me since i started exodus how many have been here okay quite a few of you and so much about exodus and leviticus is talking about and coming before a holy god and once again we're going to have a focus not just on who god is as holy but what it means for us to be holy so put this down god's children are to reflect god's character god if you're a child of god uh you know today my my grandson my newest grandson was born and so i i said valor i said just do me a favor i'm super excited i said just send me a picture so i can share it with the congregation and he said well actually dad my wife and i were kind of hoping to be the first to share it with people i thought yep you do that yep forget what i just said that was a big mistake you just your timing but he did he did said i'm not going to show you but he did send me the picture and uh so i'm i'm sitting here looking at this beautiful baby boy his name's luca by the way uh seven pounds nine ounces and and i was looking at him and i was and i was thinking he looks like and becky and i are talking a little bit and she goes i think he kind of looks like jeffrey now jeffrey's the one you know about anyway already and he's five and he was over at the house he was excited he has a cousin being born and you know i think he kind of does look like jeffrey but but uh then again i don't know i mean jeffrey's the most recent baby in our house so maybe i'm", "just thinking everybody looks like every baby looks like jeffrey and so when i was on the phone finally we did a facetime my son valor and and uh luca there in the hospital and uh room and uh stacy's recovering it was a c-section so she'll be in the hospital for a short i i didn't know i said valerie that's a he's a beautiful he is good looking boy you know i mean and and i said he looks like somebody and he goes uh yeah like and i didn't want to say no he looks like jeffrey i thought oh yeah you're children are to look dna tells us they're going to look something like mom and dad and by the way this concept is something you need to get familiar with if you're going to understand scripture because it's all through the bible when we talk about jesus being the son of god we think about him having this unique relationship to the father but it has to do with character like father like son remember jesus said to the jews in john 8 you are of your devil wouldn't recommend you say that to your boss at work because he's not saved or something but jesus was honest you're of your father the devil what are you talking about wouldn't you that's kind of an offensive thing to say well he said you have there you have his character see satan was a liar and a murderer from day one go back in your bibles and read about cain and the devil that's what he was he's a liar and he's a murderer and he says you're trying to kill me a man who told you the truth you're doing the deeds of your father and so it is not so much in physical characteristics but in character we see all through scripture that children resemble their parents and this is one of the things that's picked up with regard to god's people are to reflect that they have been born of god that they're really his children take a look at the text again the first couple the lord spoke to moses speak to all the congregation of the sons of israel and say to them you shall be holy for i the lord your god am put this down see holiness as your high calling as god's child and jot down ephesians five verses one and two and there's other verses we don't have time to go there but that state the same concept therefore paul says be imitators of god ah just like a beloved child", "imitates his dad and walk in love just also loved you and gave himself for us fragrant aroma children naturally want to imitate their parents for for better or worse that's not always a good thing right and sometimes grandchildren like my my grandson just once again he was declaring he's five is declaring to his grandma what he's gonna do when he grows he's he's gonna be a first he's going to work at a gas and then he's going to be a policeman and then he's going to be a pastor now if you're just wondering where he might have gotten that idea yeah that's my career path that's kind of how it works and that's so it is by that's he just wants to do it of course i'm fine with all of that it doesn't matter but but the fact is god says i want my children to reflect my character now we're talking about we use the phrase uh even in english the third degree we talk about burns the third degree burns being the most significant we we speak getting the third degree maybe you've heard that that's a old phrase that has to do with believe it or not interrogation techniques and the third degree was torture but you know they gave him the third degree it's like the you know degree that you can have now we need to understand this concept because in the hebrew mindset the number three is used all through scripture as being kind of the final uh expression of something and we can see this many times when things happen just coincidentally three times somebody help us what can you think of from the gospels that happened and it mentions it into the bible three times raise your hand if you can think of something happen three times yeah peter denied jesus three times and jesus then after the resurrection asks him three times the same exact question do you love me right okay what else what else do we see happen three times let's say in the book of acts or in the new testament three times so you can think of anybody else okay truly truly is doubled up never tripled but it is doubled for emphasis i mean amen literally in the greek but that's twice but there's three times yes thrice i ask that the thorn in the flesh might be removed and he got the same answer every time my grace is sufficient for you but he prayed three times and at the end of that if you will he came to the conclusion", "that god was giving him grace to not get healed say again you deny me three times before the crows i think it's twice but you can check it maybe you may be right yes yes holy holy holy but actions we'll get to that one because that's where we're heading but let's let's talk a little bit about how about uh peter's vision in the book of acts the unclean beast in acts 10 right regarding the gentiles three times he has the vision it's interesting it happens again and again and again to the point to where you realize well something's going on here it's not just now let's talk about what you just mentioned both in the book of isaiah chapter six when isaiah has his vision he sees the lord high and lifted up and what are the angels saying yeah they didn't know it but they were actually giving us the hymn that we would finally sing holy holy holy is the lord god almighty and then that would have been probably around the eighth century bc that's when isaiah lived when he had his vision when the king had died but now we fast forward 2 700 years or so to the end of the first century and you have john on the island of patmos and he has a vision of heaven and he sees the four living creatures and guess what they're still holy not four times but three times now some would say they're saying holy holy holy because god is a trinity the father son and holy spirit perhaps we're not told exactly why but we do know this pattern of three seems to be all through scripture by the it's interesting because we know god is love because we read first john where the bible tells us god is love that's that's his character but even though god is love you will love love love god but but holiness is the only attribute of god that is if you will raised and revealed in the third degree it doesn't mean he's not fully loving he's perfectly loving but we need to learn something about the holiness of god it's not something we just can intuitively know jot down hebrews 12 and the writer to the hebrews says pursue peace or paul if you're thinking he wrote it that's fine pursue peace with everyone and the holiness some translation say sanctification same idea without which no one will see the lord so when paul talks in philippians that his goal of his life is to know the lord remember he's already met the lord on", "the road to damascus he knows jesus very well maybe better than anybody else on the planet but still the desire of his heart just like moses said i want to see your face i want more of you paul said the goal of my life is to know him and i want to know the fellowship of his sufferings that i might be more conformed to be the more and i want to know the power of his resurrection in my life and i want to lay hold of that for which i was laid hold of by jesus christ he laid hold of me he's talking about his damascus road experience so that i might be like him and i'm not there yet i'm not perfect you know i don't usually have to tell people i'm not perfect yet we didn't ask we knew that paul has to tell you i'm not i haven't arrived i'm not there but this one thing i do i forget what lies behind and i press on for the upward call of god in jesus christ my goal is to become complete and perfect in christ put this down biblical holiness leads to biblical happiness we jot down psalm 144 happy is that people that is in such a case yea happy is that people whose god is the lord now sometimes you hear christians talking about happiness it's like ah i don't believe in happiness happiness that's the worldly i believe i got joy now why does it look like you've been baptized in lemon juice may i say the bible says happy is the people whose god is the lord if you don't want to be happy that's up to you frankly i'd like to be happy the bible jesus said blessed are the this is the blessed macharius means to be happy but you do need to understand there is a difference between the happiness that the world talks about the word happiness in the english comes from the word hap as in chance happenstance in other words just favorable circumstances fortuitous circumstances in my life that make me happy but that's not the biblical concept of happiness at all rather the concept of happiness in the bible is the favor of almighty the declaration of independence in our gives you the absolute right to life liberty and not happiness oh just the pursuit of it it gives you the right to life and liberty and the pursuit of happiness those are declared as unalienable rights it gives you the right to pursue happiness but it can grant you no promise that you can ever attain it", "but you need to see that biblically happiness is tied with god being god this is an absolute non-negotiable irrefutable spiritual principle god wants us to be holy that's our goal that's his because he's holy he wants us to reflect his character and he commands us to be because he knows what will ultimately fulfill us make us like him and ultimately actually bring us that favor no good thing will he withhold from him who walks uprightly the bible says now we're saved by grace not because we've earned it but god wants to pour blessings on your life read the testimony of a contended sheep that's psalm 23 surely goodness and mercy will follow me all the days of my life and i'll dwell in the house of the lord forever and my cup well it's overflowing can i tell you that god clearly says to abram and i believe to everybody else of faith he will bless you he wants to bless you but why that he might make you a blessing in other words he wants to pour blessings on your life so that not only you go yeah this is cool but so that you overflow on people around you ever content to be a cup of god's blessing oh just fill me up lord i just like being full fill me to the rim with him no he wants to do more than that he wants you to overflow and be a blessing become a blessing to other my father is glorified when you bear much fruit jesus said and when you bear fruit other people are tasting and seeing the lord is good from your life it's not just for you put this down god's law reveals his holiness god's children reflect god's character but god's law reveals his holiness now you may have noticed it'd be hard not to in verses 3 through 12 there's a real familiar sound to a lot of the commands in this chapter because we've already studied them in at length in exodus 20 and that is the giving of the ten and they are being revisited in our text not in the same order not every single one of them completely laid out but the majority of them are mentioned here so put this down holiness begins at home holiness is to begin at home why do i say that well because that's where he starts look at verse 3 every one of you after saying i am the lord you're to be holy because i'm holy every one of you shall reverence his mother and his father his mother and his father so obviously", "we know that that is number which number in the ten number five we all should strive to honor father and mother that's the way i remembered it anyway number five is to honor your father and mother the first commandment with the promise that it may go well with you all the days of your life and of course as i first learned that probably that's true i realized that when i was not nice to my mom and things didn't go my dad didn't let my life go well you know that it may go well if you you may have many days that was exactly right you know um interesting i want you to be holy and the very first commandment that the holy moses write about has to do with honoring father and mother why well i want to suggest to you this is where we as his people are first to understand anything about holiness we come to understand god's authority in our life and so interesting god although it's number five he puts it here first and i think it's because this is often a kind of some a command that's rationalized away by us and by the way it's not just us it's just man in general even during jesus's day jot down matthew 15 verses two through six listen to what he said well first his uh his accuser said this to him why do your disciples transgress the tradition of the elders they don't wash their hands when they and he answered and said to them and why do you yourselves transgress the commandment of god for the sake of your traditions for god said honor your father and mother and he who speaks evil of father and mother let him be put to but you say whoever shall say to his father or mother anything of mine you might have been helped by has been given to god i've dedicated it to the lord he is not to honor his father or mother and thus you invalidate the word of god for the sake of your tradition very interesting in jesus day people were finding a way to actually even god's people to not obey this commandment but to rationalize that way and we do it in different ways now maybe you get to a place where you say well you know that's for like mother's day and father's day you know isn't it interesting we have a day that's set apart in our culture to do something god commands that we do it was benjamin franklin who said oh is easier to keep holidays than", "one day to remember mom one day to remember that no no it's supposed to be all the time national day of prayer the bible says pray without ceasing we are all about just compartmentalizing i'm gonna give thanks well we're to be thankful all the time you see it's very interesting but with regard to reverencing or giving honor to our mothers and our fathers we start to go well you know that was fine when i was in the house when i was growing up and now i'm i'm grown up you know or they've moved away or maybe they've passed on i mean they've died can i tell you something there is no expiration date on the commitment to honor your father and has nothing to do with whether or not you can email them text them see them soon or not or never again on this planet the command is still to every one of us to honor our father and mother the rest of our lives think of the author of the book that we're reading moses moses's mom and dad are not around by the time he's called into the ministry thing close to a father is a father-in-law right what was his name jethro it's hard for me to say his name without thinking of a different jethro bodine i graduated in sixth grade remember him you don't okay anyway that was a different story but moses had this in his life he married you know his and he took care of his sheep for 40 years he was his boss but remember there's this scene where after god calls moses and he goes to pharaoh and he brings the plagues upon the nation and god breaks the heart of pharaoh and his will and he releases the children of israel and and they come out of of of egypt with all these goods and and wealth and yet there's you know maybe a million and a half so i'm saying up to 3 million people that's a huge number they're moving and and there's problems there's people there's problems and every problem comes into moses and moses was talking to people from the moment he woke up to the moment he probably just exhausted fell asleep in this tent trying to solve people's and jethro comes out to visit him and he sees that moses is getting worn out and he says you know what this thing that you're doing is not good this you're going to completely wipe yourself out this makes absolutely no sense at all he has a big plan for delegation and exactly how he should", "handle it now just put yourself for a moment in moses's sandals this is your father-in-law he used to be wouldn't it have been easy for moses to say and exactly how many burning bushes have you ever had how many times you've been called up into the presence of god almighty spoken face to face and had a meal with talk to me about how close you are to god where were you by the way when all this was happening about us coming out you just kind of showed up i got an opinion of what the way you should be handling this but as the bible says moses was the meekest man on the earth of course moses wrote that so we understand it's but he totally listens to him totally does everything that jethro recommended and god god blesses it and i i guess what i'm just going to tell you is this god is still wanting you to grow and me to grow in our holiness by obeying his commands listen um it's not one of your fillings but just put the word holy somewhere up on your sheet just h-o-l-y right and i'm just gonna suggest four words you can just make that an acrostic if you want four words that are always going to be a component of of growing in holiness the first just write h is i s if you're holy you're set apart for god it's the holy land because it's god's land it's a holy bible because it's his book it's a holy people because they are a people for my own possession you're not holy until you're his okay and you're not born his though he has a right to you you need to give yourself to him you become holy as you're set apart that's h that oh you might write the word obedient well be growing in holiness has to do with growing in our capacity and willingness to obey god when we understand it when we don't when it's easy when it's not it's often not where his we're obedient you might not think holiness and love have anything to do with each other they do we'll talk about it in a minute and then the why is person who's growing in the lord is learning how to yield it is the ultimate you know the yield sign is one of the oddest signs i was a cop for 10 years and i did a lot of traffic people don't really know what to do with yield it's like i get stopped i get i get you know i get green light i", "know how to go i i get red i even get yellow which means floor it right but yield is kind of like hey this one's up to you what do you want to do merging traffic you want to get knocked off the road by the truck you might want to merge and just yield but if you understand the filling of the if you understand how to be filled with the holy spirit a lot of christians who don't but if you've read ephesians 5 18 don't be drunk with wine don't be under the influence of alcohol or anything but be filled with the spirit to be controlled by because you have yielded see when a person gets drunk the booze didn't just you know grab him and shove it down his sprout it didn't probably happen like that he imbibed it he he yielded he smoked it you did something to get there you were part of the process if you are filled with the holy spirit you have to make a choice that you are going to yield to god's and believe that he has a mind to communicate to you and a will for you and his spirit was given to you first corinthians 3 so that you might know the thoughts god has for you and that all who are gods are led by the holy spirit and so yielding of the christian lives that's a momentary encounter with god that's just a big ten high maybe it's a moment by moment releasing of control of your life but holiness has everything to do i believe with all four of those words but it begins at home according to our text put this down give it a rest if you want to grow in holiness give it a rest look at verse 3 again second part of it he says and you shall keep my shabbats i am the lord your god by the way you have that phrase over and over and over again in this chapter i am the lord your god in other words don't forget who's saying this i am your covenant god and i'm the one everything about you i made you and i made you i know what makes you tick i know what makes you ticked i know what how to heal you i know how to help you you're going to need to accept what i'm saying even though it doesn't make sense to your brain at times we need to learn to give it a rest now at this time and most of the time throughout history ancient history for sure all other cultures", "would work seven days a week if you if you could beam yourself back in time in your delorean or whatever and talk to somebody about you know what are you going to do on the weekend that that meant nothing the weekend what is that because there was no such thing of course they worked seven days a week until god instituted the concept of a day off and not just a day off to you need some rest you know take a break it's not just about physical rest and it's holy god made the sabbath day separate from the rest and he rested from his work and it is an important day in terms of renewal physically but really about your relationship with god and by not working to trust god that you're going to have enough because if you're not out working then how i'm going to pay the bills how am i going to feed the kids where you're going to have to trust me by the way just a reminder this command was given to israel now some people always get bugged when i say this but if i'm wrong come show me that i'm wrong the command of the sabbath was given to israel it was never given to gentiles you won't find it given to gentiles in the bible in acts 15 it was never put upon gentile christians to keep the sabbath so there are always gentile christians who are trying to become more hebrew become more jewish they'll be more spiritual if they try to become jewish that is not what god has commanded us to do all of god's commands all of got all of the feasts give us spiritual and this particular one deals with the idea of faith rest and if you've not read the book of hebrews you want to understand sabbath you need to read the book of hebrews god rested on this on the seventh day from his work and there remains a sabbath rest for the people of god now here's the idea that we as gentile believers do have a sabbath but we're not commanded to take of working order to make that this golden special day in our calendar and by the way those christians would say no no no the christian sabbath is sunday it's like well would you just show me where it says that well i watched chariots of fire and that's why earth little won the gold olympics because he took sunday off and he refused to run and god honored it yeah yeah that's not exactly what i'm i'm looking for biblical proof that", "sunday ever became the sabbath it never did sunday has always been day one of the creation order it was a day of work it is in israel today don't try to make be the biblical sabbath you can't do that that's the day jesus rose from the dead and that's why we gather that's why the early christian did but it wasn't because it was a sabbath that that is a complete misunderstanding of scripture but the command was given to israel not to gentiles and it is fulfilled spiritually in christ's work on the cross so jot down colossians 2 verses 16 and 17. if anybody's trying to get you to obey the sabbath and if you're not going to be blessed you're not really saved you're not very saved unless you do here here's a verse a couple verses you need to remember therefore let no one act as your judge in regard to food or drink or in respect to a festival or a new moon or a sabbath day those things all of which he just mentioned are a mere shadow of what is to come but the substance belongs to jesus christ so there's lots of spiritual lessons for us and physical renewal is certainly one of them jesus said to his disciples in the midst of his busy ministry come apart for by yourselves and rest for a you do need a break you see it's been said if we don't come apart and rest we'll definitely come apart you but there are some people who think that busyness is next to godliness and the old protestant work ethic you know i i've heard chris say well i don't the devil never takes a vacation what a great role model you got going there we need to you know what psalm 46 10 in the new american sin it says see and know that i'm god king james says be still and know that i'm gone and some of us are moving around so fast and so constantly like frazzled we wonder why can't i find god he's right he's would you slow down i'm right here you need i like psalm 46 10 and the following verse that ends with the word how many of you know what seylab means there's a lot of you that do give it a through moses god said to his people who were freaking out because the army the great armies of the world was about to attack them stand still and see the salvation of god god god sometimes just won't work in your life until you'll stop", "some of us need to learn about sabbath and drawing near to the lord and letting him do a great work and resting well put this down worship the lord in the beauty of holiness that's a direct quote from the psalms but look at verses four do not turn to idols or make for yourself molten gods i am the lord your now when you offer a sacrifice of peace offerings to the lord you shall offer it so that you may be accepted it shall be eaten the same day and the next day so the first two days anything that remains until the third burn it so if it is eaten at all on the it's an offense it will not be accepted every one who eats it will bear his iniquity for he has profaned the holy thing of the lord and that person shall be cut off from his people so a pretty severe thing for not eating it on day you didn't have to do it you still needed to do it the right way i think sometimes people do well i'm just i'm giving this you know i don't get paid for my ministry so i'm just you know it doesn't really kind of can i tell you it matters how you do what you give to the lord even though it's completely voluntary you need to do it unto the lord with the most skill that you can and as honoring as you can be to the lord we're talking about worship here in this in this verse it's an interesting thing in scripture you'll see sinful man from god to idols remember in romans 1 god says um i i my creation testifies that i exist there's nobody who lives on the planet and doesn't know there's a god they may lie to themselves and claim to be agnostic which is a little bit more sophisticated you know i'm just not gonna i just don't know for sure but probably not can't no one knows god says that's just not true you have to suppress the truth in unrighteousness you have to push it down because you don't want to surrender your life to it but god says that he made just jot down romans 1 verses 21-23 here's what god says about sinful man even though they mankind knew god they did not honor him as god or give thanks but they became futile in their questions and their speculations and their foolish heart was darkened professing to be wise they became fools and exchanged the glory of the for an image in the form of corruptable", "man and of birds and four-footed animals and crawling creatures he's talking about idolatry so sinful man turns from god to idols saved man goes exactly the opposite and he turns from idles to god that's first thessalonians 1 and first thessalonians 1 and verse 9. paul says of the church there they themselves report about us what kind of a reception we had with you and how you turn to god from idols to serve a living and a true god now there's a lot of problems with idolatry but very briefly two-fold things two kinds of problems should be very obvious to us first of all when man makes a god even just the statement should be kind of laughable okay god made man in his image but when man makes a god he always does it in his own image whether it's an animal or a a human being and a sculpting or whatever man makes a god and it's always always always less than himself you said it again whenever man makes a god to worship it will always be less himself the second thing about idols is the scriptures are very clear that those who worship idols become like they become like what they worship psalm 115 verses 4 through 8 their idols are silver and gold the work of man's hands they have mouths but can't speak they have eyes but they cannot see they have ears they can't hear they have noses but they have hands but they cannot feel they have feet they can't walk they cannot make a sound with their those who make them will become what everyone who trusts you become like what you worship but man makes a god and it's always not just less than god it's less than even i mean the person who makes the god they have eyes who can say be right but they become like them jot down mark 8 and listen to what jesus said of his generation having eyes do you not see having ears do you not hear and do you not remember in other words these who are not in right relationship to god are becoming spiritually deaf spiritually blind now it's interesting in our text when he's talking about worship not only not turning to idols the first and second commandments no other gods before me and no graven images fellowship let me say that again god's intention is that worship would always fellowship with him and so he says you're to enjoy by the way the peace to actually eat of just offered to god but the offer got to actually partake of", "having a meal with the lord recognizing my relationship with the lord but putting that off putting off participating in it god says no that's not going to work now sometimes it's like this the lord is saying i want a relationship with you but have you noticed he's more interested in having that relationship now i know some of us say yeah i can't wait to be with the lord great but the spirit is willing but the flesh is weak in the song of solomon chapter five we have this picture of the bridegroom and the bride and i love this particular section here's what she says the bride says i was asleep my heart was awake a voice my beloved is knocking the bridegroom's at the door open to me my sister he says my darling my dove my for my head is drenched with dewey's outside my locks with the damp of the night i've taken off my dress this is her response i've taken off my dress another time my pajamas on how can i put it on again i've washed my feet how can i dirty them then so she says basically she hears the knock what does jesus say behold i sit at the door knock if anyone hears my opens the door i'll come in and i'll sup with him i'll have a relationship with and here the bridegroom comes he knocks and she says oh my beloved's at the door it's like yeah you should have come earlier and you're like is this you know oh dark third i gotta get some i'm tired then she says this my beloved extended his hand through the opening of the door and my feelings were aroused for him i arose to open to my beloved and my hands dripped with myrrh and my fingers with on the handles of the bolt i opened to my beloved but my beloved had turned away and had gone my heart went out to him as he spoke i searched for him but i did not find him i called him but he did not answer me you know the bible says seek the lord while he may be found call upon him while he is near the lord wants to have a relationship with you maybe it's in the morning maybe you wake up and say let's be together oh lord i just pushed the snoozer here a few more minutes you know i just not this idea of procrastinating putting off i think is one of the dangers we all have it's like well i do want to", "be with the lord i just it's not right the lord's saying no it needs to happen right now put this down number four let your life be more give and less take more give and less take verses 9 through now when you reap the harvest of your land so it's it's time for the harvest you shall not reap to the corners of your field in other words every last grape every last olive nor shall you gather the gleanings of your harvest the stuff you missed as you went through nor shall you glean your vineyard nor shall you gather the fallen fruit of the of your vineyards leave it there you leave it there for the needy and for the stranger i am the lord your god and then notice verse 11 because it's in this context you shall not steal the command thou shalt not steal but it's in the context of being generous with what you have and seeing what you have is not just being for you here we see something beautiful in the scripture you might say it's the balance which seem to be the two prevailing thoughts of the day when it comes to helping the needy by the way it's interesting in god's the poor had to work i don't know if you noticed that the the grapes of the olives that were left there they were not gathered by anybody given to the poor somewhere the poor had to come get them that that was god's requirements and then all the people that owned the land and the people that benefited from it they would all give glory to god now thou shalt not steal you need to always we study this when we study the ten commandments all the commandments of god even if they're negatives have positive commands as well so thou shalt not steal includes god's direction to purpose and to give to other people i like what corson wrote in this he said when they harvested their fields the israelites were to leave whatever was on the edges for those who were poor rabbinical scholars tell us that this would amount to approximately 15 percent of one's crop this was a wonderful welfare program because food was made available to anyone willing to roll up his sleeves work for it jot down ephesians 4 28 because paul summarizes this in ephesians let him who steals by the way the fact that he says it to a church tells us there's some christian thieves among the these are young baby christians that are still yep let him among you steal no longer", "but rather let him labor performing with his own hands what is good in order that he might have something to share with him who has need you expect him to say let him who steal steel no longer so he'll have all of his that's not what he says no you should work not just to meet your needs but in that and the ability to give what if god's intention for your job isn't just to give you the retirement and to give you food and and to be able to take care of your kids college and whatever what if god's intentional along is to provide enough for you if you manage it right honor him with it that he's going to provide you the ability to always be able to minister and to give to him and to give people to people that are in need proverbs 19 17 he who is gracious to a poor man lends to the lord and he will repay him for his good deed it was henry ward beecher that preacher from the 20th early 20th century who said this what i spent i had what i kept but what i gave have that's right as believers when we give we give to the lord and god will repay number five on your outline since your father never lies god never lies neither should you he after he talks about stealing he says nor shall you deal falsely nor lie to one another you shall not swear falsely by my name so as to profane the name of the lord your god i am the lord jesus said i am the way the alathia the truth and i am the life ephesians 4 25 therefore laying aside falsehood speak truth each one of you with his neighbor for we are members of one another and ephesians 4 15 says speaking the truth in love we are to grow up in all aspects into him who is the head christ we are to be truth tellers that doesn't just mean we don't deceive and we don't lie it certainly means that thou shalt not bear false witness to be like jesus if we're to be like god who is truth then we're to put on the the gospel shoes you see having shot your feet with the preparation of the gospel of peace we are to be truth tellers telling people their sin has been paid for telling them the bad news that they have sinned but the good news that it's been paid for by jesus christ and they need to respond we need to be about that as christians", "to be holy set apart for the lord is to be on a mission and to be completely consumed with the mission that he's called us to we need to tell people the truth and we need to take off our spiritual hush puppies put this down number six don't profane the here in verse 12 i don't know if you noticed it but it talked about profaning the name of god and remember the third i shall not use the name of the lord in vain jesus said to his disciples who said teach us to pray when you pray pray like this and therein in that little short little prayer that you can pray in 30 seconds are a total of seven and i highly commend well jesus convinces you you don't need to take it from me you study the lord's prayer he didn't say pray this prayer he didn't say and if you really mess up do seven of these and uh you know we'll see if everything you know and give you a lollipop and you can you're on your way there was no that that's completely false doctrine he didn't say pray this prayer he said pray so if we ignore the prayer we got a huge mistake for the bible says to him who knows the right thing to do and doesn't do it it's sin so i should be ignoring that prayer i know that prayer i prayed it a few times no no no your prayers should always be in some way shape or another coming back to that prayer and praying about those issues they're can you tell me the very first prayer request of the seven in the lord's hallowed be thy name probably the most misunderstood prayer requests why because it's seen as a description our father who are in heaven hallowed is your name but it's not it's a prayer request let your name be on my lips in my life i want to treat you as holy and i want to see other people treat your name as leviticus 18 21 tells us how important this is to god neither shall you give any of your offspring to offer them to molech that's child sacrifice in the same verse nor shall you profane the name of the lord your god sounds like he's putting two things together that are pretty significant louis t talbot the one for whom they named the seminary that i attended over on biola university who was a 20th a biography was written called for this i was born of his life and in that book these words are written about him", "another place louis louis talbot frequented near the church was a barbershop one day the barber was giving him a shave and had him lying back in the chair he had a warm damp cloth over louie's face then that customer took the lord's name in vain sit me up louie told the barber is anything wrong sir nope just put me up sitting upright removing the cloth from his face he said to that customer my name is louis talbot if you need to use someone's name in profanity use my name but don't you ever again profane the name of my savior and the savior of that my mother loved the lord jesus christ died on calvary's cross for your sins and for mine and brother don't you ever take his name in vain again in my then he had him laid him back down now i don't know how that would go today he'd probably be a fight but i think what a neat spirit you know and you don't have to take that approach but the fact is the name of the lord is being profaned over like john carson's approach when he goes to the gym he said when he's uh in the locker room he he would hear this guy just you know jesus just you know using the name of the lord and vader and he would say oh you know him too isn't he wonderful and he would just you know and start a guy would just look at him like this and he would start sharing the gospel with him so different approaches for different people but i'd suggest you say lord i don't want to use your name i don't want my kids going around saying go good you reverence the name put this down letter c god's love reduces our need for any and any too long of a service so i'm going to stop there we'll come back and we will talk about verses 13 through 18 come i want to get you guys out of here on time let's all stand let's all stand here's what i want to you to take away i want the i want this to be the rain if you will the lord can take any one of those subjects in your life but i want you to ask yourself these growing in holiness not me about bob you am i growing in holiness am i do i know that i'm his and do i declare that am i grateful that not only jesus died on the cross for me but i've dedicated my life", "to him i want to be his totally locked stocking barrel sold out am i being obedient to the commands that i know in scripture not do i have an appetite for him not do i like going to church not do i love singing about god and what he's done for me but am i willing to obey him and if that causes a rub like yeah well there's this one area the lord wants to minister to you and that if you want to grow in holiness you're going to have to deal with the areas you're not being obedient let him who steals okay obviously there's somebody here that needs to hear right when paul's writing it love we'll talk about next time how love has anything to do with the law it's an amazing thing but yielding is self-explanatory though not easy to do i don't like to heal when my brother i had one brother he was eight years bigger than me we shared a bedroom he would get me down on the ground and he was stronger so he could hold me and he would say you need to say i give that's i'm not saying he said you better say i give up meanwhile he's smacking me around say i give up i'll keep smacking he let go of me i would attack him right a lot of us go from moment of surrender to moment of surrender with god and in we're not living ill dude oh maybe circumstances come in and we get broken or something happens and it's overwhelming but then there's the rest of our life listen god doesn't want you just to yield because you have to because you can't get through this situation he wants you to decide that this is going to be how you're going to allow his spirit to take more control of your life when there isn't anything pressing when there is no emergency say lord i want to learn how to yield completely because you are worthy of it you deserve it i need it take over my life let's say one last song we'll go one more time now may the lord bless you protect you and keep you may he make his now this is about his presence this is about fellowship may he make his face shine upon you be gracious to you may he lift up his countenance upon you and give you his peace in the name of the father and the son the holy ghost god bless you", "well praise the lord we're glad you've joined us tonight you can have a seat and for those of you watching online we know you're there and we're glad that you're as close as you can be time in the word as well you know i i know that we're we come into a place like this we're used to coming to church and yet we're in a room full of people from all kinds of different backgrounds and that's why i want you to spend time with each other and and i love it when you come out and get to know new people before and after service hard to do so much in the service but very different things you do during the day from each other and different callings that we have just curious just those that we were any uh any homemakers here that you're a just i want to know who's the homemakers we have ladies working at home with your how about uh do we have people in construction doing construction i know my friend here construction work all now this is not an advertisement for getting a room addition to i know we have some cops here but i'm not sure if they want to raise their hand but any law enforce any law enforcement in the room we're grateful for you yeah people called into a professional you're at a desk all day you're doing work for your company sales anybody in sales all right we're glad to have you guys um what else have any well people work any pastors we have some pastors here i know that yeah we have people from all walks of life and i if i didn't hit you it's because i didn't know what to hit but uh we're glad you're all here and we hope you just have a great time with each other it's enjoyable to worship the lord and prepare our hearts we're in leviticus 21 open your bibles to leviticus then the lord said to moses speak to the sons of aaron and say to them no one shall defile himself for a dead person among his people except for his relatives who are nearest to him his mother and his father son his daughter and his brother also for his virgin sister who is near to him because she has had no husband for her he may defile himself he shall not defile himself as a relative by marriage among his people and so profane himself they shall not make any baldness on their heads nor shave off the edges of their beards nor make any cuts in their", "flesh they shall be holy to their god and not profane the name of their god for they present the offerings by fire to the lord the food or the bread of their god so they shall be holy they shall not take a woman who is profaned by harlotry nor shall they take a woman divorced from her husband for he is holy to his god you shall consecrate him therefore for he offers the food of your god he shall be holy to you for i the lord who sanctifies you am holy also the daughter of any priest if she profanes herself by harlotry she profanes her and she shall be burned with fire the priest who is the highest among his brothers on whose head the anointing oil has been poured and who has been consecrated to where the garments is the high priest shall not uncover his head nor tear his clothes nor shall he approach any dead person nor defile himself even for his father or his mother nor shall he go out of the sanctuary nor profane the sanctuary of his god for the consecration of the anointing oil of his god is on him i am the lord he shall take a wife in her virginity a widow or a divorced woman or one who is profaned by harlotry these he may not take but rather he is to marry a virgin of his own people so that he will not profane his seed literally his offspring's children among his people for i i am the lord who sanctifies him father as we delve once again into this book written to the levites written for the priests lord would you give us ice to see what you want to say to us uh here not just about them but about you and about us lord we want to see ourselves and our savior in the mirror tonight of your word and you we want to become more like you we want to honor and and not just a church but lord 24 7 with every thought that we have we want to do what the psalmist said may the words of my mouth and the meditations of my heart be acceptable to you god may we live before you in such a way that you can use us for your glory so teach us tonight in jesus name amen book of leviticus really written for those in the priesthood now we know that originally god had intended that his whole all of his people would be priests they would be a nation of priests but because of their compromise", "mount sinai in the worshipping of the golden calves that was not going to be and instead one tribe would be elevated among the 12 tribes and be the descendants of levi who would become the priestly tribe responsible for the sacrifices the care and the maintenance and the transportation of the tabernacle and then later of course the temple and so in this chapter we're going to talk a little bit about this role of the it's important god lays out here the qualifications you might say for the priesthood to be maintained and who can who can approach him and and some disqualifiers later on in the chapter leadership in any business in any family and any enterprise certainly in and among god's people uh is key because that person that god is using that human being that god is themselves they're human but besides that they are really a target spiritually speaking when we're talking about god's people here in israel or the uh proverb and a passage of prophecy concerning himself and he did it to tell his disciples that they were all going to forsake him he said tonight you're all going to forsake me of course they didn't believe that remember peter said oh no i'll i'll die but i'll never i'll never forsake you and remember that didn't turn out too well um but but jesus quoted a prophecy that said strike the shepherd and the sheep will and obviously we can tell in that analogy a shepherd is a key leader of the sheep and without the shepherd the sheep are lost they don't know what to do and they are vulnerable and so this principle of the spiritual leadership being uniquely described in this chapter and how god wants them to live is important levites as i said were in charge of the sanctuary of god they also taught the people the word of god they offered the actual sacrifices so they performed the worship on the altar and they were the ones who are called the high priest with the urim and the thumb and the lights and perfection to determine the will of god to hear from god and to kings and the nation in terms of what god wanted his people i want you to think a little bit about yourself tonight in the role of a you're a husband you're a mom you're a friend you've been with the lord you're discipling somebody else or leading somebody in the lord and we're all called to do that but put this down there is a price to be paid to be a spiritual leader", "in the new testament we're told that which in many churches are titles of but churches use them differently sometimes the deacons are in charge of running the church or the finances of a biblically the word deacon just speaks with somebody who's a servant just it's sometimes translated a minister but don't think in the professional vocational sense of a minister you know the white collar it's somebody who's in ministry and so we take it very seriously that anybody in ministry really needs to have the qualifications of a deacon they need to and in both lists uh elder or a deacon you will find both in titus and in timothy the requirement is that they be above what reproach above reproach and there's a number of other qualifications but it's important to see there is a a price to be paid to be a spiritual leader now it's kind of hard for me to think so much about that you know i i think when i became a police officer i could not wait to be a police officer i couldn't believe it when i was in uniform for the first time driving around was the city of la habra and i was working graveyard shift that i was out doing the job of a cop and i you know i wasn't riding with somebody anymore i now was on my own and i just remember thinking man they're paying me to do this this is great i get to go arrest bad guys and chase them and this is great i've been waiting my whole life to do this they don't have to pay i did for a long time they didn't pay me i was a reserve and i did it for free and you know i i just thought it was a privilege a lot of times jobs like that are exciting if you've ever had a job you couldn't wait to do after a while the privilege kind of wears off you know it's like they better pay me uh but uh for a while you're pretty excited you know and and i i do remember uh the other i i didn't think too much there was a price to be paid for for me to get that job it wasn't really just oh i just one day said oh i'd like to get you guys hiring i'll take the job uh there were all kinds of competitive orals that i had to go through an entire actually two police academies that i attended and graduated and had to be qualified to be looked at by a department competitively with other", "officers i had to pay my own way through the police academy because back in the 70s they weren't hiring people and putting them in they they had so many people that wanted to be cops it was easy they just would take the the best they uh they had the choice so it was difficult it took a lot of work physically and academically but um competitively i don't you know i think much financially but there was a price i had to pay but it was well worth it i i never looked back so when i think about there's a price that has to be paid to be in the that's kind of a foreign thought to me because it's all privilege it seems like there's no no real price to be paid but we're going to find out that god has some requirements for those who are going to be used among his people in and living above reproach is what should be true of anybody who's in any ministry becomes a problem with the priesthood i want you to jot down hosea chapter 4 verses 8 and 9. listen to what god says he's not a minor prophet we would have never been called that in his day that just means it's a shorter book in hosea they feed on the sin of my people god said and they direct their desire toward their iniquity and it will be like people notice this so i will punish them for their ways and repay them for their deeds in other words the priesthood has devolved by this time to the point to where they share in the equal punishment with the people of israel there is no distinction now we'll find in this chapter the word defile four times and profane eight um this is the problem when the priests stop being holy men that they would lose their ability to represent i think sometimes we really fail to believe what we know um when i was still a police and a pastor i was teaching through the and it was affecting my thinking which it should the word of god should change the way you think and i uh and some guy came flying around the corner european boulevard actually there the s-curve there and uh i got him on radar he was going way too fast so so i got behind him he went up mccormick i think he saw me because he started trying to get away he didn't run but he was hoping i would disappear i didn't on my light on and he he pulled into his", "now there's some kind of a myth that people think i don't know where they get if you make it to your house that is a complete mistake and you don't want to operate that way that's a real foolish thing to them think you can run away or whatever height anyway so he was shocked i think when i pulled into his driveway right after him and i asked him for his driver's license and registration and he immediately began well first of all he said why did you pull me over that's a very typical question to ask a cop because you think somehow they couldn't know anything about your speed or your driving you know that that there's no way and i said well i have you on radar i can show you the radar gun if you want to see it you know well i might need to look at that you know bring that to court see if that's a good model you know or whatever anyway he starts going into this whole thing about you know why aren't i out get arresting bad people you know doing my job and he pays my salary you know he mentioned that and i said you know i could use a race if i didn't say that i thought that i've said that to other people but anyway that day i was just very polite i said i need your driver's license registration but he started yelling and he started cussing me out and mainly because he saw i was writing a ticket and uh so while i called in my location on the radio the dispatcher and other officers heard that somebody's joining cussing and so they sent a backup officer uh i didn't i mean i didn't see a problem but i guess just to be safe which is good so another officer gary showed up stood by his job just to make sure nothing happens this guy just anyway we get done and i hand them in the ticket to sign it rips it up in this car lot i don't care what you do with your tickets your tickets your promise to appear before a judge not me i'm done actually but i said have a nice day oh he hated that he didn't like that anyway i'm walking back to my police car to leave and gary goes i can't believe it i go what he goes you have the patience of a saint because i didn't get mad or anything and i said well i should i am one if you think i was bragging you don't know who you are", "because you know what i was gonna say i didn't when i was gonna have people standing up i was gonna ask if there were any nuns here i'm afraid there's probably not too many then i was going to ask if there were any priests here and most of you would have never stood up but that's a problem because you do not own your calling to see yourself for who you are we're going to study about priests but if you don't see yourself in leviticus the whole point of tonight's message it's talking about you do you know that it's first peter 2 9. if you just want to jot down a verse they don't have it for the wall because i didn't give it to him earlier enough let me just read it first peter 2 9 talking to us believers you believers gentile believers probably peter's talking about you are a chosen race a royal priesthood a holy nation a people for god's own possession we know it says it we believe the theology we would agree to it now if you told us ahead of time you're talking about spiritual priests and ask if there are any priests in the room we would have stood yeah but that's a problem because you don't see yourself as a priest outside of this room and only when i'm talking about it and neither do i and i'm a pastor i want to i want to encourage you to believe that god wants to say something to you because you see people will come up to me sometimes and say especially if they knew i used to be a cop or whatever wow how does it feel you know how'd you how did you enter into the ministry they'll ask me that and that's a weird thing to go from cop to pastor and i can't understand or they'll say things like how does it feel to be in the i want to say to you how does it feel because if you don't see yourself in the ministry again you don't understand how god sees you and i want you to you need to we we need all of you to see your role so receive god's instructions this letter a receive god's instructions for priests revelation chapter 1 verses 4 through 6 john to the seven churches that are in asia grace to you and peace from him who is who was and who has to come and from the seven spirits or the sevenfold spirit who are before his throne from jesus christ the faithful witness the firstborn from the dead and the ruler", "of the kings of the earth to him who loves us and notice this released us from our sins by his blood and he has made us to be what is this next phrase i want you to say it out and priests to his god and father to him be the glory and the dominion forever john's telling us we're already priests you know sometimes people say well what are we going to do in heaven i don't have a lot on that i can tell you in a few minutes if you want to stay afterwards what little i there's a lot i don't know um or what are they going to do like for that thousand year reign i don't know everything about that i know we're going to judge angels that's going to be interesting demons i'm sure not other angels we're going to be given spheres of responsibility or based on our faithfulness i do know that but you know while we're going to rule for the lord and we're going to reign with the lord the bible says we're also going to represent the lord revelation 20 and verse revelation 20 and verse 6 says blessed and holy is the one who has a part in the first resurrection over these the second death has no power but they will priests of god and of christ and will reign with him a thousand years so if you think your priesthood is just some kind of spiritual metaphor for you being a christian on earth right now in this human life you're wrong the priesthood extends and will extend on into the millennium put this down avoid dead defiling yourself for the dead you say what i don't have that problem the beginning of the chapter deals with this we just read it but glance at it verse 1 the lord said to moses speak to the priests that's us that the sons of aaron say to them no one shall defile himself for a dead person among his people except for the immediate relatives and this is talking about the the regular priest hebrews 7 and verse 26 those of you that are taking the notes i mean the verses this is speaking of jesus it was fitting that we should have such a high priest referring to christ holy innocent undefiled separated from sinners and the heavens he's our example now the priest here in the old testament and now the priest stands before the lord on behalf of men that's part of our ministry is to intercede to pray before man on behalf of god for the purpose of proclamation", "and that is also our responsibility as in fact the word pontifex many people think of the pope but the word pontifex literally means a bridge and that's what we are called to do as believers who know the lord we are to know him better and make him known we're to make disciples of all the nations we're to bring people into a saving knowledge of jesus christ because we have come into that and we're to share what we've experienced jesus was accused during his earthly ministry of hanging out with sinners remember that bothered the pharisees especially his answer he is he does he is a friend of sinners i'm one sitter who's really glad he is but he said here's why the sick need a physician the problem with a lot of people who are self-righteous is they don't know how sick they are they don't see a need but those people who are sinners are if you will spiritually sick and they're they and i come to them to be a physician so let me just say this the idea for the priest is this if you are with unsaved the spiritually dead in order to see them get saved if that's your purpose great but otherwise it's a problem of compromise for the priest he is not allowed to be around simply because i like hanging out with put this down imitate the lord not a spiritually dead world 5 they shall not make any baldness on their heads nor shave off the edges of their beards nor make any cuts in their flesh all three of these things actually part of the death cult of egypt when somebody would die this was the way they would mourn now listen you do not need a sixth sense to see dead people you just need to have spiritual new life yourself remember jesus said to the man who said well first i got to go bury my father he said let the dead bury the dead i was like well how did i do that no no i'm not physically he's talking about the spiritually dead people let them handle that first priority for you is you come follow me it's more important by the way your dad's not dead yet you're waiting for him to die that's what was happening in that in bore to imitate the lord not a spiritually dead world now in the ancient world and you know this if you studied anything about biblical times in the ancient world grief really had become an art form you know uh when the little girl had", "and uh the synagogue ruler jairus you know was trying to get jesus to come remember the woman with the hemorrhage was interrupting the whole thing and he finally shows by the time jesus gets there the professional mourners are now we don't know much about that right we we don't we don't and we we we hire people to bring us food we hire you know someone to take us to the airport but we don't hire someone to cry at our funeral you know just take it out of my estate i want to are you good at crying you know can you make it look like it's but in the ancient world it was super important you had a lot of people crying when herod died he gave orders that the most prestigious rabbis would be slain in israel actually in jerusalem so that there would be mourning because these guys were well respected he knew nobody was going to mourn for him so he was he gave orders that they'd be killed so people would oh remember when herod died oh everybody was crying literally thankfully the command was never followed through but uh ancient world grief art form okay um god gave real strict rules that seem foreign to us sometimes in the scripture remember when aaron who's the high priest his two sons who were priests died we studied that they devon by you they offered strange fire and then god said to aaron as the high priest you're not to mourn for them you're not to go and be a part of a funeral at all you're not even to go out from the tabernacle and that seems so callous and then also later in the bible ezekiel when god takes his wife he says you're not to grieve he said well that doesn't that doesn't shaving in the head cutting of the beard cutting the flesh i i said it was it was a practice of not knowing the egyptian death cult but really a lot of it was practiced in moab jot down jeremiah 48 verses 37 and 38. for every head is bald and every beard cut short there are gashes on all the hands and sackcloths saccloth on all the loins on all the households or housetops of moab and in the streets there is lamentation this was a practice by the way you see the same kind of thing uh in the prophets of baal we talked about this before upon first kings 18 elijah is having the competition with the 450 prophets of baal and they are trying to get their god's attention", "remember they're cutting themselves also interesting in the man or some would say two men that are demon possessed legion there when jesus comes to gadara man's cutting himself with stones that's really a demonic kind of a thing but it was also a practice when someone would die and that's what this is talking about now the cutting of the hair obviously is symbolic the lord in the old testament because there was something called the nazarite we think of samson who was not a very uh holy man in the way he lived but he was supposed to be from birth he was to be set apart for the lord and there were certain rules of what he could and couldn't do one of them was you're not to touch anything dead no corpse uh i mentioned that on sunday how he killed the lion and then came back and took the honey out of the in a vineyard of all places and i supposed to be in a vineyard broke just about every rule and he really he obviously compromised his relationship with the lord uh his hair was the symbol of that covenant relationship with god and he finally wears down with delilah on the fourth time and tells her it's my hair if they cut my hair i'll lose my strength and that's exactly judges chapter 16 and verse 17 records this do we have that judges 16 well here's what it says so he told her that as samson told delilah all that was in his heart and said to her a razor has never come on my head for i have been a nazarite to god from my mother's womb if i am shaved then my strength will leave me and i shall become weak like other when delilah saw that he had told her all that was in his heart she sent and called the lord the philistines saying come up once more for he has told me all that is in his heart the lords of the philistines came up to her and brought the money in their hands and you know the rest of the story they as uh they weak so this symbol of a relationship with god for the nazarite is in the other cultures they would cut it to express their grief and god says i don't want you to act like the world don't grieve like the world agrees put this down don't profane your priesthood don't profane your priesthood and then the next fill in is the word minister so number one under letter b stay clean because you minister to the", "lord now i want you to jot down psalm 24 verses 3 through 6 this is where my title comes from here's what david says in psalm 24 who may ascend to the hill of the lord and the hill of the lord is and where the temple mount is and who may stand in his holy place he who has clean hands and a pure heart who has not lifted up his soul to falsehood and has not sworn deceitfully he shall receive a blessing from the lord and righteousness from the god of his salvation this is the generation of those who seek him who seek thy face i remember being in a pastor's conference some years ago senior pastors for calvary chapels from all over actually the world so there were 800 to a thousand just just the senior pastors we weren't allowed to take our staff and i'll never forget the excellent teacher of the bible and very funny uh guy but very good teacher and he said something that i'll never forget to these pastors in the room he said this the lord knew that some of you guys here would never read or study the bible if you weren't a pastor so that's why he called you into the because he knew you wouldn't be in the and and people laugh kind of like some of you just did because some guys felt like yeah that's right that might be true what a tragedy though to think that a guy's only the ministry only in the word only teaching a lot it's my job you know and i if i didn't i just wouldn't even read pastor who was stating that himself would fall from his purity and his marriage and lose isn't in the ministry at all today god doesn't say you must stay holy because people are watching you as you minister to my people he says you need to stay holy because you minister this is about me and you if it's genuine and authentic it's not because it's something you do because it looks good or because it makes you feel you got to stay holy that's how you the church will let you do something it's because you love god because you want to be pure before a holy god put this down marriage is to be a picture of the lord's purity and the priest is called to represent that in verse 7 they the priest shall not take a woman who is profaned by harlotry so not a prostitute nor shall they take a woman divorced from her husband", "and the reason is he's holy to his god you shall consecrate the priest for he offers the food of the bread of god he shall be holy to you for i the lord who sanctifies you am holy then look down in verse 13 through 15 he shall take a wife in her virginity a widow or a divorced woman again or one who is profaned by heart of the tree these may he may not take but rather he is to marry a virgin of his own people so that he will not offspring among his people for the lord we know this we we know that forgiveness clearly extends to the immoral praise god a lot of us would not be here as believers if god's forgiven i mean woman at the well john 8 the woman caught in the very act of adultery and every other immorality you can imagine and god's redemption certainly extends to a person who has been divorced god can there's a lot of people who have who are the innocent uh victims of someone who has divorced them not you know for infidelity but incompatibility or whatever the priest is to be a reflection of the lord's fiancee if you will is a is pictured as a chaste virgin in the bible second corinthians 11 and verse 2. and by the way that's you as part of the church paul said i am jealous for you with a godly jealousy for i betrothed you engaged you to one husband that is to christ that i may present you as a pure virgin that is what the church is godly marriage with godly children is this fortress from which god's servant can go forth and do battle that's the idea and if we want to keep god's blessing on our ministries we have to keep ourselves and our marriages and our families dedicated to the lord best we can so the priest in the scriptures is a type of christ who marries a bride listen to me who has been cleansed before marrying him that's right our past background not so clean in terms of this list but because of christ things have changed that's ephesians 5 25-26 remember we don't marry jesus until we're in heaven but here's what it says husbands love your wives as christ loved the church gave himself up for her that he might sanctify her having cleansed her by the washing of water with the word that he might present to himself the church in all her glory having no spot or wrinkle or any such thing but that she", "should be holy and blameless the church is cleansed by christ we didn't come this way before we became his bride but he cleansed us and by the way now we have no spot or wrinkle which is exactly what he does not have he the lamb of god could have no spot or wrinkle it could have no spot or blemish to be acceptable to god we share his righteousness is the idea not because we were born that way or because we've acted that way on our own but by faith we've been granted that privilege of sharing his standing with now number three kids can hurt your ministry and burn their own legacy says the daughter of any priest if she profanes herself by harlotry she profanes her father she shall be burned fire now this verse kind of troubles people and i don't blame them seems rather harsh but here's what it's i think saying if a daughter of a priest becomes a first of all we should notice this the priest does not lose his ministry the daughter loses her life so let's notice that to begin with in deuteronomy 22 and verse 21 we are god's sentence for harlotry deuteronomy 22 21 states very clearly that the person committing the harlotry the man and the woman are to be stoned what this appears to be teaching is this that she would be stoned to death it doesn't say that but that is the then her body would be burned afterwards that is apparently what's happening by the way that's exactly what they did with aiken and his family who took the things under the ban during the battle of jericho they were stoned to death and then they were burned now burning is not a common though we think of cremation is very common and i don't think there's any issues for god's people today about that there are those who do i don't see any sin in for for the for the israelites the burning of a body meant there was no body to honor and no memorial no legacy left uh having a decent burial was like super important read the book of ecclesiastes it doesn't matter if you live a long life have a zillion kids and very successful if you don't have a good burial what's the point that's what he basically says like well really because your burial your funeral is where your value is ultimately seen for what your life was worth is the idea so prostituting daughter is is burned kind of like just like trash basically and tragedy by the way um eli", "in the book of first samuel he's the high priest he has two sons and uh hoffney and fenes and they are men they are sons of belial which means they they didn't know the lord but they're in the ministry because their dad is high priest so a little nepotism going on there they didn't spiritually qualify at all and god will ultimately take them out and by the way he'll take eli out for not really reproving them because they were committing sexual sins and stealing from the people even samuel himself who was a prophet of a priest of god godly man his own sons when he gets older they're not like that and they're not spiritual men but they also are are in the ministry and so that's when the nation says you know we don't want your sons to to to rule over us the way you did you know give us a king that's when it happened when when his sons were not spiritual principle in the new testament first timothy 3 verses 4 and 5 which says this the elder must be one who manages his own house well keeping his children under control with all dignity but if a man does not know how to manage his own house or his own family how will he take care of the church of god so if your kids are out of control it can disqualify you from representing the lord and ministry spiritual obedience takes priority over verse 10 and 11 verse 10 says the priest who is the highest among his brother so the high priest on whose head the anointing oil has been poured and who has been consecrated to where the garments shall not uncover his head nor tear his clothes nor shall he approach any dead person nor to file himself notice even for his father or his mother nor shall he even go out of the sanctuary if they die nor profane the sanctuary of his god for the consecration of the anointing oil is on him i am the lord now do you remember i kind of mentioned it earlier the tribe was to become the priests what was it that the levites did that granted them that role anybody remember yeah casey it's the basis of that great hymn who is on the lord's side remember if you've ever anyway some of us grew up in japan how many of you know that him who is on the lord's side okay five well that's right uh you don't need to know the hymn yes you know your bible yes uh", "god with moses 40 days 40 nights giving them the law interrupts it says go down they've you know they've defiled themselves and aaron's taking the lead with the golden calf and they're involved in not only immorality but idolatry which always go together in the bible and he comes down and uh the people are just out of big orgy going on just complete out of control and so he says who is on the and uh the sons of levi were the ones and evidently were not involved with the sin and he says basically i'll get your armor every man put on a sword now go through the camp and don't spare anybody i don't care if they're your own personal family if they're involved with this you take them out and they did and as a result of that decision to put the lord before even their closest family affection god said you're going to be my priests from that point on and that is really what this is talking about you will at the hyper you're not to even leave the sanctuary you're not to go and grieve and you're not even even for your own family deuteronomy 33 verses 8 through 10 and of levi he said now this is in later years they're talking back deuteronomy second giving of the law looking back on how levi got chosen and of levi he said let thy thumman and thy urim those are the lights and perfection these dice or these lots that were used to discern the will of god thy thummin and thy urem belong to thy godly man whom thou this prove at massa with whom thou this contend at the waters of maraba who said of his father and his mother i did not consider them and he did not acknowledge his brothers nor did he regard his own sons for they observed thy word and they kept thy covenant they shall teach thine ordinances to jacob and thy law to israel they shall put in since they'll have the role of being the this corresponds with something jesus talks about in the gospels matthew 10 and verse 37 he said this and this verse bothers a lot of people he who loves father or mother more than me is not worthy of me and he who loves his son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me so the idea if we were to break it down for us is this don't even for your family don't compromise your faith even for your husband your wife your children the lord has to be", "adam decided to take of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil given to him by his wife and disobey god and the rest is literally history all of history but the idea of grieving being such an important thing that they that they wanted to show their value of their family and say you're not going to even do that if uh i take someone home shut down first thessalonians 4 and verse 13. we know this with regard um this teaching about the rapture but he starts it out by saying this we don't want you to be uninformed brethren about those who are asleep that you may not grieve as do the rest to have no hope now he's going to talk about the hope of the rapture and the fact that we'll be reunited but he's saying this believers are not to grieve the way unbelievers grieve now it's not a sin some christians think it's a sin to grieve at all we should just be happy that is not jesus wept at the funeral that you're wrong about that you you um did the person mean anything to you of course you should grieve i mean i'd grieve if a friend of mine some friend of mine moved away last week and and i i was sad to see him go there's nothing wrong with grieving when in fact i say this if it's easy for you to leave the church if you've been there over a year or something's not right i say it should feel like velcro ripping you should be in connected with each other if it doesn't then what was that all about but the point i'm trying to make is not a sin to grieve but we don't grieve as the rest to have no meaning the world they have that's it it's over we're they have no hope of the resurrection so the idea for the high priest and really we can take something to ourselves here is even in our grief we should seek to glorify god by the way it's interesting it says that the high priest was not to rend or tear his garment tearing the garment was a symbolic gesture of grief the idea is you tore your you actually had very down to a science of where you tore how much you tore depending on your relative it specific wasn't like ah it was just you would tear certain places for certain things and the idea was you're doing something on the outer garment to express your inner grief okay but the high priest was not allowed to", "rend or tear his garment which is interesting to me because guess who does exactly that caiaphas does at jesus trial disqualifying him by the way from being the high priest he had no right to do that but he violated the law when he did that the high priest is not to be given to emotional hope and pray that you believe really genuinely believe that your saved friends and family are actually really very much alive right i was with a sister from our church who will be dying very soon and she knows it fine with it so i went to say goodbye and uh to pray with her just a couple weeks ago and we were having this conversation and i asked her how she felt about all that and she said i can't wait i said tell me why she said cause i i'm gonna see jesus's face and i can't wait to see my savior's face and i thought i said that's awesome and then i said something to her i don't think she expected i said will you do me a favor when you get there she was like nobody else has asked me for that so she said sure but if i can i said well i don't need you to tell jesus anything for me because i can do that myself i'm good there i said but if you have the freedom and if he's love you to look up my dad so i told her his name said i think you'll remember it if your brain's working the way i think it's gonna work and i said just tell him i said hi and i'll see him soon and she said you know what if i can do that i'll do that see i think it's good to talk to people who are believers who are about to go to heaven because they're really going to a real place where real things are going to happen and i think sometimes we just pretend oh no that's not really going to happen that's all fairy tale stuff no it's not we're really going to a real place and to be absent from the bodies to be present with christ and we're going to be with those brothers and sisters certainly at the rapture we'll be with them but the fact is there were jews in jesus day who did not believe that there were leaders in fact they were in charge by the way of the temple sometimes we think pharisees sadducees they're all the same that no they were totally different they were liberals and conservatives and the pharisees were", "very very they were more than conservative they were legalists and the sadducees were the liberals but they ruled the temple they had the and um they were in cahoots with the the sadducees distinctly did not believe the whole bible just like a lot of liberals today pick and choose what i believe they're they're picking and choosing if mo wrote it if moses wrote it we believe it that's from god everything else nope so we don't believe in other stuff we don't believe in angels we don't believe in demons we don't believe in resurrection from the dead they didn't believe there was an afterlife that's why they were sad you see that's the the fact is they didn't believe that at all so they come to challenge jesus well if there's a resurrection which we don't believe in and there was this guy and his wife and he died seven husbands they had this whole riddle to give jesus it was just to try to trick him didn't make any sense at all and he didn't have any trouble with it either he said you air knowing neither the scriptures nor the power of god and then from the books that they the first five the pentateuch because those were moses written those were from he says you remember how god introduced himself to moses at the burning bush exodus 3 14. remember how i am the god of who now they already knew that verse what was jesus pointing out the fact that jesus said i am i used to be long time ago by the time moses is alive they are long since dead and jesus said he didn't say i used to be i was the god of abraham isaac and jacob but i'd like to know you nice to meet you moe he didn't say i was he said i am and then jesus made the point for god is the god of the living and not the dead in other words in your own bible the moses that you accept said it he was their god right now long after they died and they didn't want to ask him any more questions i wouldn't have either if i was them that was pretty clear from their own bible that they had misunderstood the word of god i don't know about you but the longer i'm alive as a christian the more people i know up there than down here i really do did write some a couple years ago now a little thing i wrote everybody that i knew that was a believer that had died", "in my life that was fair fairly and then at the end i just wrote um i know i wasn't writing it to them i don't have any reason i think they're reading my facebook posts i like that one but anyway um i just wrote looking forward to getting caught up because i am i'm looking forward to being with you again and it's going to happen at the rapture but anyway put this down stay in the place of total consecration verse 12. you're a priest this is for you and me verse 12 nor shall he the priest go out of the sanctuary nor profane the sanctuary of his god for the consecration of the anointing oil of his god is on him in other words we're to stay in that holy place the priest the high priest was always on duty that's why he couldn't go out to a funeral second timothy 2 and verse 4 paul said it this way to us as believers no soldier in active service entangles himself in the affairs of everyday life so that he might please the one who enlisted him as a soldier we're on a mission we have we are to be 24 7 connected with the lord and not to be distracted from um and so this idea of grieving even for our loved ones i like what john corson said about this and john corson pastor john course and applegate fellowship many of you know wife died in a car accident and his daughter died in a car accident very similar on hitting black ice and alive and then dead and he had to grieve each one of those but a very interesting thing he said happened he said he got a lot of advice from people when it happened when he went through it who said you need to take some time off go go go spend some time at the mountains they applegate has a retreat center go be alone with the lord and and and grieve and and and heal and he said these people all meant well they said when his wife died they said it when his daughter died jesse and uh you know what he didn't in either case he didn't feel led to do it he felt led he was back in the pulpit three days later preaching and ministering and people couldn't understand how he is convinced that it was the wrong advice that god's calling on his life and he believes for believers it gives them the enemy a lot of times a chance to work stay in the ministry stay", "very interesting and he's somebody who's gone through it speaking about this he really believes that so very fascinating a holy person doesn't just merely work in a holy place or or talk about holy things or perform holy tasks it has to do with who they are all the time listen to this before the colonialists impose national boundaries the king the kings of laos and vietnam those two countries reached an agreement on taxation in the border those people who ate short grain rice built their houses on stilts and with indian style serpents were on the other hand those who ate long grain rice built their houses on the ground and decorated them with chinese-style dragons were considered for taxes the exact location of a person's home was not what determined his or her nationality instead each person belonged to the kingdom whose cultural values he or she exhibited writer says that so it is with us as believers we live in the world but as part of god's kingdom we're to live according to his kingdom's standards and values we are told that our citizenship is in heaven in the book of philippians and it's all about how you live not where you live not just at church or with christians but all the time put this down literacy we are to reflect christ's purity and his grace in the second half of the chapter beginning in verse 16 we have some of the disqualifying uh things from being a priest verse 16 then the lord spoke to moses saying speak to aaron and say no man of your offspring throughout their generations who has a defect shall approach to offer the food of his god for no one who has a defect shall approach that he lists them a blind man a lame man he who has a disfigured face a king james has a flat or any deformed limb king james says or something superfluous some some growth or a man who has a broken foot a broken hand a hunchback or a dwarf or one who has a defect in his eye or eczema or scabs or crushed no man among the descendants of aaron the priest who has a defect is to come fire since he has a defect he shall not come near to offer the food of his god he may eat the food of his god both of the most holy he's still a levite he can receive of the most holy only he shall not go in to the veil or come near to the altar because he has a defect so that he will", "not profane my sanctuaries for i am the lord who sanctifies them so moses spoke to aaron and to his sons and to all the well put this down many are disqualified to represent the lord according to this if we look at the list if they're blind bible says where there is no vision lame this person must be able to walk the walk with the lord disfigured face no flat nose this is a person that needs to be able to have their sense they need to be able to to sniff out false doctrine you might no broken footed they need to be able to take a stand not broken-handed they need to be willing and able to reach out unlike the priest in luke 10 the good samaritan who walked across the street on the other side and refused to reach they cannot have a crooked back they need to have a backbone unlike pilate who refused to take a position on christ remember he washed his hands cannot be a dwarf they must be growing you might say in their faith can't have a defect in their eye they have to have a correct perspective always speaking the truth and jesus was that person who deferred to no man he could see when somebody was having a problem the rich young ruler who said i've obeyed the ten commandments and jesus said really then go sell all you have he could see right through to the was really true he was covetous eczema or scabbed not a person who's no crushed testicles this has to be a person who's able to there's an old saying evangelize or you and the spiritual leader has to be someone not just who knows theology but are able to reproduce now someone has taken these very things and they need to have perfect vision well that's certainly true of jesus jesus sees the future on the mount of olives as he's coming in on palm sunday he can tell them what's going to happen 40 years in the future when titus the roman comes when they asked him what's to be the sign of your coming and the sign of these things he can describe to them very specifically he sees exactly what's going to happen they cannot be lame interesting the bible says that john the baptist looked at jesus as he walked and said behold the lamb of god who takes away the sin of the world that is the a righteous man the bible says we ought to walk as he walked the one who says he abideth live that righteous life he had perfect", "no deformed limb or nothing superfluous if you think about it jesus had he added nothing to to the scriptures he took the law and he actually simplified them all the commandments hang on these two love god and love your neighbor as yourself nothing superfluous sure-footed remember when the soldiers came to jesus in the garden of gethsemane and he said whom do you seek and they said jesus the nazarene and what did jesus say hey go amy i am and at the words i am right from exodus 3 14 power knocked down almost like dominoes those soldiers but jesus stood firm in front of that he stretched out his hand to heal the leper and to bless the children and to save peter who was sinking in the sea of galilee he had a spine all right he spoke truth to power would tell the pharisees they were full of dead men's bones jesus was no dwarf spiritually he left giant footsteps that were told by peter we've been studying it on sunday mornings that were to walk in his in his steps and on and on everything about this high priest is perfectly can reproduce here's what jesus said except a grain of wheat falls of the earth and diet remains alone but if it it'll bear much fruit and if you read even though jesus was never married and he never had physical children he has so many offspring and we're sitting right now in this room we are children of god by faith in him and it talks about his offspring he'll see it and we'll be glad and that's that's our lord jesus he is our faithful high so many are disqualified to represent the lord but put this down finally god doesn't call the qualified he qualifies and and if you would colossians chapter 1 and verse 12 is the last verse i want you to put down tonight colossians 1 12 paul says we give thanks to the father who has qualified us to share in the inheritance of the holy ones in light that's who we are we have been qualified by him now all of us in this room who are christians were representing the lord at all but in christ we are not only called but we're qualified as priests the bible physical defects or in other defects don't stop god from using us because the lord can redeem them and there are ample examples just in this room and certainly from christian history fanny crosby was blind since she was a little girl george mathison the great hymn writer was also blind amy carmichael directed ministry", "from a sick bed in india charles hadn't spurgeon you might not know this would leave london and winter in south france just to get his health restored physical handicaps while they're a burden to bear are no barrier to christian service we're willing to wholly depend on the lord paul's thorn in the flesh is as he wanted it removed and the lord said no it's best that you keep it it'll keep you humble my grace is sufficient you've heard the brother who we had here room was reversed no arms no legs no nick came and i've never seen more people come to faith in christ at an altar call in our church in our history god's using him powerfully or david ring maybe you have heard of who had had cerebral palsy since he was a little guy you can hardly understand everything he says but he all through his message he said i have cerebral palsy and i go and preach to everybody what's your excuse that's his line and uh it's a good question to ask but even if you were disqualified from the ministry for some reason you're still qualified to receive from he still wants to minister to you one of the things that i love about the lord is how he takes and he uses ashes for beauty and i not just that he can do that but he's doing that in in our lives the bride in the song of solomon her glory is described as the glory of the moon if you want to dot it down i guess we do have one more verse song of solomon chapter 6 and verse 10. here's what it says who is this that grows like the dawn as beautiful as the full moon as pure as the sun as awesome as an army with banners you guys see the full moon the other night oh man it was it was huge it was phenomenal just what about a week ago here's what jesus said well here's what god said in the book of genesis i'm creating two lights the greater light to rule the day lesser light to rule the night the sun and the moon for signs and seasons jesus when he was in his ministry said i am the light of the world he is the son nothing is hidden from his heat his his witness goes throughout the whole circuit of the earth that's psalm 19. but jesus then said to his disciples i'm night's coming when no man can work but you're the light of the world there's the greater light", "and if you will the followers of jesus i believe are the lesser light now compared to the sun the moon on its own is just dark and damaged and really when it comes to but because of the glory of the sun the moon can still reflect the glorious light of the sun to a dark world it's nothing within us it's because of our relationship to him that he can take even us who are dead and damaged and dark and we've got a history and it's sunlight that reflects off of the moon nothing of itself to a darker world amen for some reason this hymn came to my mind because it's true in my life his love has no limits his grace has no measure his power no boundary known unto men for out of his riches in jesus he giveth and giveth and that's the business he's in is redemption and i'm just glad to be one that he's still redeeming amen would you bow with me would you give us the grace to believe that we're saints and not just to believe it biblically but to own it to claim the title lord would you give us the grace tonight to say i a priest of the most high god i would never have qualified i would have never even have offered or myself or my resume for the job i'm not qualified to represent the living god but by grace by your by your kindness to me you have taken me and cleansed me you have bestowed upon me your glory like the sun does to the moon and you want me to shine to a dark world and you want me to represent you then i will own i am because of your grace toward me the priest of jesus christ and i will as best i can i will speak for you i will pray on their behalf to you and i pray lord you would use me for your and i would honor you in jesus name amen let's all stand and sing together would you just allow the lord's blessing to be upon you believe that the lord's is on you you say well i've never been anointed with oil no you've been anointed by the person of the holy spirit you say well i don't understand about the garments of a priest you have been guarded in the beauty of righteousness the very righteousness of jesus christ there is no greater garment you have been ordained by the lord to bear fruit and that it might remain he said to his disciples i send you", "forth as the father has sent me would you accept that role and say lord would you use me in ways that i didn't think were maybe tonight it's going to be on the way out to say to someone who's going to share a need to say i'm no more spiritual than you are but could we talk to the lord you have the privilege of a direct line to god you're his priest and his priestesses would you allow the lord to use you to intercede to speak truth to proclaim truth to people that are hurting and lost because they're all around us may the lord bless you may he use you the prayer room's open if you need prayer but may god use you in power this week god bless", "which never returns void amen all right lord we look forward to worshiping you now thank you for paying the ultimate price but also meeting us here now because you are alive and we believe it we would not be here

me there in the promised land this is a first timers if you're wondering what that means it means we're we're considering doing a second timers tour again there are many people how many of you have ever been to a lot of people in this church been there some of you can't raise your hand this is for you if you have been and you want to come back i don't blame you i've been 25 times it never gets old so if you want to go again we'd love you to join us but please take advantage on our app and get the info and then though to hebrews chapter 12 as we get back into the book we're going", "verse by verse through hebrews 12 today verses 14 through 17. beginning in verse 14 the writer says peace with all men and the without which no one will see the lord or see to it that no one comes short of the grace of god and no root of bitterness springing up causes and by it many be defiled that there be no immoral or godless person like esau how would you like your name in the yeah like esau who sold his own birthright for a single meal for you know that even afterwards when he desired to inherit the blessing he was rejected for he found no place though he sought it with tears father how it's our desire to come to church and start out the new week in the presence of well you lord to remind ourselves that you're alive that you've already died for us jesus you've risen from the dead you've made promises to come back the lord in between now and that moment of our death or your return we want to live in a way that honors you more and more we want to grow to become more like lord we want to learn to run this race so that at the end we can say we have fought the good fight we have course and we with paul can know that there is laid up for us in heaven a crown of eternal righteousness so lord would you encourage us and equip us today to run the way you want us to run in amen you can be seated we are in the more practical part of the book of hebrews how do we take what christ has done for us and allow it to affect us and remember the imagery in the background here is that there are many who have run the race before us and of course jesus is our ultimate example but they went to the old testament to see men and women of faith who lived out their faith in all kinds of ways and now we're being instructed how does that work in our lives and he comes to a section dealing with our relationship with each other and our relationship with the lord so i i've called it in pursuit because that's what it says in my text here that we are to pursue two things uh the one is peace so you can jot that down pursue peace with people you know um every police officer who goes through a police academy is about uh code three driving and particularly pursuit driving because it's dangerous one of the things", "when you are a police officer and go into pursuit while it's very exciting is the tendency to not see everything very well it's called tunnel vision and as your adrenaline runs and you're very very laser focused on the person you're trying to apprehend you can tend to miss other things and actually become a problem so you have to how to drive or at least try to learn how to drive with all that excitement well this word that is used in our text is a word that literally means to chase after to run after it's a word that he's relating to the fact that we're running this race faithfully to the end but the idea here is that there are some priorities in our life that we are willing to chase after and the first one that he mentions is peace with other people i want you to jot down psalm 34 and verse 14 psalm 34 and verse 14. depart from evil do good seek peace and pursue it now here's the truth is the bible tells us that's not always possible with certain people and as i talked this morning about this some of you are going to have people's faces come up on your rolodex in your mind like yeah that's one of those i'm sure of it hopefully you're not coming up on somebody else's rolodex but put this not always possible is no excuse to not pursue it let me say that again that it's not always possible to be at peace with somebody is not an excuse to not obey this command and i want you to jot down and verse 18. this is where we get this verse which says this if possible so far as it depends on you be at peace with all men interesting many of you have heard the name jonathan edwards how god used him in the great awakening here in the united states in the 18th century man of god but you might not know that he had a that fell in love with a man and the man came to jonathan edwards asking if he could have his daughter's hand in and he said no he said no why not he said she she's not worthy he said what do you mean she's a christian isn't she he said yeah he said well i'm a christian what do you mean she's not worthy of me we're in love with each other he said it might be so but she's not worthy of you and he said the grace of god can live with some people that other people can't live with", "the answer is no he didn't let him marry there are some people that well you're never going to really be able to have peace with them by the way i've noticed this in scripture i'm sure you have too the devil is an expert at using god's word to tempt us to avoid doing god's will he's an expert at taking the very word and using us using it to help us not obey or to be tempted not to obey the will of god you see that in the garden right of eden the devil's happy to quote the word of god to eve or for that matter to jesus throw yourself down from the pinnacle for he himself hath said he quote psalms god will give his angels charge be careful that you don't use scripture as a basis for not obeying scripture i've seen that happen before well happy are the people whose god is the lord and jesus came that i might have an abundant life and i'm not happy in my marriage so i'm getting a divorce be careful you don't take the word of god and use it as an excuse to disobey the will of god now we've all met somebody along the way or somebodies who could easily replace grumpy in the seven dwarves if he ever retires uh there are plenty of those people and some just seem to be that way maybe it's because they're jaded or who knows what the story is behind it it's like that person that said to the lady have a nice day and she said i have other plans you know oh well god is not tasking you or me with making an irreconcilable person reconcilable that's not up to you but he is tasking us as believers with going after it and not coming to inclusion well there's no way that will ever work that i've given up on that person i don't have to do it no listen when i was a police officer if i was working radar and somebody came over the hill at 120 miles an hour i'd go wow i'll never catch him i'll just wait for somebody going 70. no no no my job is to go after them not well can i it's not up to you it's not up to me too often that's when we share the gospel of them see if they're open bible doesn't share the gospel with people that are open the seed goes everywhere right something's going to be on the wayside it's not going to ever you know we're not to be soil analyzers", "we're to be seed casters amen that's our job we're going to be questioning about our faithfulness if your brother's sin is going to improve them in private it doesn't say if you feel like it do you think they'll receive it we're not giving any of that we're just giving a command we are to peace and pursuing has to do with an intentional focus intending as best we can to arrive at goal well put this down number two are we given a pass on unbelievers if you look at the text it's pretty pursue peace with all men you go well does it include women no it just actually the word men is even in the original just with all so it's not okay if you say well i'm at odds with my heathen boss or my pagan neighbor it says all men actually are all people and i've checked just to be sure what that word all means in the greek and guess what yeah it includes them all is all that means i i believe and this is true that most attempts to reconcile with somebody that we're at odds with fail first of all they often fail because they are never attempted to be honest but when we do try to make things right whether it's in your family or among friends or people in the church or whoever it is most attempts to reconcile fail listen to me now because we come to the table willing to forgive but not so much to be forgiven meaning we don't see that we've really done anything that's worthy that needs to be forgiven so if we get there it's like well i'll forgive them you know if they say the right words if they act the right way or because jesus told me i which sometimes just means i'll say i forgive you but i really don't i forgive you but i'll never ever so when we read love does not take into account a wrong suffering we're saying oh jesus thank you but he's saying no i want you to have that kind of love for other people 70 times seven even peter said are you you joking somebody does it two or three times i would say they are a repeat offender three strikes and you're ow you know um put this down bitterness can be a bad reaction to grace it's interesting uh it says here in right in the context of pursuing peace see to it that no one comes short of the grace of god and a root of bitterness spring you know i don't know if you're allergic", "to anything but every time a doctor asks me questions a new doctor just the other day you know had asked me a bunch and they asked are you allergic to anything well i am i'm allergic to and sofa whatever that is and of course i know that because i've taken it and seen the reaction of my body and he asked me how long ago was it i said not long enough i don't have any desire to see if i'm still allergic to it we'll just go with penicillin and sulfur the fact is sometimes it's god's grace in somebody's life that can lead another to becoming bitter toward them not but that is one of the things that happens remember the parable of the where the landowner hires people at the beginning of the day and then he goes down and hires some more day laborers in the middle of the day and then he hires really toward the end of the day you remember how he had promised the first people i'll pay you a day's wage of denarius one day's wage that was fair and he really didn't tell the other people how much he would pay them he don't worry i'll pay you you know good to work for a couple hours but you remember the story at the end of the day the people that got paid first were the ones who had come to work last and he paid them how much a full day's wage so what did that do to the people that had been there all day wow right if he paid those guys and worked an hour a full day's wage i can't wait to change and get my paycheck and how much did he same thing say like what that's not fair he says really what's not fair about it it seems to me our one day's wage i paid you exactly what actually you're accusing me of injustice generous you can become bitter when god is gracious maybe maybe you know somebody and they're getting away with all kinds of stuff and you don't ever do what they do and it irritates you that they're not getting judged that's psalm 73 read about asaph he couldn't handle it that the wicked they had seems like they died fat dumb and happy but they just never got judged but he couldn't get away with nothing and he was mad about it till he realized yeah well let's talk about where they're and he realized oh you know what i see what god's doing think about the story of the prodigal", "son you remember that story how he comes dad receives him but someone doesn't oh yeah the older brother he seems to have a problem with the grace of god being given to the brother you're throwing him a big party and a cow big fattened calf i've never had any barbecue like that i've been good and look at you dude you see where it goes you can become bitter because why are getting the blessings i deserve why do they get it's very easy to do now it's not always god's grace in someone else's life that leads to bitterness hopefully you just celebrate the gods sometimes it's because a person has just gone through a lot of hurt and you know what i know in this room there's a lot of history a lot of hurt from maybe your growing up years with your maybe your marriage maybe your involvement with other christians or people that have hurt you naomi was a woman who wasn't bitter because of the grace of god in somebody naomi was a woman who was bitter how do i know she's better well she changed her name to bitter that's naomi means pleasant she like legally gets it changed too just call me mara which means bitter because i don't want to hear pleasant every time someone calls me claim god has dealt very mara with me i lost my home in bethlehem i lost my and my sons in moab and now i've got nothing to look forward to so pipe down leave me alone that's a beautiful book and if you're a better person read the book of ruth it's it's about grace it's about how god has the power and the desire to change the bitter put this down deal with the root not merely the fruit see to it that no root of bitterness spring up you know we have that expression in english nip it in the bud by the way it's nip it in the bud dogs nip you in the butt okay it's a nip it in the bud the idea is well you know cut it off before it but if you've got weeds you know that'd you've got those weeds all day long and as long as their roots there they'll be back sooner than you expected no if you're just nipping nipping something in the butt it's already it's already too late there's an old expression that says no filter at the faucet will work if there's a dead horse in the you just think about that one let no root of bitterness spring up that many be defiled the word literally", "means to be contaminated it's all through scripture it's hard you can choose many examples but one that comes to mind is of course david and his relationship with his son absalom if you remember what happens uh david's david has multiple wives and so there's a lot of relationships there and one of david's sons is attracted to his stepsister tamar and through subtrafuge and deception he pretends he's sick and tamar comes to bring him some soup basically and he he rapes his stepsister and defiles her and when word by the way tamar's brother full brother is absalom word comes to david he's upset about it doesn't do anything about it think of eli with his sons who deals with their problem but doesn't really take him out of the ministry he's offended but that's about it and something grows inside of absalom on behalf of his sister this injustice makes him a bitter man it'll lead to absalom hating his father leading a revolution in israel to take the kingdom from his father david will flee as far as absalom is concerned he wants his dad dead and absalom will eventually lose his tragic how bitterness can determine the direction of your life sometimes people display really what's going on in their heart maybe they're hurt or angry about things with politics or our nation or who knows what and they do it on social media have you you know that jesus said this out of the abundance of the heart the fingers type okay well the mouth speaks in other words what comes out of our mouth it's kind of like the dipstick to you can see what's inside a person's heart by how they talk what they talk about maybe sometimes we should rename facebook face off do you remember the character from peanuts named pigpen looks like this can we put pigpen a pig pigpen he always seems to be kind of in a good mood he brings his own atmosphere with him wherever he goes there's an old saying never wrestle with the pig you'll both get dirty and the pig likes it a woman went up to deal moody once and she said i she was a very outspoken woman known in this country very gossipy woman she said mr booty i i believe i have found my talent and he said oh really he said what's that she said it's speaking my mind he said well madam that is one talent god would not mind if you kept can you jot it down but do more than that ephesians 4 29 if you struggle with saying things you", "online or in person here's our verse for us ephesians 4 and verse 29 let no literally in the greek it's let no unwholesome word proceed from your mouth but only such a word is is good for what building somebody up for edification according to the need of the moment that it may give grace to those who here can you imagine if anybody and everybody had a filter they could not they would not put anything but that would edify on social media i expect it from the world but i don't think it's right for the we can disagree with each other all day long about vaccines and masks i don't care i really don't care that we have differences of opinion about those i'm not here to get you to believe what i believe about those things but you know what while some of those issues may be unclear ephesians 4 29 is black and white clear we're never to speak a word except a builds up and edifies that's really and i just want to encourage us by the way i've learned this the hard way so i can say it unfortunately the best way to save face keep the lower half of it shut many i have never had to apologize for something i did not say put this down grace is god's he says in our text that this issue of is a problem in verse 15 see to it that no one comes short of the grace of god and the no root of bitterness springs up causes trouble and many are defiled there's grace all through the bible there's grace in our lives as well the men that david started out with who will become his mighty men of valor incredible at war but first samuel 22 and verse 2 describes them first samuel 22 2 and everyone who was and everyone who was in debt and was bitter in soul gathered to david he became commander over them god uses grace how it starts out with in the midst of their damage that's what jesus did for me and you that's what jesus did with matthew the or zacchaeus or the woman caught in mary who was possessed or legion and on and on and on he accepted us right where we were with all of the effects of sin other people's sin and our own and that's what people need who walk in or walk into your life will you jot down romans 15 and verse 7. wherefore accept one another just as also has accepted us to the glory of god grace transforms a person's hearts", "it's more than theology to understand why god sent his son it's more than accepting salvation the moment that we are forgiven it's all of that and more it should transform us james and john you remember this story from the gospels they knew the samaritans were perverse in their theology they knew that they were reprobate and half-breeds and they didn't like they didn't want anything to do with the samaritans i'm sure they weren't thrilled when jesus came through the town was at psychar at all get the bread get in let's get on with the we don't want to but they saw jesus have mercy on a woman a samaritan woman and the men of the but at one point when jesus is on his way to jerusalem he's coming through samaria with his disciples and the samaritans can tell their jews and basically they turn on the no vacancy sign at every motel hotel along the way not because there wasn't room but because there's no room for you here do you remember james and john's reaction lord it's pretty offensive do do you want us go ahead and call down fire like elijah did it's biblical and consume them and i'm sure james and john were thinking can we get an amen here can we get a do you remember what jesus said you do not know what spirit you're of i didn't come to destroy people i came to save them in other words you're polar opposites of where my spirit is they're offensive yes they don't know me but i'm going to die for every single one of them it's interesting that john would be one of the ones in acts 8 after philip does his ministry and people are that must come with peter to pray for the holy spirit to fall on the samaritans he's now of a spirit john who wanted to burn him out now wants to see the spirit of almighty god come upon them and john becomes of all the apostles what we call the apostle of love he talks more about it than any other apostle maybe people have hurt you and you're angry and you're hurt god's saying i want you to show them grace they're in the book of exodus studying on wednesday night but back in chapter 15 children of israel have come out into the wilderness by the way this is just the beginning of their they've just come through the red sea how do i know because they've just had the song of moses celebrating what god did to the egyptians the very next thing that happens is they", "out in the desert and there's no water and god lets them go a little while and they start to get grumpy and complaining and they're upset did you bring us out here to diet first you know something if i were god's one yes no i wouldn't have done but uh that's not wasn't the case and worse they're thirsty there's no water and god brings them to water that they can't it's bitter it's salty it's it's it was bad enough when there was no water but that water and then go what and so now they're ticked off not only a god they're ticked off in moses and moses is i can pick you know they have people coming hey wait just a bit he cries out to the lord which is always the 9-1-1 in any emergency for a stop and talk to god and the bible says when he cries out to the lord god showed him a tree and now it's right at that point i'm kind of thinking and because god doesn't say anything other put the tree in the water so i'm sure the people are thinking what are you doing get a shovel dig a well tell us you've got camels coming tell us there's an answer nope we're taking this tree and we're putting it into the salty would somebody please arrest moses because he has lost his marbles but when he obeys the lord the water is healed the water becomes the bitter becomes sweet and the people are satisfied by the way god never takes his children to task for grumbling he does that later these are brand new baby christians you know when you when your baby comes home from scott's logan he's three weeks old when the baby cries in the middle of the night because they're thirsty or hungry you don't get upset well maybe you do you shouldn't it's like that's what now when they're 17 a whole different chapter of the bible but the picture could it be any clearer how does something bitter ever become redeemed to be something god can use well that's genesis 50. that's joseph saying to his brothers you hated me you wanted me dead you wanted the money that's the only reason you didn't kill me what you did you did it for evil but god i didn't know it then but i know now he was doing it for good to bring about this present salvation and redemption of egypt and my whole family i'm not angry at you god has redeemed my bitterness you have to add the tree", "you have to add the cross it's the only what has christ done for you that's matthew 18 that's the basis of our ability to forgive anybody who ever does anything and everything to us it's that it never measures up to what god has already forgiven us amen peter said we're to grow in grace you sometimes people refer to christians that we are trophies of grace that's true do you know that the bible says god's eternal purpose in saving us was to show in the ages to come you know some of you what are we going to do a billion years from now i don't know but i do know one our salvation that the fact that he redeemed us is to show his grace now there's another side of that it's like wait a minute god's gonna prove how gracious he is by saving me it's not exactly the most commendable thing to say about me see paul put it this way god revealed christ to his disciples to the women the resurrected to over 500 one time and then to me as to one untimely born in other words i don't deserve to be in god's family why because i persecuted the church they didn't i was on the wrong side of this thing but because of my ignorance god showed mercy to me he is gracious he's reached down even as far as me i'm the chief of sinners if he can forgive me i don't care what you've done he can forgive you that's what paul is saying i am a trophy of the grace of god and by the way so are you if you're saved and when we get hold of that we realize oh god thank you that you are proving yourself gracious by saving even someone like me i'm okay with being a trophy of grace but guess what god doesn't want you to settle for being a trophy of grace or a recipient of grace he wants you to be a channel of grace but sometimes we can take it and not dish it out it's a whole lot easier to take it than to dish it out now you can pursue peace with somebody you're at odds with or you've offended or they've offended you there is no you will ever be able to restore that or that that bitter person will ever change but if you will be obedient to you'll know that he'll be able to commend you for your faithfulness and god can change your heart even if he theirs but he can't if you won't pursue", "if you here's what jesus said if you come to church or if you come to worship the lord you know this passage and there as you're coming to church well wait a minute there's that guy there's that sister that really annoyed me i got ticked off at i got upset with i shouldn't have said or they shouldn't whenever you are aware of somebody you're at odds with jesus says you know what put worship on hold isn't worship the most important thing we'll do for all eternity he says but you know what i want you to show you love me by the way you love so i want you to see the connection i don't want you just to go on in a relationship with me and ignore the problem you have with them leave your gift at the altar go be made right now you can't control but you can purpose to pursue it and say lord i want to do all that is in my ephesians 4 32 is the way that this happens be kind to one another forgiving each other just as god in christ has also forgiven you by the way people many times say i can't forgive or i try to forgive i think the greek is very helpful what does it mean to forgive it's the word in greek and it simply means listen to this let it go you might want to write those words down you might need them today tomorrow oh yeah the rest of your let it go christ's forgiving us is the power is the key for us to be able to let it go doesn't mean your pride is going to help you well they started it what they did was worse you know we we said that when we were little kids didn't we they pinched me they hit me did we just get more sophisticated i have forgiven them in my mind i love them like a christian just don't want to ever see their faith on earth yeah we we really haven't let it go now put this down let it be pursue for christ's sake there's two things we're to pursue the first was peace with jesus said if you don't forgive your brother from your heart neither will your heavenly father forgive you it doesn't mean it's going to send you to you're still this child but you will not enjoy fellowship with god i mean peter says husbands be careful how you treat your wives give her honor as a fellow heir of life prayers will be the word is hindered but", "it literally means to chop up a road you're not going nowhere here don't think you can just go on with me and treat her that way it doesn't work that it is going to affect your relationship with me whether you know it or not but we're also to pursue according to in verse 14 sanctification now this is a word that we don't use outside of the bible i don't think i've ever heard anybody's psyche to find me a hamburger i'll just come back later for it it's like when i was in high school there was a the first one i heard down at calvary in the tent days there was a love song um and it was a brand new christian um and a guy named big bill sprouse was the main leader and uh some of you know their song um from psalm 5 give ear to my words o lord and it was tom stipe that said god gave david the words and gave bi big bill sprouse this but they they they were called sanctified that was their name i remember they came i was still i'm 16. i'm in high school el dorado and they came we got them to come and do a concert at lunch and share the gospel but they had changed their name we just changed our name they had only come out a few weeks beforehand and it's like our name now is the road home and so i went up to bill sprouse i said why would you change your name he said nobody had a clue what signified means so we just decided the road home uh and i'm not sure things have gotten much better in these 50 years or 40 years whatever it was since those days uh a lot of sanctified justice what does that mean well it's built in the greek on the word sanctification speaks of being set apart for the lord holy to god that's what it and here we are being told to pursue holiness or to pursue being set apart for the lord so pursue purity is the word i want you to fill in and jot down matthew 5 and verse 8 remember in the sermon about jesus said blessed are the pure in heart for they shall see god and that ties in with what is said here because he says without sanctification without purity without holiness no one will see the lord now listen i am a patriot but my passport will never get me into the kingdom of god and on a day like today i like to thank the lord for", "allowing us to be living in this nation i i do not hate my nation i i'm sad for those who god's answer it is not but i have tried a good life and i try to but i know my righteousness is as filthy in terms of qualifying me for heaven the bible's really clear about that john 3 nicodemus was a moral man but jesus said accept your righteousness exceed that of the scribes and the pharisees which he was one of you won't enter the kingdom of heaven nicodemus it's not enough to be a good guy to believe the right things you need born again you need to be born from above there needs to be a righteousness from god on the basis of faith now so when we talk about sanctification people get confused i am trying to be pursuing sanctification so i will see the lord it sounds like work salvation that's not what it's why because when you came to christ by faith you were justified you were made righteous declared righteous on the basis of faith before you did anything you don't lose that because you failed christ is our justification and our sanctification jot it down first corinthians 1 30 by god's doing you believers are in christ who became to us wisdom from god and righteousness and here it is same word hagasmos sanctification and redemption in other words we already are holy so we're not talking here about trying to get to heaven the idea here it seems to be more like that our holy lives in other words he made us holy positionally we are sinless before god because of christ but on a practical level we're still growing in christ so sanctification is an ongoing work in this life as he conforms us into the image of his son the idea here seems to be this that our holy lives follow me on this are the only way anyone else will ever really see that god is real without which no one will see the lord down in san diego back in i think it was 1990 a church there had a statue of jesus with his arms held out and some vandals in the night broke the the hands off of the statue and they were going to repair it they had the donation that somebody wanted to give to repair it and they said no instead they actually put a plaque still there to this day he has no hands but ours and the idea is people in this world ever see the well they'll see the invisible god by the lives that he's", "changed by your pursuing living honoring you and i get the privilege of a life change jesus put it this way let your light so shine before men that they see your good works and do what they focus on the father they glorify your father who is in heaven but put this down seek more of the lord himself seek more of the lord himself we used to sing a song i come to thee on bended knee with just one plea give me more of thee give me more of the jesus take all of me paul said i pursue the upward call of god in christ jesus in order that i may gain christ not gain rewards it's about gaining christ i want i want more of him shut down psalm 42 in verse one you know this one as the deer pants for the water so my soul pants for thee oh god and ii corinthians 7 you know ii corinthians 7 1 i want to share it with you but the background of it is chapter 6. there were no chapter and it's talking about being unequally yoked don't be unequally yoked with and it talks about living a holy life and it says he quotes the old testament where god said to his people come out from their midst the other nations come out from their midst and be separate i'll be a father to you and you'll be sons and daughters to me i want a relationship with you so live unto me live holy unto me and then he says this in second corinthians 7 1 therefore having these promises of god to us beloved let us cleanse from all defilement of flesh and spirit holiness in the fear of god in other an obligation to live a certain way but we want a relationship with the lord that's what's motivating us to change our lives i i like to use the example that when i first met my wife she wasn't my wife and but i liked her and i if i remember right she didn't like me doing sorry that i don't know that's kind of a manly thing to do you know i don't know where anybody decides that's masculine i think anybody can do it but anyway and she just happened to mention it to me one day oh don't do that i think that was the last time i did it's been 39 years i i literally said i don't want to do why because i i care what she thinks of me see when you love the lord you start wanting to make changes", "because you love the lord and you want to maintain a relationship with him there's lots of ways to fall away from god read the book of jude it's kind of a history of how the children of israel fell away this way and that way and there's lots of ways to sin and your sin is in mind i got my own but there's one way to keep from sin and jude says it this way keep yourself in the love of god what does that mean keep yourself aware of how much he loves you because if you love him jesus said if you love me you will keep my commandments you see if you love me you you'll obey why because you'll want to is the idea and so here in our text it's seeking a relationship with the lord put this down number two surrender to the lord not your lusts he says there in verse 16 see to it that there be no immoral or godless person like esau we jot down first corinthians 6 and verse 13. food is for the stomach i don't like reading that this time of day people going let's just go to lunch now food is for the stomach i made it for the stomach is for food but god will do away with both of them yet is not for immorality but for the lord and the lord is for the body sometimes people will say i really am trying to know god's will for my life well start with where he's revealed in the bible saying this is my will there are several times one of those is in first thessalonians 4 and verse 3 this is the will of god it's right there in black and white your sanctification being set apart for the lord being holy that is that you abstain from sexual immorality what is sexual immorality the word immorality is the word pornia it's where we get our word pornography but it involves all the sexual sin that are listed in leviticus 18 and it's basically sexual sin outside sex outside of the relationship of marriage in which it is god's gift now sexual sin is not the only sin or the biggest sin in the world but it will the holy spirit in your life it'll diminish your spiritual strength just think samson remember the he-man with the she weakness think of david who could slay the giant goliath the only thing is lust was the giant that slew david in his own it's interesting that when jesus is being gracious to the woman at the well", "he's revealing to her that he's the messiah and that there's a better water that he has available to her by the way she has not come to faith yet she is not repentant of any sins but spiritual water it's amazingly gracious you guys the other day you know with some of the sin in your life we can talk about some of the benny's benefits here of being a critic no they're available i want you to know what i want to do for you it's amazing and at one point you know he says to her you know go call your husband and come and she says uh about that i'm not married he goes oh yeah yeah i know that because you've had five husbands and guy you're living with now he's actually no you're not married and she said i i perceive you're a it's like let's not talk about that let's talk about you she's a very other person all of a sudden very can i say to you it's pretty clear from the text he's not saying that to shame he's not saying i know the sin you're in what he's saying is i love you and there's some things in your life that you know are not pleasing to god you see none of us want to go to a doctor who's not willing to deal with the cause of our pain it's like well i'm going to put you on a a doctor i think my heart's going to stop vitamin d you need somebody who's going to do they need to deal with the problem and the lord will put his finger lovingly on the sin he always says he won't ignore it because he loves us and of course she comes to faith she comes running back she sensed he wasn't judging her i don't know i was talking about how many people are living together nowadays even in the church and i i didn't know but a couple told me just recently that they had been living together i guess something from that point in the passage where scripture is clear they looked at each other and they said we need to get married praise god they're married they're in love with the lord following the lord they're excited about coming to church not because they got that part of their life right but because they came to christ he gave them an appetite for him an appetite for obedience we need to tell the truth we're not trying to make it easy on people to come together while we won't mention the fact that you know", "no that's not love have mentioned before that i used to go fishing up in yosemite and i'm honest enough to admit to you i i was never very successful at catching a fish there there's always people that come up after the service let me tell you it's like i'm gonna sleep in but anyway uh i don't even sleep in anymore but back then i did and uh but i would get up and go fishing you know nine or ten in the morning i don't like fish enough to catch them i guess but anyway but it would always it was weird because the rivers you can see right through them to the bottom and you can see the they're beautiful they're there they're in my bait and i would find out what bait are you using okay you know i'd ask the people that are catching them and i would use the same thing didn't work for so what am i doing wrong well it might have something to do with what hour you're going down there because you see those fish they they the early fish catches the whatever i mean the fact is they ate long time ago it's not even time for lunch for them they're just sound asleep i literally would take the i would because you can see them i would hold it right over their little fish nose i don't know if they smell but i figured they must see and i would put the little worm or whatever power right over them and i would kind of i'm not trying to hook them on the side i mean i couldn't get him to move not hungry not interested keep yourself in the love of god turn your eyes upon jesus look full in his the things of this world that are so guess what the only way to overcome the power of temptation is to fall in love with jesus christ to your first love you'll have a passion for him it'll be easy to say no you want to have a healthy marriage this is you want to avoid the immoral woman have sexual relationship in your marriage let your wife be intoxicated with her the bible says do you see the same principle being well put this down stop leaving god out it interesting it says don't let there be an immoral but or a godless person and it gives a name esau who sold his birthright for a single meal remember he was more lunch than he was the inheritance the and so he sold it to his brother jacob", "uh you know just for a single you know i don't know chunky beef soup for a bowl of beans literally he says for you know that even afterwards later when esau wanted to inherit the blessing he comes to his dad and he says wait you gave my brother the blessing he's a liar he tricked you and i now just you have a back-up blessing for me certainly got another blessing in your and he's like yeah no you lost it he was rejected and he found no place for repentance though he sought it with tears this word um godless don't make more of it than what it says godless just means leaving god out that's all it means the word in the original language speaks of a doorway a threshold that you cross over and the ideas of crossing over into the world and finding your fulfillment there eternal things as worthless maybe it expresses itself in more simple ways for you you just don't have a you don't really desire to maybe be in church but you come or maybe you don't read any you don't have any hunger for the word of god if you're honest maybe you used to maybe you've never had it you don't really have a desire to pray and even if you do you don't you don't pray you don't ask for permission you don't give god thanks oh you could you will at thanksgiving if you're forced to but it's not coming out of your own heart you leave god out anybody can do that joshua made a covenant with the gibeonites bible says he took some of their provisions they said they were from a distant land they were actually around the corner and so he didn't ask the lord he didn't ask god for permission at all and he enters into this covenant that was out of the will of god you just stop you start leaning on your and you don't ask god for direction now it's true esau wept when he saw that he had lost his birthright don't get the idea here is that that god wouldn't allow him to repent it sounds like he's repenting he's crying no listen if you've ever known somebody who is in prison or if you've ever done prison ministry you know that quite criminals are very upset about what mostly because they got caught don't like the consequences of what i've done that's not repentance simply crying when you've got a ticket or you're going to jail for drunk driving or whatever it is that's not repentance that's regret judas had great remorse he returned the", "money and he went out and he hung worldly sorrow leads to death godly sorrow leads to repentance it's important to understand that you know maybe you're here and and you know your bible but my question is do you know christ he says don't let anyone come short of the grace of god you come to church but have you come to christ is my listen according to the bible romans 3 23 you know this we have all every one of us fallen short of the glory of god there's no need for anyone to fall short of the grace of maybe maybe you've had a very hard life maybe you identify yourself as that and you wish you weren't you wish there was a cure there is it's the grace of god maybe there's someone here and you haven't even lately wanted to live maybe you've thought about taking like maybe you've actually tried but you're still alive don't fall short of the grace of god maybe say i've done things bob that people they would never i can't forgive myself i don't care if you can forgive forgiving yourself doesn't open up heaven to you you need to allow god to forgive you and guess what that's available whether you think he should or not he probably shouldn't forgive any of us but grace of god come to him and say lord i need healing soul and let the finished work of christ out into your life he'll take what was bitter and he will make it sweet when you add the tree let's pray i pray for the people here who are struggling in a relationship with but i also pray for anyone here who's struggling really in a relationship with even if they don't know it that they're running from you they're afraid lord maybe they've prayed a prayer and nothing happened and you know that they need to be accepted right where they are with the fears the frustrations the questions the confusion thank you lord that there's no qualification test to become your child other than admitting and we need help would you pour out your afresh on us would you pour it out through us to people who don't deserve it any more than we do would you help us to let it go and be healed as best we can and be a reflection of what you've done for us in jesus name i pray amen let's all stand and sing together your love is greater your love is your love awakens awakens may the lord i mean this very this is not like some benediction i got recorded", "okay may the lord's grace the grace that you know was displayed on may it be upon you today may it rest on first for your own failings maybe the committed last night you know i tell you something i'm glad you're here jesus does not care whose bed you slept in last night if you want his forgiveness he's ready to give it to you he's not looking at all the things you've done wrong because guess what he's not surprised and he already paid for all of them amen all of them what he wants is you he you may his grace rest upon you today and may it be proven by the way you offer it to somebody else listen to me the next time somebody it'll be soon not joking it will instead of getting upset which you will be tempted to do say to yourself right now this is my chance to be christ-like this is my chance to give somebody something they don't deserve may you be a channel of the grace of god for the people in your family may you take initiative to pursue and trusting god with the results but may rest upon you god bless you worthy of celebrating not the fact that they had to die but the fact that they gave their lives amen you know jesus said blessed are those and for they shall be comforted right the word there for blessed it means happy are those who mourn basically in the greek happy are those who mourn for they shall be comforted because it brings us closer to god's heart not only those who are mourning things in our own lives but we can mourn for those who are mourning the loss of others and so we can come to a weekend like and uh tomorrow we're going to honor so many that have fallen and we can mourn for them and that can bring us closer to god's heart because is what does god say what does jesus say also he says that a new commandment i'm giving to you that you love one another right love one another and he says no greater love is this then a man would lay down for his friend and so we can mourn with those who mourn but then we can come closer to god's heart on the matter because god gave his only son to lay down his not just for like his friend but for those who hated him also right he died for the sins of the world and so he's redeemed us and that is something we're celebrating here this morning", "so tomorrow we're going to remember those we've lost today we're going to remember what we've gained through christ amen and so uh we haven't done this in a while but why don't you turn to somebody give him a fist bump because you know we're still being cautious give him a fist bump and say i love you because he loved me first there were chains around us by your are no longer bound longer bound you call me out of the grave you call me into the light feel the darkness shaking in all the your love is greater your love is your love awakens awakens awakens me your love is greater your love is your love is greater your love is give me vision to see things give me wisdom to see things give me wisdom cause you know just all my days give me visions to see things and i will love you cause you know just what to do the father of kindness you you brought me out of darkness you will be faithful all your promises is you pull me from the ashes you have broken everything all your promises are yes oh you've always been faithful time and time again all your promises they are yesterday all your promises they are yesterday we have confidence in that faithfulness he was faithful before he is faithful still and he'll be faithful again we sing those words all your promises are guessing him and all of god's promises have been fulfilled in christ jesus and so we don't have to wonder if it's true we don't have to say oh i don't is he gonna do what he said he's gonna do no he's done what he he's gonna do amen so we can now rest in it you know we don't always feel restful in our controls trials tribulations and but we can rest in the fact that he is those trials tribulations and troubles and so i'm excited to sing those words here this morning and you know last i don't like to pit two services against each other but most of them are sitting by now and so i'm just saying uh and so i made a joke i said hello since you're sitting down go ahead and but here's the thing they appreciated it i i could tell and uh but here's the thing uh it's a joke because some of you worship different than others or some of you actually manifest your worship differently than others some of you like to shout some of you like to fall on your face before the", "lord some of you like to raise your kneel sit quietly and contemplate the what he desires is you to worship him in and in truth and what he desires is that you put yourself on the altar that you're a living sacrifice he doesn't only desire a song he doesn't only desire hands lifted he wants those an outpouring of what's happening inside in your heart and some of you might have this morning and you're like yeah i'm ready let's go i'm going to put a soundtrack to what i'm doing all the time and some of you said you know i need to kind of reshift i want to prune away the things that i'm not using to live for his glory you know whether you eat drink or whatever you do you want to do it all for the glory of god but something unique happens when we join together in unity and do that and seek to do that as a group we can encourage one another with psalm 10 and spiritual songs i met a brother just right after service first service and he said hey i'm blessed by your worship and i said honestly i'm blessed by your worship because you're always there and you're always ready to just give god your all and it moves me to give even more and so we don't want you to see yourself as an audience we want you to see yourself as a family and a family can step in the gap when sometimes you're not feeling so good and that's true for you they're at home you're not just a spectator watching something in some kind of entertainment but we want to engage you with the living god but not only with the living god we want to engage you with us because you joined together with us and we love you and i know many of you have reached out and said hey thanks for looking in the camera every once in a while i'll keep doing it until you can show up here in person but we do love you so we're going to transition now into not reluctantly we don't want to do it out of obligation either but we want to do it at a full intention to glorify him just the way same way that we sing the same way we open the word and apply it to our lives we want to use that for his glory and so if you have the app you can go to the app uh the calvary chaplis anaheim app and we facilitate giving there there's also an opportunity for you to", "put up prayer requests and so that we know how to be praying for you as a church body and then if you don't have the app or if you're watching it online there's a link that'll pop up on the bottom of your screen and that's where we facilitate it for you and so we want to offer it to the lord and then we're going to sing another song of just complete adoration to the and just glorifying him for who he is we've seen a lot about what he's done and there's plenty of merit to sing but sometimes it's just nice to see who he is he is holy he has set up art he is of our praise and so we're going to do that and we're going to let it show in every aspect of our life and so let's pray committed to the lord and then can sing together and then open his word together lord we're thankful to be in this place worshiping you in spirit and truth not just in a location not just in one facet of life but we want to give all of ourselves and sing holy is the worthy is the lamb and so let every aspect of our life be that that is just uh giving you praise and honor so whether it's through finances through through growing in our knowledge of you through your word through sharing you with others around us we want to do it with full intention to say that you are and lifted up you are set apart and you are worthy of it so we love you we pray these in jesus name amen for the tears you wept for those you long to gather for your passion for your bride that thank you that was awesome how you doing barely see you guys actually but good to see you guys and uh

about joining us we are in the book of hebrews i would like you to well first of all before you stand up and do all that stuff let me just ask a question do you have your bible would you would you be willing just to show me wow all right well then we got to sing by song that we like to sing everybody stan everybody stand up ready oh the b-i-b-l-e yes that's the book for me i stand alone on the word of god the b-i-b-l-e you guys sound great in the bible so if if you didn't get to sing because you're going i have it it's all it's hidden in my heart we'd love you to bring your bible if you can if you don't have one we have a bookstore with every opportunity as well we give you a free bible over here in the prayer room afterwards if you would like one chapter 12 if you will turn there and beginning in verse 14. i was blown away i thought many of you would yeah i leave my bible at home now because i didn't know thank you guys that's awesome i don't", "know how many churches still they bring their bibles but this one does pursue peace this is verse 14 with all and the sanctification without which no see the lord see to it that no one comes short of the grace of god that no root of bitterness springing up causes trouble and by it many be defiled that there be no immoral or godless like esau who sold his birthright for a for you know that even afterwards when he desired to inherit the blessing he for he found no place for repentance though he sought it with tears father i'm just excited to be here with your people to start out a new day a new week and to do it in your presence thanks for the worship that prepares our hearts softens our heart gets our focus where it needs to now lord we ask that you would take your word and you would reveal to us those truths that you want to apply today this week in our life right now and i am so excited about what your spirit's going to teach us lord for your glory in jesus name i pray amen you can be seated well we've been studying the book of hebrews and of course we in context are in the what's considered the practical part of the book meaning uh that we have studied the theology we've been called to now run the race with endurance remember those early jewish christians were tempted to go back to the temple ritual i know you some of you might be new here and so in context the idea is hey look you're not the first one who ever ran this race but you're to be in the race all the way to the end and then of course our great example is jesus and we've talked a little bit about god disciplining us and the ideas the believers there had started to fall away started to drift away and so he's calling them back into this race this marathon of faith and then he very practically to them about some needs in their life if they're gonna run the race because the word pursue in the greek it's the word dioco and it literally means run so he's still talking about metaphor of running and he's talking what the goal of running should be now we use the term that's why i use the phrase in pursuit as a police officer if i got on the radio in pursuit it meant very clearly i was chasing somebody right i'm trying to catch them i'm hoping they'll stop for my", "siren and or you know i don't want them to crash but i want them to stop doing whatever they're doing they're bad and i give them a ticket or maybe worse take them to jail and so one of the things they teach police officers in the police academy is how to do pursuit driving because while you know many of us maybe when we were younger drove too fast or some of us still do doing that in a safe manner is not easy because one of the things that happens when a police officer goes in pursuit the lights and the siren get their adrenaline running right because they they now have the authority to go through red lights and break the law actually to try to get breaking the law yeah i know it's kind anyway but that's their job and uh the one of the known things that happens to anybody in a code three situation is something called tunnel vision tunnel vision is where you actually get really laser focused on what you're pursuing the car the motorcycle the and and your peripheral vision goes down it's a known psychological effect as your adrenaline flows but there is in terms of what we're studying something to understand that here of pursuing these things there's two things that he's telling us where to focus on and pursue there's not 10 just two but they are to be so important to us that we are going after them like a cop would a bad guy the first pursuit i got into uh when i was a police officer i was just 21 years old late at night i was working graveyard shift in la habra and uh a police officer that had been on the earlier shift we have an overlapping shift there back in those days we worked four tens and he was on swing shift i was on graveyard it was a little after midnight and he called in uh 245 on a police officer which which actually means somebody has tried to shoot him or kill him or hurt him and that was he was yelling into his his microphone 245 on an officer 245 on officers i was dispatched to go back him up and uh so i i raced up their code three i was sent up their co3 and as i got to the scene the officer who was on the radio is pointing at a vehicle that was just zooming by him like that's him and and i remember this this this you know i was alone up there in the north end of alahabra if you know anything", "orange county you know la habra is the northwesternmost city of the county which probably doesn't matter to you but the fact is when you're a police officer and you go outside of your city limits your your radio doesn't work too well it's not designed to work much beyond the limits of your city so there's other channels at least at that time you could use orange north was one of those for north orange county the it's made for orange county so i get out of the city chasing this guy into territory i've never been in in my life because now we're in la county well guess what orange north green channel doesn't work that's the city orange north doesn't work because that's and now there's one other channel that's red channel that's like where every police officer in the entire county will be listening in so you know you want to just not like look like a fool so you know you don't want to do that so i'm all alone chasing this guy after midnight there's nobody else with us and and i go on to red channel and as i push red channel i hear a siren and it's it's a siren of a garden grove police officer who's just started a pursuit down in garden grove and so suddenly it's like i can't even broadcast and i'm trying to put out my location i'm trying i put in the license plate of the vehicle and i'm chasing this guy and i'm saying to myself you tried to hurt one of our police officers you're going down you know i felt very much like the royal canadian mountie at that point you know we always get our man you know i don't know what it's gonna take to get you but i'm gonna i'm not giving up and i remember we had a sheriff's deputy from la so get involved in the pursuit we couldn't talk to each other we're on different channels and we were going so fast through all kinds of red lights we lost him he was gone it was just me and this guy and uh we we about 20 minutes up into the hills where you know no one lives well i guess somebody lives there because he was heading home i didn't know it but we i remember i stayed on his tail he wound up going on this really steep driveway up to this house i got out and i thought that's it he's not going anywhere out of here this is going to be a shootout", "i jump out of my car and i say to the guy who's getting out of his car freeze he did not freeze i thought that would work freeze he didn't freeze he ran instead toward the house i thought oh no no no in pursuit royal canadian magic i'm running after this guy with my gun he runs into the house shuts the door i didn't even think to try the knob i was already in the air i was that close to him my foot hit the door the door splintered off the hinges literally it fell off the engine and he's standing on the inside he didn't know what was happening and i put my gun in his stomach and i said you're going to jail he said no i'm not i said yes you are we had a little difference of opinion about and then he said this was kind of just the adrenaline he goes i don't have a gun and i go oh okay i put my gun away like let's do this there oh fashion way and so we i don't know it's just what i did we start fighting you know and i wind up on the ground he's trying to get away and there's some people in there i don't know who they are and they're saying do you need help do you need help i said i'm thinking i hope they're talking to me but they're probably talking to him this is not good you know and i left my car outside with the siren the lights going on i mean it's midnight you know there weren't too many houses but there were a few and i'm sure they're awake so nobody knew where i was so i thought finally this guy and i are fighting back and forth and i remembered oh yeah chokeholds are still legal because it's in the past anyway so i was able to uh put him to sleep briefly get the handcuffs on him and right as i did and he was in custody it turned out that the people that were saying do you need help deputy i'm thinking i'm not a deputy i was a police officer but they were in la uh turned out to be the guy's parents and they actually were asking me if i needed help thankfully i didn't know what to do they just you know i don't know through with our son anyway uh i knew what to do with their son anyway i got them up and i'm walking them out to my car which is still lights and siren and about that", "time the entire world showed up i mean we're talking helicopters and cops from every department you know and i just felt so good taking i violated all kinds of rules i got a lot of trouble i wasn't supposed to go into the house and i shouldn't let the pursuit go but anyway the idea is this going in pursuit means nothing else is going to distract me from this i'm going to achieve my goal this is the word that paul the apostle used in 3. he said whatever things were gaining me i've counted those loss in fact i count everything to be lost in view of the surpassing value of christ for whom i've suffered the loss of all things and count them but rubbish that i may gain christ and this one thing i do i press on that's the same greek word i run after it for the upward call of god i have one thing in mind i want to know him and i want to honor him with my life so two things here that are mentioned by the writer to the hebrews that are important enough for you and i to get this idea that we should be put it down pursue peace with people put in the word peace and jot down psalm 34 and verse 14. sub 34 14 depart from evil do good seek peace and here it is per se it put this down not always possible is no excuse not to pursue it now if you know your bibles you know why i'm saying this but put in the word excuse and jot down romans 12 and verse 18. if possible paul writes so far as it depends on you be at peace with all men in so far some translations have it insofar as it is possible with you be at peace with all men and the fact is just because you know there are some that it might not be possible with that's not your excuse then to never actually pursue it can i suggest to you that the devil is an expert at using god's word to tempt us to avoid obeying god's will you say what do you mean remember how the devil talks to eve he doesn't mind quoting the bible hath god not said to jesus himself the throw yourself down from the pinnacle of the temple for god hath said and he he'll give his angels charged concerning you unless you dash your foot against he'll use the word of god if he can to tempt you to disobey the will of god", "there's lots of ways people do this well you know the bible says happy are the people whose god is the lord and i'm not it's the will of god that i'd be happy and so since he came to give me an abundant life that's john 10 10 and i don't feel very abundant in this marriage i think god's will is for me to get a divorce you see you could take god's words and principles and you satan can tempt you to disobey the will of god and he can even use the word of god so why do i tell you that because it's possible for some of us who are at odds with suddenly say well i just know it's not possible with that person i just know they're impossible and there are some people that are harder to get along with than others there's no question about that all of us at some point are going to know at least one person who could take the role of grumpy and you know snow white and the seven dwarfs if he ever retires they're a shoo-in they're just kind of that way like that lady the guy said you know have a nice day she said i have maybe you know something like that it seems like they're always that way but god isn't tasking you or me with the responsibility of making he is tasking you and me with going after it though and that's what he's going to ask us someday what did you do you see it's kind of like sharing the gospel we think well that person's not open you know the bible never says only share with people that are open now it does say don't give what is holy to dogs i know that verse two the fact is a lot of times we don't have a clue where people are we think well they don't go to church they're not really into jesus why would i share jesus with him ah hello they need to know him how will they know unless they're said unless they share the bible's really the parable of the sower the seed goes everywhere even on soil that will never germinate our job is not to be seed analyzers it's to be seed casters right we're to share the gospel with everybody results are up to the lord same thing when jesus said there in matthew if your brother says go reprove him in private in order to win him back so many sins against you doesn't say well if you're in the mood or if you think", "they'll receive it no we're not giving any of those graces to decide we are simply called to obey and the same thing is true here insofar as it is possible with you pursue peace the question is have you done that picture this way i'm a cop i'm working somebody comes flying over the hill and it's 120 miles an hour and i what and i go ah they're way too i could never catch them where that would go i'll wait for somebody's going no no no that's my job i don't get to how what the chances of me catching somebody are in the same way you and i don't have a right to disobey this command put this down neither are we given a pass sometimes i think christians we think well it's okay that i'm at odds with my and my pagan neighbor well look at the text with me verse 14 pursue peace with it doesn't say all christians you say what if it's a woman it says all actually there's no word man in the original it's just all and i've checked the greek i know what all means all means all that's all that it's everyone be at peace with all people insofar as it is possible with you you know in my own life and repeatedly with other people i've first of all people tend to just allow offended people to go it's just easier to avoid them and as i talk about offended people people you're not at peace with i know some of you have pictures of people coming up on your rolodex right it's that guy that girl and you don't even maybe care or you don't want you don't eat i'll skip right to the next part of the but it's here and it's important enough because jesus said if you have ought against a brother what does that mean you got a problem with somebody or somebody has a problem with you when it comes time to worship and leave your gift at the altar go first be reconciled with your brother or sister that person then come back and offer it that's how important it is what could be more important than worshipping the living god well nothing but one of the ways we worship him is by humbling ourselves and recognizing that people are more to him many times than they are to us it doesn't mean it's going to work it's going to mean you're free to worship god because you've honored his word but we don't get a pass for so a lot of attempts to reconcile with", "people never work because they never but then those where you attempt many times are short-circuited and i'm going to tell you what i've discovered and maybe you have two most attempts to reconcile with somebody that you're at odds work with fail because we come to the table to forgive but not to be forgiven so what do you mean you think it's like i recognize you really messed and i'm now ready to say you're forgiven god bless you say no more i'll let it go but where we struggle with is being ready to actually recognize we've done anything wrong at all that we come really wanting to be because we can see that we've offended somebody put this down bitterness can be a bad reaction to grace you think how could there be any bad reactions to grace well look at the text here it says pursue peace and then it says verse 15. see to it no one comes short of the grace of god i don't know how many are allergic to stuff a lot of you probably i'm allergic to penicillin into sulfur how do i know that well i've had them both and i discovered the hard way i was at a doctor's for something this last week and they asked you those why are you allergic to anything yes penicillin and sulfur how long ago was you had a reaction not long enough i have no intention of finding out if i'm over that just check that out give me something else you know a bad reaction to a medicine yep antibiotic yep do people have a bad reaction to grace sometimes and become bitter they do that's not only this but sometimes it's this remember the laborers that went out to work in the field they were hired at you know in the early and the landowner said i'll give you a day's wage which was the fair that was denarius one day's wage but then he needed more guys so he went out later in the morning and then at noon and then late in the day he's actually hiring people an hour before quitting time he didn't tell him how much he'd pay him he just said you know don't worry i'll you remember what happens in the story at the end of the day they line up and he's paying the people that have only been there an hour and how much does he give the people that have been there one hour working a full day's wage what do you think the people are thinking who have been there", "i was doing this for one day ah if you give them an hour times eight ten i can just do the math this is great i can retire for a week but what did he give them when it came their time to get paid wage they were offended we born the heat of the day this isn't fair he says wait wait wait wait wait you're saying i'm doing check your contract what did i agree with you one day's wage of that i'm not doing anything unjust you are upset that i am generous and the problem is in you not in me now that parable has a lot of other implications but sometimes when people receive grace and you don't think they should you can become embittered the story of the prodigal son's older same thing you killed the fatted calf i never got a fat calf party i've been here my whole life this guy just wasted you just like well you love him more than so when god is gracious to people sometimes they're getting away with stuff that you're living for the lord you're honoring the lord this person is out blowing it they just seem to get blessed by god it's like what's with that i do something wrong i immediately get in trouble this doesn't seem fair you can read psalm 73 asaph had real problems with the wicked he said they die rich fat and i do anything wrong i get in trouble he said until i went into the temple and i realized what's happening after this life and then i realized oh not such a but actually watching people maybe somebody got what you've been waiting they got married they have children they got a house in orange county they they they were blessed in some way have only dreamed of and you don't understand why be careful about becoming bitter as a reaction to somebody else's grace put this down deal with the root of bitterness not the fruit he said let no root of or see to it that no root of bitterness spring up you we have this expression in english you're familiar with it nip it in the now let me just make sure we all know it dogs nip you in the butt this is nipping it in the bud is referring to it blossoms or blooms more but at that point it's already too late if you think about it in terms of what we're dealing with bitterness has a root you can cut the weeds off at the top of your sidewalk all day long they'll be back okay", "so we're talking about rooting out it's going deep this is a deeper work than you can do on the surface there's an old saying no filter at the faucet will do if there is a dead horse in the reservoir that's wow that's brilliant but it's true there's nothing you can do at that point it's too late in the process if there's a dead horse bitterness is something that many times is deep inside of us the bible says a root of bitterness will spring up and defile the word means to contaminate many david who's the example and every king is measured against in the old testament we all know his sins with bathsheba and his census of counting and he he was a man just like us who fails but he didn't do really well sometimes as a father sometimes these are the areas where we struggled the most david had multiple wives and so he had multiple children by multiple wives so many children who were step brothers and stepsisters to each other one of his sons named amnon was attracted to his stepsister her name was tamar tamar had a full brother named absalom also the son of amnon by deception says he's sick and he needs help wants tamar to come bring him some food while he's sick he's not sick at all he's sick but not physically sick and so tamar comes to minister to her stepbrother while she's there he seizes her he rapes her defiles her doesn't want anything to do with her after he wanted her so bad suddenly i didn't want her at all word is brought to david of this injustice of amnon and amnon uh is is spoken to about it david's upset about it but he doesn't do anything more about it because david loved amnon it's very similar to the eli story eli's two sons hoffney and finis are not even believers and they're priests and they're ripping people off and they're sleeping with the women who come to the tenant meeting and eli gets upset about it he even talks to him he shouldn't do it never removes him from the priesthood he valued his children more than he did god and his relationship with him well just never really does anything about absalom just watches absalom starts to hate not just amnon he starts to hate his father and absalom will rebel against david this root of bitterness he'll start talking to the people the men of israel and say you know if i were king and he'll start putting his own father down in overtime the", "bible says he wins the hearts of the nation of israel of israel who love david now they don't love israel david they don't respect and a rebellion happens it'll cost it'll cost absalom his life terrible stuff happens when you let just fester and i wonder is it festering in you is it festering in someone that is close to you sometimes people's bitterness comes out in conversation the bible says out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaks happens all the time on social media i call it social mayhem facebook could be renamed face off and i think many times among christians do you remember the character pig pen from charles schultz peanuts he looks like this remember him pig pen just that character that somebody who brings their own dirty atmosphere wherever they go there's some people like that there's an old saying never wrestle with a pig you will both get dirty and the pig likes it but sometimes they're just people that just it just brings out the nastiness in to be able to speak their mind about something maybe you or somebody else has spoken about true story a woman once went up to dl moody a woman who was just known for her tongue and her gossip and her and she came up to him she said mr moody i have discovered my talent he said oh really he said what's that she said i my talent is speaking my mind he said well madam that is one talent god would not mind if you kept jot down ephesians 4 and verse 29 i wish every christian had this verse written across their screens at all times and across everything that would remind you what to how to act during the day and me too let know in the greek word is let no unwholesome word proceed from your mouth or off your keyboard but only such a word as is good for building others up edification according to the need of the moment that it might give what grace to those who hear that might give grace to those put this down grace is god's pursue peace with all men and sanctification without which no one will see the lord see two that no one comes short of the grace of god that's when the root of bitterness can spring up how do you give grace well you know what grace means is is giving somebody what they don't deserve mercy is not getting what you do deserve judgment i don't get it i get that's the mercy of god i deserve to go to hell", "god not only gives me and you mercy he i like the enact you know the acrostic of grace god's riches at christ's he gives us the very righteousness of it would be enough that we just don't go to hell immediately we get his mercy but we also get what we deserve david uh when he begins his group of 400 men that are following him it's interesting who went out to david jot it down first samuel 22 2. listen to what it says everyone who is in distress everyone who was in debt and everyone who was bitter in soul gathered to him and he became commander over them that's pretty amazing see when people are gracious a person who's bitter of soul will feel jesus does not require that you change you to be accepted by him but when you do accept him he will change you from the inside out we'll talk about that in a minute jot down romans 15 and verse 7 wherefore accept one another just as christ also to the glory of god christ accepts the unacceptable to remember that during the ministry of they traveled through samaria and they went to the woman at the well they're in psychar and i kind of presumed the disciples weren't feeling very comfortable being there at all they went into town got the bread which i don't even know if they wanted to eat it to be honest that's cooties but because normally jews don't deal with samaritans at all but jesus wanted to go there send him into town to buy the bread we know that story but jews normally did not go to samaria but jesus made a habit of walking so at the end of his ministry he's heading to jerusalem and he's committed to getting there and the disciples are with them and as the samaritans in their villages see jews are coming obviously not to come to samaria for vacation but are heading to jerusalem for the feast they start putting up the no vacancy signs at their ends not because there wasn't any room but there's no room for you and if you remember the story james and john take offense for their lord's sake that they would do that to jesus and so you remember what they do they come to jesus and they said do you want us to call down fire and consume them you know like scriptural they really thought he would yeah let's go for that i've trained you in that right i mean said he said these words you know not what spirit you are of", "in others you're deceived you have the against sinful people who don't accept me who aren't accepting me i don't feel that way at all i didn't come to condemn them but to save them don't you know that you know not what spirit you're of john it's interesting to me then fast forward past pentecost into acts 8 philip has gone and done ministry in samaria people are getting saved but the spirit of god has not yet come but peter and who john john must come up and now pray for the to come upon those very people that he would have had burned out completely different he was bitter toward them but now he no he's filled with the holy spirit toward the same people he wants you know john becomes the apostle of love talks more about love here's a guy talk about changing something how about paul the apostle hatred prejudice toward christians and everybody else by the way as a pharisee but oh how the love of god transformed melted his heart grace is the supernatural sweetener exodus on wednesday night we've already actually looked at the passage but the children of israel are brought out of egypt you know by the passover through the red and in exodus 15 we have just if you're you know that we've just done the song of moses where moses is celebrating the salvation that god brought them so they're just brand new saved people and then after that the bible says in exodus 15 they read in the wilderness in and there's no water and you don't go very long without water before it starts to affect you and god watches to see what they'll do and what they do is they start complaining did you moses did you bring us out the lord bring us out here in the wilderness to kill us by thirst is that was that the plan now if i were god i would have gone yes no but maybe i wouldn't but he didn't do that um they're upset and now they focus on their spiritual leader can't see god so we'll deal with you moe you took a wrong turn where's the water are there camels coming from jericho where's the water uh well i just picture a million and a half people kind of walking toward him and go wait and it says moses cried out to the lord by the way always the 9-1-1 for every when you're in one of those situations you know like decreasing hold everything and he cries out to the lord and the bible is very interesting here it says", "and god showed him a tree now of course at that moment i'm thinking what is moses thinking ah yes the tree the tree that's of course the tree the water tree i mean what it doesn't say to that it just says god showed him and tells him to put the tree in the now i don't think the children visitors are going aha i've seen this back in egypt ever i think there's going somebody just he has lost it you're going to try to float away from us what do you anyway he puts the tree in the water and you know the story the bible says the the waters they could not drink because they were salty you see god had brought them i didn't mention this so they have no water god brings them to water that must have been exciting only to find out you can't it's like let's see what they'll do now right you know so i mean they're really but god says take that tree put it in the water and the waters become completely redeem the bitter to be a blessing to his people see this is joseph who's been sold by brothers to be a slave in egypt they actually sold them only because we might as well make a shekel off of him rather than kill him in the pit let's get rid of him and yet in looking joseph can see the grace of god in his life and he says to his brothers who are frightened that he's going to now kill them because he's second in command in all of egypt you meant it for evil there's no question it wasn't like you were going oh maybe we'll send him to egypt and he'll save us no nope you had rotten motives but god was superintending all of it and he meant it for good to bring about this work of salvation for our family and all of really the world could see the grace of god in his own life and he ministered grace to them it is the sweetener the sweetener look we can't help but see the cross in the tree do you have bitterness in your heart it's easy to get there really hard to get out there is one thing that'll take the bitterness out of someone's heart and it is the grace of god add the tree add the work of christ on the cross it's the only way that's why in every case when you struggle with forgiving somebody it's because you have forgotten what he's already done for you that's matthew 18.", "you can forgive anybody anything if you really know what he's already done for you you've already got a reservoir of we think on memorial day no greater man has a no greater love is a man than this than he lay down his life for his friends but think about it no greater love has a man than this but god's love is greater why because he didn't lay down his life just for his romans 5 8 says but god demonstrates his own love toward us in that while we were sinners we were his enemies christ died the love of god has reached down to you it has changed your life you are the bible says you're a trophy of grace or it gives that message it doesn't use the word trophy but you hear that what does it means that you and i as believers are proof that god is gracious do you know do you know this i can't tell you what you'll be doing a billion years from now or 10 trillion years from now but i can tell you it has something to do with you being saved by grace that's what the bible says in ephesians in the ages to come we've been saved so that god could show himself as gracious it'll forever be part of the purpose of why we were saved and partially that means god could reach down as low as well paul says there in 1st corinthians 15 when christ rose from the dead he to peter and to james and to a variety of 500 people at one time and then he says as to one untimely born last to me i don't even deserve to be in the christian family much less a leader i i persecuted the church i was worse than all of them and i am the chief sinner and the idea is if he could forgive me who who is it that thinks god's love couldn't reach to you of course it can grace is that supernatural sweetener now this is no guarantee that you can restore a relationship with anybody a person is bitter they may never change their heart toward you at all but again you have no right to not try or not pursue it but i can tell you this that if there's a problem between you and somebody else you're pursuing that may well change and say well bob that's the problem it's not somebody's mad at me it's i'm i'm mad at somebody i'm hurt by them i'm i don't want anything to do with them we jot down ephesians a jot down in", "32 be kind to one another tender hearted forgiving each other just as god in christ also has forgiven you can i just simply tell you the meaning of the word forgive in the original language there it's the greek it's very simple i jot it down you'll you'll use this the rest of your life and you'll use it with other people the word of fear me forgive literally is let it go release it let it go and that's what your pride and my pride doesn't want to yeah but they started it but they did way worse i know aren't you glad when you ask forgiveness the lord he doesn't say well you started it i never hurt you but you no as christ has forgiven you well we put in the word purity we're to pursue peace but we're also to pursue for his sake in our text in verse 14 and pursue sanctification without which no one will see the lord jump down matthew 5 8 blessed are the in heart for they will see god now sanctification is a word that you probably don't use much at all other than in church and in the i mean i know what it means but i don't tend to use it you know sanctify me one of those hamburgers wait i'm going to be coming back um the word sanctify simply means to be set it's it's the it's built on the root word hagias which means to be holy and it's the process of becoming holy or set apart now it gets confusing at this point because it sounds like you need to live holy or never making it to heaven that's not what it's teaching first of all i'm i'm a patriot but my uh passport will not get me into the kingdom of i've tried to live a good life but the bible says my righteous deeds are his filthy rags before god nicodemus was a moral man but jesus said accept your righteousness exceed that of the scribes and the pharisees you will in no in fact you won't even see the kingdom of heaven nicodemus unless you're born so here we're not talking about being holy enough to get us into heaven that's mistaken idea from the text jot down first corinthians 1 30 and i'll put that together for you this word sanctification first of all it says this by god's doing you are in christ jesus if you're a christian if you're born again who became to us god and he became righteousness and and redemption in other words we are sanctified we're already holy", "so here's the idea because of our faith in god the bible says in romans 5 having been justified made righteous by faith we have peace with god it's already done as far as god is concerned you're holy you're sanctified now the idea is what christ gives me in my position he wants me to grow in practically reveal god's at work within us to willing to do his good pleasure cr the holy spirit comes in to give you a spirit of he wants you to want to please god and to live out that holiness that we have in position in fact you might say it this way the idea here seems to be like this our holy living is the only way anyone will ever see the without holiness no man will see the lord that is in this life it's not talking about after we die down in san diego there's a church and vandals vandalized a statue of jesus they actually broke the hands off the some donor was willing to give the money to have it rebuilt and the church decided to put up a plaque that says he has no hands but ours the invisible god is seen in the way live jesus prays about it in john 17 that they may all be one that the world may believe that you sent me he said let your light so shine before men that they may see your good works but focus and glorify the father you see so our lifestyle as we live holy because of what he's done for us becomes a and people can see the lord put this down seek more of the lord himself it's easy to seek things from god lord i need a job lord i need a spouse lord i i've got a problem here i'm sick there's nothing wrong we're commanded to but you know when moses is given the opportunity to ask for anything he wants what does he want i would like a pyramid dedicated to my i want to see your face i want to see your face god what is that let me let me simplify it one of the evidences and symptoms that you're close to the lord because i don't believe anybody was as close to moses was on the planet one of the symptoms or evidences characteristics of somebody who's close to the lord is they want in a word more i want to be more intimate with you i i want to know you not just what you can you were made for god you're going to spend forever in his", "whatever that is face to face is an eternal value it will never get you will draw for it a lot of people just don't know that yet that it is the valuable thing we could ever have is intimacy with god seek more of himself we used to do a song you remember it i come to the unbended knee with just give me more of thee jesus take all of but give me more of thee paul says i do these things that i may gain christ not that i may gain salvation oh i have him but i want more of him shut down psalm 42 and verse 1 as the heart king james the deer pants for the water brooks so my soul pants for thee o god in second corinthians 7 1 before i have us look at it just let me remind you the context second corinthians 6 says don't be unequally yoked with unbelievers what right what partnership has light with darkness and he's talking about believers living a holy life and then he quotes the old testament where god said to his people come out from their midst referring to the pagan come out from their midst and be you and i'll be a father to you and you'll be sons and daughters to me in i want a deeper closer relationship with you but you're going to have to make about your relationship with this world and then he says in second corinthians 7 these words therefore having these promises what promises the promise of a closer relationship with god beloved let us cleanse ourselves from all defilement of flesh and spirit and perfect holiness separateness in the fear of god meaning i love him that's what the fear of god i love him look when i first got married i discovered my did not like uh it when i would crack my uh and i can crack my knuckles easily because i haven't done it in 50 years she was here for service i said i'm sorry the fact is when you love someone you're willing to choices and changes that you don't care about because you love them jesus said if you love me you will keep my commandments the book of jude the little postcard of an epistle one chapter long before the book second and last book of the bible describes many ways to fall away from as illustrated in the old testament there's lots of ways to fall away from i subtitle it there's must be 50 ways to leave your lover and there are lots of ways to fall away from god your sins", "your temptations are going to be different from mine the point of the book though is that he talks about different ways of falling away from god and then he gives us the one way to keep yourself from ever falling away and you know what he says there in jude he says keep yourself in the love of god because if you love me jesus said you know you'll keep my commandments you see perfecting holiness and the fear of god i want to be separate because i love you i'm not afraid of you god i'm afraid of hurting you because i love you so much i don't want to disappoint you or disobey you but it's seeking the lord himself put this down surrender to the lord not your lusts and then first corinthians 6 and verse 13 listen to what it says food is for the stomach and the stomach for food sounds like a commercial for but god will do away with both of them yet the body is not for the word is pornia in greek the body is immorality fornication but for the lord and the lord is for the body sometimes people will say pastor i just don't want to know i need to know the will of god for my life amen it's good to know there is a will of god and you can find it out i believe in that with all my heart i think much of the time the will of god is revealed in the word of god and god says you want to know my unknown will obey my known will and i'll give you my unknown will it always works that way walk in the light you have you'll have more light it's just true do what you know you'll know what to do but first we should start with what does god say his will is we should know that in first thessalonians 4 and verse 3 is one of those passages i want to know the will of god this is the will of god paul writes that is that you abstain from sexual immorality i remember i was in uh high school and i went down to calvary chapel costa mesa they were meeting in a tent they had saturday night concerts rock and roll songs about jesus it was an amazing time there wasn't much of that on the radio there was none of that on the radio there was no christian radio yet and uh i'll never forget uh the first was called sanctified and a guy named big bill sprouse big guy main singer been a country western", "singer and he'd gotten saved and and you you might know some of uh there's something like they sang a song that we call psalm 5 because the words are directly out of psalm 5 give here to my words oh lord anybody remember that one okay tom stipe used to say that god gave david the words of psalm 5 he gave the music to bill sprouse but we would worship the lord and then they would do this christian outreach and i'll never forget because i was in high school we invited sanctified to come up and do an outreach at el dorado high school during lunch us christians you know we were trying to get our friends saved and so they came up and they introduced themselves and i have told my friends awesome it's called sanctify they go our and i'm thinking to myself what the he's wrong i know he's the leader but he's anyway so i went up to him after he said bill i thought you guys were sanctified he goes well we were he said the problem most christians have no idea what that word means he said so we just changed it to the road home it's easier for people the fact is though that was almost 50 years ago but i'm not sure much has what does it mean to be sanctified it means to be set apart for god it means to be holy it means to be totally his surrendered to him it means to not be living a life to not be giving ourselves to our flesh and sexual sin is one of those ways that happens sexual sin by the way the word pornia or fornication in the new testament speaks of every kind of sin that you can do with sex outside of because it's really a description of all the sins of leviticus 18. it incorporates all of them it's not just pornography it's not just adultery it's any kind of sexual disobedience to taking sex outside the marriage relationship sexual sin will always quench the holy spirit it just does it's and it will always diminish our spiritual strength just think of samson remember we call samson the he-man with a she-weakness certainly david struggled with sexual sin it hurt his relationship to god it hurt his family it hurt his witness it jesus with the woman at the well is he's talking to her about living water how he if she knew who he was she would ask him instead of him asking her he'd give her living water and um she's asking him questions about that", "and talking about the difference from the jews and the samaritans and at one point jesus says go call your husband come on back and she says well um i'm not married and he says oh good answer actually you've had five husbands the guy you're with right now you're not married and she's like uh are you a private investigator you was she didn't know where she said sir i perceive you're a prophet you know let's talk about something else now it's interesting jesus did not bring up the fact that she was in sexual sin to shame her clearly if she was felt judged and condemned she would have never gone into and brought men not her not the guy she's with evidently i don't know back to be jesus she's attracted to the grace that he had for but he loved her too much not to mention it can i tell you you don't want to go to a doctor say well i got some deep heart problems i don't know what it is but it's really messed up doctor i've got a long my family has a big history of heart attacks and i i think i'm you know i don't know but it's hurting and you don't want that doctor to go let's work on how about one a day vitamins do that for six months and go are you gonna look no i don't do that i don't you know too invasive no no no the lord loves people too much to not deal with that which is hurting their relationship with god i i must have spoken about something to do with fornication and sexual sin i do from time to time and i'm focused on that but when it's in the word of god i mention it i met a couple recently who have started to attend our church they were here when i did that and i guess they were living together and it had been for some time but they had started seeking god and they turned to each other during the service when i had mentioned and they go we need to get married and by the way they are they got married they're living for the lord and they've decided to obey god and god's blessing their walk with him look the fact is don't ever think that we're trying to condemn you or bring scripture out to hurt anybody the talks about these things because he knows if you let the culture decide your morals you're going to be in huge trouble you already sometimes we're just ignorant we don't know it's just the way", "things are and so it says let no and it refers then to esau and it gives of an immoral man now he wasn't sexually immoral he was worldly look what it says in verse 16 there'd be no immoral or godless person like esau what did he saw that well he sold his birthright for a single meal if you remember the story in he's hungry he comes back from hunting his brother jacob says well you know he's cooking some beans up and and uh his brother said what is that red stuff yum me hungry and he says well to make your deal you give me your birth right you're the older of the two uh give me your birth bride and i'll give you a bowl of chunky beef deal what good is a stupid birthright to me if i'm dead you know and so he sells for one bowl of beans and he becomes an example because later on when his father gives the blessing to through deception the the firstborn esau comes in and realizes wait a minute my brother ripped me off and he's taking my blessing well come up with another one just make one up you have plan b blessing for me he goes i don't have another blessing for he said no i don't you you gave it up you sold out for for your flesh put this down stop leaving god out can i tell you something that i want you to remember because people think godless is some evil wicked sinner the word godless speaks for itself it just means leaving god out you can live a godless life as a christian how do you do that lean on your own understanding don't pray about things don't thank god for anything don't seek the lord joshua was leading the nation of israel he took some of the provision of the gibeonites who wanted to make a con a covenant with him and he never talked to the lord about it so he enters into this covenant with the people he was supposed to destroy didn't ask god anything he leaned on his owners to any of us can do that all of us can do that many of us do that godlessness is simply not acknowledging god not thanking god not asking god for permission leaving the lord out of our lives and by the way let me just say this because many people misunderstand the worshipping can come when it says that he could not get repentance this is not saying oh you've committed the unpardonable sin he didn't even really repent what it's", "talking about is this it's the attitude of i don't know how many of you been in jail ministries but i've been around a people who commit crimes and you know what i've noticed a lot of them really feel bad about what they've done after they're in my police car i shouldn't have done that oh i've ruined my life it's like now let me just great regret is not repentance judas felt great remorse he had betrayed brought the money back to the temple the silver and he went and hung himself but the bible says godly sorrow worketh repentance worldly sorrow worketh death the fact is esau never truly repented that door is always open for you simply feeling bad about your decisions and recognizing the cost is not true repentance and so we're just two things where to go after it not to be open to it where to go after it like a cop seeking a bad guy like i did i'm going after you till i get you one way or the other peace with people what does that mean for you you before the lord have to decide that today and holiness god i'm set apart for you i know i'm not going to be sinless even to the day that i die but i want to sin less and with your help lord i want to give you those areas that are hurting my walk with you let's all stand i want us to close in your love is greater your love is i hope you'll stay in fellowship with each other i hope you ladies will sign up for the women's retreat and i hope if you need to go to the prayer room to do some business with god the first place maybe is just to admit yeah lord there's somebody in my life and maybe mission is i don't want to be at peace lord you're going to have to change my heart by the way you don't have to have god change your heart to want to do his will before you do his that's a choice you can make jesus did not want to go to the cross aren't you didn't well if i don't want i'm not go you can obey the lord by faith but maybe you need prayer to be say god how i don't even know where to start with this has been a problem for and i i i'm afraid to humble myself or to even admit anything i've done wrong i it's fine just start with a desire to obey that'll honor god just before anything happens honor god", "with a desire and then tell him you're willing to if he'll help you now when i say may the lord bless you i want to ask god's grace you would not just be a trophy that you'd be a channel someone's going to offend you it's going to be soon you say bob it's 12 34 it's already you good someone's going to offend you might be today might be later today it might be tomorrow it's going to happen and you're gonna react i'm asking you to put a little reminder alexa put a remi that when the next time you feel offended you remember that you want and i pray you do want to be more like jesus because when somebody offends you it is your chance to be christ-like it is your chance to not give them in what they deserve but to give them grace to love them it won't come natural but if you will with god's help say that's what i want to make me more gracious with people who don't deserve it and maybe they're right there in your home they're your kids they're your spouse somebody you work with somebody on the road may god be gracious and through you for his glory god bless", "still be enough Lord we love you in your name I pray you gave your life for M nailed to the cross you crucify all my sin and Sh it was washed by your mercy you are the treasure I find my reason for living so let my life worthy all praise to the Lord most high all praise to the one who who saved my life all praise to Jesus Christ High King of heav marking

whole life now for you all praise to the Lord all praise to the one who saved my life all praise is name Jesus my king of heav my king forever the Bible teaches that worship at its most Essence if it's true worship involves when we think of worship as being truths we miss out by thinking well I'm worshiping the Lord because I'm acknowledging things that are true about him but there in the book of Romans it says that our reasonable service of worship is total consecration I like to say Worship in affectionate surrender the word worship", "in the Greek language literally is if we just translated it is to kiss toward God to give reverence to a King was to acknowledge Him as our Sovereign and so if we're worshiping the Lord we're doing more than admitting things that are true we're saying something about ourselves personally and that we want to actually hear from him obey him so we're about to receive communion and I'm looking forward to that but once again communion is easily I don't care what church you're from or part of can become just ritual not really an expression of anything that's going to change and so I I want to challenge us and encourage us and equip us and prepare us for taking a communion today you know Paul the Apostle writes this he says I want men everywhere in all the churches to lift up holy hands to pray lifting up holy hands you say well okay I'm supposed to raise my hand it's not about your hands being lifted that's fine but he then describes it this way lift up holy hands without wrath or dissension in other words the hands that I need to raise to praise God need to be empty maybe the empty of the things that I'm focused on just getting in the way of me really considering him sometimes it's empty just empty of my own plans I've got my own will of what I'm going to do do and I'm not sure what God wants but I'm focused on wanting what I want I hope God bless my will you know instead of Lord I want to discover and obey your will but it says without wrath that's anger or dissension that's arguing and maybe there's someone you're at odds with maybe you're ticked off at your son or your daughter your wife your husband and God's saying I I want you to let go of that if you're going to lift up holy hands then you got to let it go maybe the lifting up of hands is an expression of surrender I mean when I was a cop I said stick up your manosa I speak multiple languages of how to do that because we all know this you know this is like I'm I'm surrendered I'm not going to fight maybe maybe there's something in your life the Lord saying hey lift up holy hands in your heart surrender the problems that you're struggling with that you're mad about you don't just Just Surrender it to me it's an act of worship may not feel like an act of worship to you maybe it's disc", "enaging I I got to stop worrying about it if you're worrying about it you're not trusting him so I want to encourage you come to the Lord worship him for what he's done and express that by by some form of surrender to him this morning let's pray father you've got a work that you want to do in us and it's not just to take a little piece of bread and grape juice and remember something that happened historically it's beyond that we know you want us to apply it to ourselves personally and we do want to worship you we want to learn to Worship You Lord we want to worship you in a way that is received by you as true worship so help us to see what we're holding on to that we need to let go help us to love you for what you've done but also to demonstrate our surrender to you by letting things go thank you for the bread thank you for the cup in Jesus Worthy is the lamb who was slain holy holy is he sing a new song to him who sits on Heaven's Mercy SE Worthy is the lamb who was slain holy holy is he sing a new song to him sit on Heaven's Mercy Holy Holy Holy Holy is the Lord God Almighty who was and is and is to come with all creation I sing praise to the King of Kings you are my everything and I will adore you rainbows of Living Color flashes of light rolls of Thunder blessing and be to you the only King holy holy holy is

God everything I will Adore if you take your bread in your hand Jesus said to his disciples the night they were about to all of them blow it they were all going to sin that very night forsaking him him it didn't change what he thought about them and it doesn't change what he thinks about you you don't know your future he does he's not dealing with you based on your future failings and he's certainly not dealing with us based on", "our past failings Jesus Took the bread and he broke it he said this is my body given for you whenever you eat it me Lord your sacrifice take doesn't make okay our sin is still why you had to die our sin still brings dishonor to our God and brings damage into our life and our relationship with you and others your dying on the cross did not make sin okay but your dying on the cross made forgivable and completely able to be forgotten by a living God who is just and must punish sin but has now for us and so we stand in awe as we stand now in the grace of God ready to receive your mercies that are new this morning ready to admit we need them but really not to focus on ourselves at all but just to focus on you what a good God you are what an incredible savior you are we are amazed at your grace that we need that you have available right now right in this moment this morning so forgive us cleanse us wash us we receive it we accept it we need it and now Lord we want to do what you said said to that woman when you said go and sin no more Lord would you not only heal us from what sin has done what has ripped us off from restore to us the years the locusts of Eden that you might be glorified as a redeemer but then give us by the power of the Holy Spirit the power to say no to be set free from the sin to which we've been enslaved thank you for the cup in Jesus name after supper Jesus did bless the cup and he said this is the New Covenant in my blood every time you drink it me then Lord here we are the bride looking forward to the day that

teach the Bible we prepare it we have you present it and then we even give you the questions to discuss but it's using your home your apartment whatever it is for the glory of God and and it's a kind of a one andone you're not required to keep doing it many of the groups want to continue meeting we're not requiring that of you but if you're here and you've been coming to our church for a few months and you feel like I'm definitely a part of it I just know don't know how the Lord could use me maybe God has already given you the ability to be used this way we could really use your help go to our app and get more information and we'll get back with you to make sure that that's a good fit for you but we want you to join Community groups but if you're able maybe to consider hosting one and then we do a newcomers lunch many of you have been to it but it's really for anybody who's never been so maybe you've come to our church a long time never come you're invited but we need to know you're coming it's next Sunday after second service immediately after the service we'll we'll have lunch together the pastors and wives will be there and we", "just want to get to know you so give us that chance but we uh want you to tell us you're coming and how many meals to have ready for you because it's going to be a a free lunch and uh some time spent just enjoying some company hearing more about the Church of course but also hopefully getting to know you personally on a much better basis all right I'd like you to open your Bibles to the Book of Revelation we're still there we're not done with that book even close so why don't you open your Bible there go through the New Testament on Sunday mornings verse by verse we go through the Old Testament on Wednesday night at 7:00 but today in the Book of Revelation we've actually only covered one verse of the whole book so don't worry you didn't miss that much of the book but because it's stopped in the middle of a sentence with a comma I'm going to go back and read from the beginning the revelation of Jesus Christ which God gave him to show to his bond servant the things which must soon take place and he sent and he communicated it by his Angel to his bond servant John who testified to the word of God and to the testimony of Jesus Christ even to all saw blessed is He who reads and blessed are they who hear the words of the prophecy and blessed are they who heed the things which are written in it for the the time is near father we are coming to listen we are coming not just to listen but to live what we learn so Lord would you give us the ability to hear from you not just me but to hear directly from you from the passage of scripture we're in I pray you'd open our hearts to understand it to believe it and then to know what you want us to do with our Behavior because we have come to understand it so we love you we give you our study in Jesus name amen you can you might know this but every year there are literally millions of dollars spent by different scientific organizations that are seeking to find out if there is intelligent life outside of the earth Beyond man is there is there any intelligent uh life beyond humankind now there are some people who are wondering if there's any anyway but uh not sure why people like artificial intelligence to begin with but when it comes to this there are organizations that have radio telescopes they've been", "around for quite a while now maybe 50 years or so and they are probing the deepest parts of space trying to listen they're like listening ears that can go deep into space to to receive sounds and of course they're looking for patterns in the sounds that would give evidence that it's not just you know random themselves but some kind of a coded message that might be a message from some who knows other kind of Life Source out there it's even given rise this whole question of looking for alien life or intelligent life forces outside the Earth to what has been called the firery Paradox maybe you've never heard of that but the fery Paradox is actually uh it was a guy named verm who's who who brought it up some years ago and that deals with the discrepancy between the lack of conclusive evidence of advanced extraterrestrial life and what they consider the Apparently High likelihood of its existence and as a 2015 article put it this is it this is the the Paradox if life is so easy to come by someone from somewhere must have come calling by now and so there's a big question like is there any out there because at least thus far we have not found any proof of any intelligent life outside of mankind now I find it interesting that man spends all this money and all this time looking for some voice from outside of ourselves from some intelligent life force when the Bible claims to be exactly that the fact is the answer is there intelligent life absolutely we don't need to look for it in terms of some alien communication the Bible in the Book of Revelation tells us that this message came through not an alien but an angel there are intelligent life forces God's told us that he's created them and this message is not only through an angel but it is from God himself and in the text we're looking at today we're still at the beginning of the book before we get to the content of what's been revealed we're going to learn today that God has promised a blessing on the person who will receive this Revelation and really there's a blessing given to the person who will transmit it a blessing that you and I need to consider as John is mentioned as the one who received and transmitted the message so put this down first principle we want to be a faithful witness to Jesus Christ a faithful witness here in our text in verse one we are told that Jesus communicated this to his Angel and", "then to his bond servant John now if you weren't with us last week we talked about what a bonder servant was remember a bond servant is somebody who has no will of their own or they've resigned that will for the will of their master and John is called as we should be cuz it says this is written two bonds servants we talked about that last week but then it describes John this way he testified past tense to the word of God and to the testimony of Jesus Christ even to all that he saw so the Revelation was a vision he saw it it doesn't say he heard it doesn't say he read it he saw it and it's important for us to understand by the way this book is not the Book of Revelations it's the Book of Revelations singular usually somebody who hasn't really read it when they call it Revelations yes there are many things that are seen but it is One Singular Revelation it is the revelation of Jesus Christ and his purpose and plans for the church and for the future but it is singular the Revelation according to the scripture now put this down God's servant we see from the text receives revelation we want to realize this yet yet this message came to John but he is described in in the text as one who has already testified to the word of God and to the testimony of Jesus Christ now what is that talking about well let's remember John he is the Apostle John one of Jesus's disciples he wrote this approximately around 95 ad most of the other Apostles have long since Gone to Heaven he's the only last remaining alive Apostle by the way they were all martyred he survives and dies a natural death but here what's interesting to me is that we look at the life of John and the ministry of John in the Bible John as you know wrote three types of literature that are included in the inspired text there is the Gospel of John then there are the three Epistles of John and then of course this prophecy this word of Prophecy written at the end of the Bible it's interesting to think about those three types of literature that John gave us because they're all a little bit different John wrote the Gospel of John to present Jesus as the Savior by the way not just the Messiah of the Jews but the savior of the world he says so in the end of the book many more signs did Jesus do but these things", "have been recorded that you might believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God and in him have eternal life so John tells us he's written the gospel that he might present Jesus as Savior and what are we to do with it we're to believe then in the Epistles 1 second and third John which we have studied together a few months ago we realize that Jesus isn't just the Savior but he's also the sanctifier of those who are saved and there the point isn't written to get somebody to believe in Jesus for salvation it's written to people who already have so not that they would believe initially but so that they would listen to me be sure of their salvation remember he says so right there at the end of the book he you know these things have been written that you may know you have eternal life it's written to Believers so you can say am I a True Believer so the gospel so that would believe the Epistles so that we would be sure of our salvation and now the Book of Revelation John is going to present Jesus Christ as The Sovereign King The King of Kings and the Lord of lords and the message is be ready be ready for he is coming back now it's interesting each of the seven letters to the seven churches that we're going to study in the near future in the book at the end of each particular message to each Church to Ephesus merus Sardis Etc each message is given to a particular Church they're slightly different from each other it's a very unique message to each church but at the end of each one we have the same words that Jesus speaks let him who has ears to hear hear what the spirit is saying to the churches in other words while it's a message given to an individual Church Jesus says actually I want everybody to listen to each of those messages because I have something to say to you from every single one of them and so the Lord is giving Revelation Beyond just those particular particular churches that received them at that time but God's servant is described as one who receives revelation you know one of my classes I had to take in college was speech I almost dropped out of college because of that I was terrified that I didn't want to get up ever in front of anybody God's kind of changed my life huh but at that time I was terrified of it and uh so I dropped the class the", "next time I went to the councel and said what can I do other than speech they said you need to take speech oh great so I took it again one of the one of the speeches we had to do was an in informational speech which has got to be the most boring speech in the world you know it's like you get up and you talk about something that people already know about and you explain it and so I decided to do mine on the CB radio I was into CB radios when I was in college and I had this handheld big walkie-talkie it was a CV radio and you know big antenna and I made a big chart that a big picture of it and I had little arrows going you know this is the volume this is the squelch this is the transmitter this is the antenna these are the champion just like yeah so I was supposed to give this information and I thought that is just a boring speech I don't know why anybody would have to do these so um I I at one point during my speech I I explained you turn it on right here it's onoff switch and I turned it on and I said that's static that you're here Ing and uh and so then I explained to him now this transmitter button is what you got to push if you want to communicate or try to communicate and I said you know you might say something like breaker breaker is there anyone out there and that's kind of CB language you know and uh and as I demonstrated that somebody else came back talking to me during my speech breaker they said what's your 1020 which I happen to know means what's your location I go uh I I said they're asking me my location I said uh I'm I'm in Fullerton right now at Fullerton College in a speech class and the person said who's your professor I said I said his name is NL Gilbert he goes oh that's a terrible Professor he's awful I turned it off really quick and well that was my friend down the hall that was set up for that moment well I got a on the speech but students loved it anyway my point of sharing that silly story is this you can study a radio you can take it apart but if you never turn it on and you never tune it in you're not going to receive nothing too often the Bible and too often prophecies are things people study to understand them but they're not", "receiving anything why the message is given to those who won't just receive it but actually are willing to to do something with it put this down to Bear witness you must become one it says that John bore witness as he testified to the word of God and to the testimony of Jesus Christ you're not a witness of what learned you're not a witness because of what you know intellectually biblically you're not a witness even because of what you believe theologically you're only a witness because of what you've experienced personally can't get up in a court and talk about the things you know I mean yes they have expert Witnesses who do that but you can't bear witness to whether something happened or not you actually have to have a personal experience you know when I was a police officer I'd be dispatched to accident calls all the time and I would go there there' be couple cars usually and hopefully nobody's injured but I got to my job is to make sure people are safe that are driving and that they're safe and I'm going to take a police report and try to figure out what happened whose fault was it it was always interesting to talk to the two drivers they usually had a very different opinion about that and so did the people in their car who usually voted for the driver but anyway that was my job to try to decipher based on the evidence what happened but I would always look for Witnesses now quite often there were plenty of people that saw it but they were like already gone by the time we got there they'd see us coming go I'm out of here I don't have time to mess with that but there were always a few people that were hey hi officer and I would say did you see the accident oh yeah do you were a witness yeah uh well tell me what happened well I was in my house and I heard the screeching of tires and the horn and the Crash so I came running out I said wait a minute wait a minute you didn't see the a well I did I right after that I came right out no you're not a witness to the accident you may have been a witness to something right after the accident but you can't I don't need you to understand what I need to know don't I don't want to give don't tell me what you think happened with the light and anything else you see the question really is this", "are you a witness of Jesus Christ remember what he said to his disciples by the way who were very interested in end times things this is in the book of Acts after Jesus rose from the dead they realized he was the Messiah and in their minds the Bible says well Messiah is going to establish his kingdom on the earth a forever Kingdom son of David he's come back to rule so I we didn't get the cross thing but now we get it okay let's go and they said this is it at this time that you're going to restore the kingdom to Israel remember Israel had been a kingdom One Nation then it got separated into two kingdoms remember that after Solomon's son and then of course there were no kingdoms as the Assyrians came in and wiped out the Northern Kingdom of Israel the Babylonians came in and wiped out the southern Kingdom and even though they came back they were always under some other power and by this time now they're slaves to Rome they don't really have kingdom have a puppet King named Herod who just does the bidding of Rome so they said is it at this time you're going to restore the kingdom to Israel and Jesus said it's not for you to know times or epics Seasons which the father has fixed by his own authority but you will receive power when the Holy Spirit has come upon you and you will be my Witnesses Jerusalem right where you are Judea Samaria the remotest parts of the earth you are to be my Witnesses he didn't say you're to go witnessing no no you are my you know some things you've experienced things you've seen me you see and this is what is being said of John when it says he testified to the word of God you say what's that talking about well remember how he begins his gospel in the beginning was halagas the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God verse 14 of that same chapter and the word halagas became flesh and he tabernacled or dwelt among us and we beheld his glory glory as of the only begotten of the father in other words we saw him ourselves this is exactly what Peter says you can jot it down second Peter 1 and: 16 with regard to his ministry of the Gospel he says we talking about the apostles and the followers of Jesus we did not follow cleverly devised Tales when we made known to you the power and the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ but", "we were what is it say it out loud eyewitnesses we were eyewitnesses of his majesty he goes on and say we were on mountain Peter James John we we heard the voice of God this is my son son listened to him we saw him transformed we saw Moses we had a personal experience and so it's important to say Lord I do want to be a faithful witness but then the question becomes are you have you become a witness you say what do you mean remember in Romans 8 it says this when you become a Christian the Holy Spirit comes to live inside you and the Bible says his Spirit listen to me Bears witness with our spirit that we're children of God there's an inner reality to the truth that you've learned the logically an evidence that you've actually met the Lord and he starts transforming you from within put this down number three God's servant transmits all they receive I don't know if you picked that up in verse two John is already testified to the word of God and to the testimony of Jesus Christ even you might want to Circle it to all that he saw you know John not only bore witness in the Gospel of John to his own experience but if you read the Epistles he did the same thing remember how he begins first John what was from the beginning what we have heard what we have seen with our eyes what we beheld with our own hands concerning the word of life and what we have seen and heard we Proclaim to you also that you also may have fellowship with you need to have the same experience that we have but he transmitted he shared it with other people and I believe if receive Revelation from God this is a principle in the Bible we need to be willing to share it with other people I think of Abraham there in the Old Testament and God is visiting with Abraham in Genesis 18 if you want to jot it down there's two verses there Genesis 18:17 and Genesis 18:19 and God says this this is a fascinating statement of the Lord the Lord said shall I hide from Abraham what I'm about to to do Abraham is a believer in God and God is about to destroy Sodom and Gomorrah and we know that lot one of Abraham's nephews is living in Sodom gomorra and God says shall I hide it from him and then he says this in Genesis 18 and verse 19 I have chosen him Abraham", "so that he may command his children and his household after him to keep the way of the Lord by doing righteousness and Justice so the Lord may bring upon Abraham what he has spoken about actually in the King James God makes it clear I'm going to share it with him because he will share it with his descendants I find that fascinating in fact the reason John is on the island of patas well he talks about it in verse 9 let's skip ahead verse 9 I John your brother and fellow partaker in the tribulation and Kingdom and perseverance which are in Jesus I was on the island of patmas because of the word of God and the testimony of Jesus in other words I've been faithful to share that that's why I was on the island to begin with and because I've been faithful to share now God's going to reveal this is all through scripture when we share what we've been given God gives us more many of you know my story I won't tell the whole thing this morning but how my wife and I began our relationship we went out a a date uh we went to breakfast really and uh nothing really seemed to be we had a good time but it wasn't like we were in love it was just a wonderful friendship kind of thing but the lord gave me a a sense in my sleep that things weren't exactly right with Becky and so it was really awkward I didn't know her that well and I thought it would be strange for me to tell her that God was telling me things about her so I I wasn't sure I wanted to do that but God kept impressing my heart that I should pray for her so when I finally did get some time with her the next time I said you know I really need to share with you some things that are on my heart that God revealed to me and it was pretty General it was that she was far from God which I had no way of knowing except the Lord put that on my heart cuz certainly she didn't say anything like that I didn't know that and that he wanted her back that was it pretty straightforward so she and I went out to coffee and she said well what was it that God showed you and I remember thinking man God you better be right be really embarrassing if you're wrong cuz I'm looking like a dummy just even saying it you know so I stalled until I couldn't stall", "anymore she said well what was it that God told you about me I said all I know is God Must Love love you an awful lot I said I'm really a total stranger you don't know me at all you have other people in your life I know your parents are missionaries that love you and I know you have other Christians in your life so why he would now I know why but I didn't then because it didn't look like our relationship was going anywhere in particular you know so I shared with her I said God ministered to me last night that he loves you and you're far from him and he wants you back and as I said that phrase literally at that moment not one second before I more and so I just kept talking which you know I have a gift of but it wasn't because of that but when I said God loves you and you're far from him and he wants you back I knew more I said and I know that last night you went out with a guy he asked you to marry him and you said yes and she her mouth dropped open and she started weeping she said that's all true but how did you know it being the spiritual giant I am I said I idea I just found out a second ago myself I lit I know this sounds strange to you you don't even believe it happened I lived it it happened well now I know God had a plan for her and us to be together but it started with him wanting to reach into her life and to demonstrate it was God in a way that only God could do but here's my point I I didn't know it at the time but by me being faithful at sharing the tiny bit of information I had that was when God would then give me more do you remember remember when Hannah who wanted a son couldn't have one was blessed actually through the prayers of Eli who was kind of a backslid high priest at the time and God brings her the desire of her heart and she has a little boy and she dedicates him to the Lord his name is Samuel His Name by the way means Asked of the lord it's name means prayer request prayer answered and so she makes this commitment to dedicate him to the Lord for his whole life I me we we do baby dedications here we do child dedications all the time parents that say I want to raise my kid in the", "Lord that's great but this one can you imagine if parents when they dedicated their child to the Lord after a few months you they bring the baby back here you go Pastor bye well she brings her son Samuel and when after he's weaned maybe at the age of three or four back to Shiloh where Eli is and says here you go he's he's yours for the rest of his life and Eli accepts this gift and little Samuel becomes a a servant to Eli he's just a little boy helping whatever four-year-old could do you know learning how to help the the high priest and one night little Samuel is going to bed and he hears a voice and the voice is his own name Samuel Samuel he thinks it's Eli so he runs Eli goes you called me he goes I didn't call you I'm go to bed you know and Samuel goes back to bed and he hears the same thing Samuel Samuel so he runs back to El you you called me said I I didn't but something stirs I believe believe in Eli's memory cuz Eli doesn't hear from the Lord at this time sounds like maybe he used to cuz Eli knows what the boy needs to do and he tells them the next time you hear that voice crying out your name Samuel here's what I want you to say say these words to that person who's calling you speak Lord listening and he does and God speaks to this boy and what he reveals to him actually has to do with Eli and the sin of Eli the high priest of Israel that God is going to judge him and his house because of his Disobedience and the way he's not rebuking his sons who are in sin God tells this little boy and then the next day Eli says so what did God say to you and I'm sure s was going I don't really want to share that with you and Eli senses it and he says you tell me everything that God spoke don't hold back any of it or what was being told you will happen to you he seems to know that God is speaking to him it's about him and it's not good but he wants to hear it he's willing to hear it and so Sam this little boy tells Eli the whole thing Eli does accept it even though he's in sin as a word from God and the Bible says from that point on in little Samuel's life he became a prophet of God", "and God never let one of his words fall to the ground never fail God started revealing a whole lot more to him you got to be faithful with what God gives you you need to be doing more than just studying it for yourself you need to be sharing it with others and God says I'll give you more but you're going to have to be faithful John was God servant they receive put this down letter b resp respond to God's invitation of Revelation put in the word invitation look at verse three now here's the the the carrot blessed is He who reads and those who hear the prophecy and heed the things which are written in it for the time is near by the way this is the first of seven Beatitudes uh in the Book of Revelation remember there are eight Beatitudes in The Sermon on the Mount where Jesus said blessed are those who mourn blessed are the merciful Etc blessings some translated happy or probably better fortunate uh blessed by God is the idea is the person who does these three things now we're going to go through them briefly because some of it you're doing right now by showing up at church but put this down expect to be blessed by reading this book this prophecy not just the Bible generally there are blessings that come to us when we spend time in the word of God read Psalm 1 how blessed is the man who does not walk in the counsil of the ungodly but he meditates in the law of the Lord day and night he'll be like a tree firmly planted by rivers of water bringing forth its fruit and its there's a blessing in the word of God make no mistake but there's a unique extra blessing that's given in this book that's only given in this book for those who will read the words of the prophecy I can literally say frankly you can too you can tell people hey come to my church next Sunday I guarantee you you'll be blessed because we not because of the pastor he might blow it but God's going to bless you man we're going to be reading a promise of God that he says he'll bless you simply by reading this particular part of the Bible now it's an interesting word to read it's the word Anna ganoso I don't expect you to know Greek but I try to teach you a little bit along the way an Anna is a Greek preposition that means again genosco is the word that means to know the word to", "read means to know again to have it be gone over again or to spend time not just reading it once but reading it again and again actually means literally to have it read out loud if you want this blessing you were to read it and to read it out loud and here's why you see the early church would have readers because many people couldn't read so they had to have the word of God read the Cantor the even in the synagogues they did basically the early church what the synagogues would do they would have a reader remember Jesus went into the synagogue took the scroll of Isaiah and he read it out loud that's what they did they would read it especially for those people who who couldn't read but there's a blessing for the reader so I'm getting blessed just getting to read it to you you today and God's saying I want to bless you just by spending time to read it but I want you to notice something that a lot of people Miss at this point in the text and in this blessing it says blessed is He who reads the words of the prophecy please notice it I have mine underlined you don't have to but the words of the prophecy the blessing is not upon those who understand the themes of this book and it's not a blessing on those who have the correct interpretation of the book A lot of people get divisive about interpretations of Prophecy well I think it's this well I think it's that let's argue that out you know by the way God hates those who sow Discord among the Brethren so I try to stay far away from those things that are going to divide us and it is true some people won't study this book there are so many interpretations of the Book of Revelation you know what uh we are not commanded to interpret the book I will give interpret ation long way but that's not my primary goal in fact my interest is not primarily in interpreting The Book of Revelation to you as much as it is to discover what God has said it is his words the blessing is tied to the interpretations can often be very confusing you hear something Mary had a lamb how did she do that never seen a girl with a having a little any what does that exactly mean you know people get confused somebody says hello to me hey how you doing what did you mean by that when you said hey how you doing is that like you know", "what's going on in my life or interpretations people get confused I am convinced that God says what he means and means what he says we simply need to read what he said the words the blessing is on the words not well if it agrees with my particular form of eschatology I'll be blessed that's not where the blessing is from so expect to be blessed just by reading it and then put this down discover the blessing of hearing it of hearing it and this is talking about audibly hearing it why is hearing the word of God so important rather than just reading it well among other reasons is what is said 10:17 here's what Paul wrote faith comes by hearing it could have said reading it doesn't faith comes by hearing and hearing by the word of Christ or hearing concerning Christ you know I remember back when I was at Bola University a friend of M mine Mike sturgeon who memorized a lot of scripture he had memorized the whole book of Romans verbatim and so he invited us all who everybody wanted to to come in and he did a a recitation of the whole book of Romans audibly for us it was amazing and it was different you know I had studied Romans I had taken Romans I taught Romans but I never heard the book of Romans spoke spoken audibly out loud all in one sitting it was a we actually took a break we took an intermission at Romans 8 cuz we had to take a little break but literally of course most of us were there with our Bibles making sure you didn't miss a comma you know but I well be a Pharisee but it it was uniquely a blessing and so many Christians have actually never heard the word of God read out loud maybe you have an audible Bible maybe you do on the way to work praise God but this book is saying hey you need to hear it don't just read it if you want the full blessing and I think well I do so I find that interesting because if you think about it you know there is a difference think about it this way you get a phone call from somebody do we still even make those anyway you make a phone call you get a phone call versus a text message oh I know everybody prefers text text make no commitment to have any awkward further conversation then know tie up your time I I know why we do it I just find it interesting that people", "want less and less real relationship I shouldn't find that so strange but that is the nature of people but when you have a phone call with somebody there are some Clues many times as to what people mean just the inflection of their voice whether they're excited about something you don't get that usually in a text message in fact sometimes it's just kind of there's some ambiguity somebody something me you're not well I'm not sure exactly did they mean to write that is did they miss uh you know sometimes my my text messenger you know possessed I have sent some horrible text messages you know um I have an email if I push go it gives me time to repent to undo they need to create a text message that does that cuz there are sometimes I've cussed at people and I thought that was not what I said whoever you are Siri wash your mouth you know I'm literally just like I maybe aake shouldn't be doing it while I'm riding my motorcycle cuz the sound of the engine makes it sound like a cuss I don't know I did it once I did it again I thought I'll forget this I'm just cussing somebody out um but the fact is when you hear someone's voice it can remove that somebody text you you know they just send you back and answer your question uh about something they yep she going is that is that was that supposed to be yep or is that like you're sick that I'm asking it because it sounds like you're having a bad day over there I don't or maybe it's just m you don't know so there's some benefits of hearing it and by the way if if you are interested in doing this you don't have to download a Bible app because on our church app I recorded Revelation 1 um for you to listen to yes it's my voice so at least you'll know who you know I'm reading it so I get blessed cuz I'm reading it the Bible says so and hopefully you'll get blessed by just listening to it I've been listening to myself I'm blessing myself it's the Lord's blessing me through my voice it's not the voice though it's not me it's actually him it's his word it's his promise so take advantage of that and put this down number three God's blessing is on those who obey we think of the Book of Revelation primarily as this revelation of what's going to happen in the future and yet there are many things within this book", "that God's saying now will you give heed to it that's what this word means by the way to take heed to the things written is an interesting Greek word it's the word t which is translated to observe or to guard or to obey when Jesus said Make Disciples of all the nations baptizing them in the name of the father Son and the Holy Spirit and teach them to here it is observe it's actually this word to to obey to keep not just to learn learn the words but to do what I'm saying and the Book of Revelation has many commands there when we study these seven churches we're going to find out there's many things Jesus says now here's what I want you to do you've left your first love here's what I Repent remember from where You' have fallen do the deed you there's commands given to us all through this book you're thirsty let him come and Dr there's commands so the Lord is saying now if you want the blessing you want a One blessing read it want Another Blessing listen to it you want Another Blessing obey it and of course we know that that is always a part of why God gives his word it's been said to hear God's word is privilege to keep it as a duty but Jesus said this concerning his teachings if you know these things blessed are you if you do them see the problem is we just stop me oh if I know these I'm just blessed because I know them my friends don't know them so I can kind of show up you know no no no no the blessing isn't in knowing it the blessing is only attached to doing it remember the difference of the wise men and the foolish man wasn't the one who knew the word of God the one who heard the word of God they both heard the word of God one who hears my voice hears my words and acts upon them he'll be like the wise men the other guy's a he knows the word he hears the word he doesn't do anything with them that's why James says don't deceive Yourself by being merely a hearer of the word and not a doer of the word what's the deception well because I've now heard a sermon I understand I got I was I enjoyed I could share with my friends and I know more than they do and I'm growing in my faith well actually you're deceiving yourself if you just keep hearing and hearing and you're not doing anything different", "total deception so blessed is the person who hears and does Luke 11: 27 and 28 listen to what Jesus said to somebody who was trying to give a compliment to him he came about while Jesus said these things one of the women in the crowd raised her voice and said blessed is the womb that bore you and the breasts at which you nurse in other words man your mom's blessed to have a kid like you but he said on the contrary blessed are those who hear the word of God and keep it this A same Greek word observe it do it the blessing is doer years ago I heard a story of a of a church that was looking for a new pastor and so they called this guy they knew he was a great preacher and they had heard him preach somebody had heard him preach so they had him come and the whole little town gathered the Christians that went to that church anyway all showed up that Sunday and he preached a great message it was phenomenal people were like wow that was awesome and so they went out and told their friends you got to come this new guy is excellent and so a lot of new people came the second week the only thing was the pastor that had preached the message the last week preached the exact same sermon verbatim and the new people thought this guy is great wow and they people yeah well third week the people that came the second week invited some new friends the people that came the first week didn't and yet the place was really overflowing and same exact sermon the third time afterwards the elders and deacons got the new pastor he go hey hey it was great especially the first time um don't you have any other messages he goes oh I've got a lot more but you haven't done anything with the first one that I gave you now we think oh that would be that's a silly story but how many of us are just content to just keep studying we we're not doing that with it we're just going to keep reading keep studying because it's enjoyable to learn more be careful that you don't fall into that trap and then under letter C put this down realize it's high time to become and remain engaged in our text it says this at the end of verse three the blessing is if you read hear and heed near what's talking about it's time of Christ's return the time of these coming things coming to pass", "the time is near Romans 13: 11 and 12 Paul talks about the same thing about being obedient love one another it's our only real commandment there in Romans 13 if you love you won't have to have a list of dos and don'ts you'll fulfill the law and then he says and this doe knowing the time it's already the hour for us to awaken from sleep wake up for now salvation is nearer to us than when we first believed the night is almost gone Dawn is Breaking the day is at hand let us therefore lay aside the Deeds of Darkness put on the armor of light the Bible goes on to saying make no provision for the flesh with regard to lusts the fact is the Bible says these things his coming is near now I know people stumble at this at this point it's like well wait that was like long ago people say you know people have been saying Jesus is coming back for a long time God's going to judge the world they've been talking about that for centuries and here we are Peter is talking about the last days and he says you know what's going to happen the last days mockers will come with their mocking and you know what they're going to say where's the promise of his coming for all things have remains so when people say you guys you Christians you've been saying that for years you say well actually he prophesied that you'd be coming along to say that that was one of the signs we were in the end is people like you say where is the promise of his coming we say well yeah but he did promise and come it's been 2,000 years do you remember what Moses says see in Psalm 90 he wrote One Psalm but it's a powerful one and Psalm 90 is about God's eternality and our transitoriness we don't live we've not been alive forever we were conceived and we've lived and then we stop our Earthly lives and that's all we've known is a very short brief brief period of time but he says God on the other hand from Everlasting to Everlasting you're God God says in the Old Testament prophets I eternity in other words I his perspective on time is very different from ours and so in that Psalm is where Moses says you know a thousand years in your sight is like yesterday when it passes it's just it's a blip you know it's not really that long of a time but for us it's crazy about a time our our", "it's very relative our perspective on time God in the book of Isaiah challenges those people who believed in other gods hey prove that you guys have have really worshiped other gods these Idols by letting your Idols tell you the future go ahead tell tell us what's going to happen because they can't he said I alone am God and I declare the end from the beginning because God dwells in eternity he sees he knows everything that's going to happen now that's very difficult for us to understand because that's not our perspective Pastor Chuck used to use I think it's a great illustration um I don't know if you've ever been been to the Rose Parade how many of you have ever been to the Rose Parade past okay you should go just so you can be freezing like us and pay your dues um if you've ever been to the Rose Parade maybe you had the privilege of you know Colorado and lake is a good intersection because it turns right there and you watch the parade and if you're watching these floats go by you know in real time there's one and there's another one coming but you got to wait 5 10 minutes and then another one comes and stops and they do their thing and oh man they were great and just that's the way life is succession of events that's the way time is us but the illustration is this that God who dwells outside of time isn't is above that in terms of his perception of all of history and all of future of all of eternity he doesn't dwell he he doesn't dwell you know his name is Yahweh I don't know if you know this you know what Yahweh is that name it means I am but it doesn't just mean I am that's part of what it means it comes from the Hebrew being verb ha which means to exist he is he is he was and he is to come all at the same time which is beyond our capacity doesn't make sense to us but if you were watching the Rose Parade not at Lake in Colorado but from the Goodyear blimp they've been doing it for 60 years by the way uh here's an image of the goody your blimp over that area okay you could see the whole parade at the exact same time whereas we're looking at float after float after float if you were up there you'd see it all simultaneously say oh there's the you time to you it's happening at the same time you could describe", "it God is able to declare the things that are yet future as though they're happening right now it's not a problem for him because he's not limited and so he sees things that are going to happen and he can describe he says that's proof that I'm God by the way and then he's revealed it to us so that we might honor him and not be shocked by the things that are going on in our world you know in the scriptures have teachings about the world about technology and many about the nation of Israel and the Book of Revelation has a lot to say to us about that for instance in the Bible we are taught from prophecy the Jews at some point would be scattered throughout the world they were a nation but God told them and before they even became a nation if you don't obey me I'm going to scatter you throughout the world well that all happened through the Assyrians and the Babylonians and then through the Romans the Jews were scattered literally physically all over the world there are Jewish populations in every continent did you know that there are people that have never been Israel but they're Jewish all kind of skins all kinds of languages All Over The World God promise we are told by God that the nation of Israel would be regathered after being scattered for many years they would be regathered to their Homeland and that they would be reborn again as a nation by the way it even says can a nation be born in a day that's exactly what happened on May 14th 1948 as Israel which had ceased to be a nation for 2,000 years was born again literally literally they're not born again spiritually but they're born again physically became a nation never happened before in all of human history that a nation that ceased to exist came back to existence ever God promised in the book of Zephaniah that the ancient language of Hebrew which was a dead language for centuries would actually come back to life it is children over in Israel they learn Hebrew they don't learn Hebrew as some secondary language they learn Hebrew as their primary language it's been completely brought back it's an amazing thing he promised that the barren mountains of Israel would be blessed and bear fruit as they used to but no longer were for centuries and now Israel is fulfilling a prophec in the Old Testament that it would produce fruit for the whole world if you go to Europe today and you get an orange", "at a store you're probably are buying an orange that was produced in Israel a Jaffa orange you think of Florida orange they're they're Joff oranges Joff is right there in Israel it's an amazing prophecy all fulfilled already happened in our day a lot of people have no idea about these things and that God would bring his people back from all over the world and primarily from the direct north of where Israel is whereas the first Exodus was from Egypt God says so in the Old Testament yeah they came from Egypt but this time they're going to come from the extreme North vast majority of people who have returned to Israel have come from Russia did you know that the former Soviet Union and from all over the world God says I'm going to bring them from all over the world I'm going to put them back into their own country and I'm going to bless them they're going to be populated again as they used to be we know the population in the ancient world we know their population now God has done exactly what he said he would do I could go on for way too long but I just want you to know there's lots of prophecies in the Bible regarding the land of Israel by the way the city of Jerusalem God says there's a prophecy Jerusalem Jesus said would be trotted underfoot by the Gentiles until the fullness of the Gentiles are fulfilled Jerusalem was still under Jordanian control until 1967 some of you weren't born yet some of you weren't born again yet but Jesus said this was a prophecy concerning the end times that Jerusalem would be controlled not by Israel but by Gentiles that all changed in the six- day war it's an amazing prophecy that has been fulfilled I'm thankful that the capital of Israel is now recognized by the United States since Donald Trump moved the embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem presidents both sides promised to do that for years nobody did it grateful God said this is going to be and then there are prophecies in Zechariah and elsewhere about how Israel is going to be a trouble to the rest of the world in fact there's prophecies that say the world's going to hate Israel did you know that isn't it interesting since October 7th how much anti-Semitism was already there it just needed an excuse to come out it didn't create it it just showed it and the Bible says in the end all nations by the way including this one cuz that's part", "of all will be against it Israel now I'm thankful we're not yet very grateful we're an ally of Israel glad we're helping them in this current conflict but sometimes people see what's going on in the world they get freaked out what's going on you is this is Jesus coming back today well I don't know when he's coming back because we're not told exactly when he's coming back he could come back today but I believe Christians are not to be alarmists we should be alarm clocks we should be telling us Paul said hey the night is far gone the day is at hand so jot this down how do we remain engaged in a way that honors the Lord first of all be rejoicing as your wedding day approaches be rejoicing Revelation 19: 7 and 8 if you're taking notes jot down Revelation 19 verse 7 and 8 let us rejoice and be glad and give the glory to him for the marriage of the Lamb has come and his bride has made herself ready and it was given to her to clothe herself in fine linen bright and clean for the fine linen is the righteousness of the Saints you should be excited about your day and our day is coming we're not to be filled with some kind of a frightful expectation we're to be filled with a joyful expectation and anticipation then be ready because your king is coming be ready for your king is coming you know in the Gospel of Luke when they came out to ask John who are you because John was baptized in more people than anybody and everybody knew he was they didn't know who he was the Jews a lot of thought he was the Messiah uh so they sent the Pharisees sent out some people to ask them some questions who are you what do you say about yourself what's your position and they just finally said are you the Messiah and he said no hoping you were hoping you were claiming to be anyway are you then the prophet who was to come a reference to a prediction in 18 He said nope well then are you Elijah because Malachi says Elijah's coming before the Messiah NOP well then what do you say about yourself who actually are you he said well I'll tell you who I am I am the voice in the Greek it's Fon the sound I'm the voice of one crying in the way make straight the ways of the Lord let every Mountain be brought low let every Hill every Valley be raised up", "because the king is coming I'm here to get you ready for your Messiah I'm not the Messiah I'm I'm not even worthy to untie his sandal but he's coming and you're not ready folks do do you understand that God was using John in an incredible way and he did not want any attention on himself remember what he said he Jesus must increase I must decrease when a king would come to visit a town or a city the repairmen would go ahead of the visit of the king and repair the roads they didn't want the king to be on his way in his Chariot and have some tree knocked down oh we should have dealt with that that's a little embarrassing for the town no no all this work had to be done to get ready for that King to come and he said I'm just the voice of I don't you don't even need to know my name basically just I'm just a I'm just a voice I do believe that it's possible for Christians even to get excited what is this mean this attack from Iran is that do that mean Jesus is about to come I think it's possible that we can see things related to signs and misread the signs Bible does predict that Iran Persia will be part of an invasion attempt on Israel that God will defeat in the Book of Ezekiel 38:39 we know that they will be an enemy of Israel in the future they are now they're attacking Israel that's unprecedented but that's not the Fulfillment of Ezekiel 38-39 you know um my wife and I when we first got married I was a police officer in the city of Placentia and um we had not long after we got married she got pregnant we nine months later had a son Jesse and little baby in our two-bedroom apartment and I remember one night she woke me up out of a dead sleep and she was terrifying she said wake up she because there's somebody's in the baby's room there's somebody's in the baby's room and I thought I mean I that's what I woke up to in the middle of the night someone's in my house you know and so I I didn't know I I jumped out of bed I police I don't know why I said it I just did like I don't know if I was identifying myself or calling for him but I that's what I came out of my police and I went to the baby's door the baby's room door was shut I looked for a", "weapon I found it it was a little one egg saucepan that the baby had been playing with on the ground in the hall and I picked that up like all right that's all I got so I opened the door like that and there was nobody there we have a glass door I think oh they go out the back Becky what did he look like well I didn't see him what she said no I went to the door and as I tried to open the door to see check the baby he was he was pushing back on the door I go are you talking about the door sticks in the nursery oh it yeah you can freak out about signs and misread signs and and you become Chicken Little but if Christ coming back soon freaks you out I have a question for you why remember in the Book of James he says don't judge each other or hold grudges against each other for the judge is standing at the now when you hear the authorities are at the door if I'm in a room with some people say the cops are outside they're coming in they're at the door now if that freaks you out it's because you're wrong now if you're being held at gunpoint and you go the cops are at the yay so how you react to the fact that he's so close to coming back probably says something about you because for the believer he's not just the judge and by the way the judgment is about getting rewards the judge is at the door woohoo it's finally here not about condemnation there's no condemnation for those that are in Christ so if it freaks you out that Jesus could come back at any time it's probably a a wakeup call to you hey why is that SC scare you why does that frighten you is he not your savior and your lord is he not your bridegroom cuz my judge is my bridegroom my best friend my Lord and Savior who's already proven that he loves me I can't wait to see him face to face I'm not afraid of him are you afraid of him then you're not mature in love perfect love casts out fear so finally be resolved to stay occupied until he be resolved to stay occupied until he comes you know people do look at signs like well does this mean anything prophetically that Iran is attacking Israel let me remind you of together you guys can stand if you will too Jesus said this when you see these signs begin to", "happen freak out cuz your condemnation is near no he didn't say that he said up your Redemption things are looking up you guys your Redemption is Drawing Near you can be excited about the fact that we're seeing not the events described in Ezekiel but previews of things that must be in place for that to happen some of you women and some of you husbands who've gone through childbearing years might remember contractions for those of you that don't know Brax and Hicks contractions are usually called false labor because they aren't really evidence that the woman's about to give birth and so they call it labor Jesus called the signs that he prophesied the beginning of birth beginning not the delivery but the beginning although people call Brax and contractions false labor let me just say that yes and no why no because it only happens to pregnant women usually in their third trimester in other words it's not the moment for delivery but it happens to a woman who's pretty soon going to give birth and when we see signs going on in our world that aren't the sign but they're evidence of a future it's a preview we have every reason to look up get ready because he's coming amen let's hallelu Our God hallelujah our god rign forever all my days hallelu oh God god hallelujah our god rign forever all my days hallelujah Lord my PR forever all my days hallelu since it's not your habit I don't expect you to remember but let me encourage you to remember I I don't know about you I'm working on my memory lately I I shared this Wednesday night I am I'm you know getting to a place where I'm noticing things and worse other people are noticing things that I'm not noticing so I did a little research on the best thing to take to help your memory I can't remember the name of it but it's true uh my other problem is I don't remember to take it now but anyway I I'm working on and I know it's not going to be something you're going to naturally remember to listen to Revelation chapter one it only take three minutes you can do it on your way home you do it when you get home do it before I don't really care when you do it but I want to encourage you to do it I want to ask you to believe God for the promise that he's promising you you don't have to listen to mine you can have somebody else read to but do it", "let's test god with his word say God bless me then show me something help me to think about it differently or respond to it differently in a way that honors you I think it's a good challenge so that's partially the reason I'm going to do it I'm going to listen to the whole book of Revelation not all at once but I'm going to listen to it and if it helps you I'll be more than happy to help you continue in that blessing God", "day we can rejoice and be glad in it so Lord thanks

Pastor Bob calls it the next step because we really do see it as the next step for those of you come here Sunday mornings to grow in your fellowship here but also with the Lord we're currently studying the Old Testament we have worship Bible study as well and we even serve dinner at 5 30 in our Courtyard so Senior Pastor Bob company thank you Josh I do want to encourage you to uh well first of all if you have not been baptized certainly to be water baptized and if you came forward to receive Christ or recommit your life but you've never been baptized in water you don't need to wait for a certain amount of time they didn't wait on the day of Pentecost the people that came to Faith got baptized that day and Jesus said remember if you'll confess me before men uh I'll confess you before my father we sometimes use that during altar calls to say you need to take a stand for the Lord but the primary biblical way you confess the Lord before men was publicly by being baptized in baptism you're symbolizing that what Jesus did on the cross he did for you you're identifying with him he died and was buried and rose again the third day so it's a picture of baptism it's actually Christ's work applied to you and so if you have come to faith in the Lord you're saying Jesus died for me he was buried for me and he came back to life and now because of that now Romans 6 I too want to die to my old life and I want to be alive in Christ so that's what you're symbolizing but one other thing I'll say to those of you that are not being baptized today but are part of this church body you need to realize that baptism is not just this independent individual personal thing between somebody in the Lord if but it's also an expression according to the scriptures of listen to me now being added to the body of Christ you say what do you mean well let me read it to you this is from First Corinthians 12. here's what Paul said for even as the body of Christ or the body of physical body is one and yet has many members all the members of the body though they are many are one body so also is Christ listen to this for by one Spirit we were all baptized into one body whether Jews or Greeks slaves are free and we were", "all made to drink of one Spirit meaning this the Holy Spirit the moment we get saved puts us into the body of Christ spiritually baptism besides being a picture of death and Resurrection is actually a picture of you the day that God added you to his body so that's why it's important that the body of Christ shows up to a baptism it's not just a lot I'm not getting baptized I don't know anybody yeah but we need that hand that foot we need the body gathered to become part of the body of Christ so that's why we want you to come to celebrate to support to enfold and just have a good time worshiping the Lord as we recognize God's work Among Us so please if you can one o'clock go out and get something quick if you need to grab something to eat because you're dying for food and come back at one and probably be an hour or so although we do have almost 90 people that signed up so that's awesome but stay as long as you can and celebrate with us first John chapter 2 is where I'd like you to open your Bibles today first John 2 beginning in verse 3. I'll give you a second to get there because I was ahead of yourself first John 2 verse 3 here's what John by this we know we have come to know him we keep his Commandments the one that says I've come to know him and does not keep his Commandments he's and the truth is not in him but whoever keeps his word in him the love of God has truly been perfected and by this we know that we are in him the one who says he abides in Christ ought himself to walk in the same manner as he walked father would you come and by your spirit engage us Lord we are your disciples we're here to be taught not by Bob company but by Jesus Christ through your word Lord that you gave to John so help me to be a good and faithful servant to share the truth of this but would you do by your spirit what you alone can do thank you that every believer has an anointing according to this very book that we're reading of their life so they don't need a man to teach them need the spirit of God to continue that work so we ask that you would do it this morning in Jesus name amen you can be seated when you received Christ which you know we emphasize at this", "church because in John 1 12 and 13 the Bible says to as many as received him he gave the right to become children of God lest there's someone here who's never heard that before and you believe in Jesus but you've never received him those don't you can't separate those two if you believe in him biblically to Salvation you have received him and so my challenge to you is to make sure you have but if you have received Christ and many of you have the Bible teaches us very clearly that he thou lives in us and the Bible also says that our life is in Christ so he's in us and we are in him in fact the the words in Christ or in him are used 180 times in the New Testament jot down if you would Second Corinthians 10 verses 5 and 6. listen to what Paul says to a carnal church he says test yourselves to see if you're in the faith hey examine yourselves or do you not literally know this about yourselves that Jesus Christ is in you unless indeed you failed the test but I trust that you will realize that we ourselves do not fail the test in other words Paul says there's a way you can find out and determine objectively whether Christ is alive in your life how do you know that you're saved are you sure that you're saved and another verse that's very important particularly in first John though we don't have it for you on the screen but you can jot it down it's first John 5 and verse 13. this is why John says he wrote the book it's always good to know what the author why he's writing he says these things I have written to you who believe in the name of the son of God listen to me that you may know and the word oida there means to have an to be cognizant of that you may know that you have eternal life so when people say well I'm not really sure if I die I'm going to go to heaven I kind of hope so no no no the Bible says make your calling in your election sure you can know that you're saved by the way there is a subjective awareness in Romans 8 the Bible says God's spirit Bears witness with our spirit that we're children of God there should be an internal witness but there are also objective evidences that were really saved and that's why I've called my message Blessed Assurance do you know that you really are saved have you taken", "the test and what are the evidences and John's talking to us all through this book about that so put this down we obey his commands if you're taking notes we obey God's commands when we know him put in the word no and intimately and again verse 3 by this we know that we have come to know him if we keep his Commandments Thomas Brooks uh Puritan writer said this assurance is a pearl that most want but a crown that few wear Assurance is a believer's Ark where he sits no alike quiet and still in the midst of all distractions and destructions commotions and confusions and I think of that great hymn many of us have some growing up Blessed assurance Jesus is mine oh what a foretaste of Glory Divine I pray you have that you are assured that you're saved but it's possible you're here and your Assurance rests on the wrong thing that is an unfortunate thing people are sure they're saved but their basis is completely not biblical so we want to talk from scripture what does Scripture say about how I can know that I'm saved you say well I prayed this prayer back don't don't put your Assurance on the fact that you pray to pray well I've been going to church my whole life and hanging out with people I've been in Ministry Judas could have claimed all that stuff be careful what you're claiming I believe in God the demons do too that's not the that's not your basis okay there's a lot of wrong things to claim an assurance of Salvation on we want to go to the scriptures to know that what our claim is rests on God's word put this down profession does not profession that is a claim does not necessarily mean that it's so in verse 4 the one who says and by the way this is something John's going to repeatedly talk about he uses this phrase the one who says in verse 4 in verse 6 the one who says and in verse 9 the one who says in other words that a lot of people that that doesn't mean it's necessarily true in verse 4 the one who says I've come to and does not keep his Commandments he is a liar we have that expression talk is there's an old expression fine words butter no parsnips I have no idea what that means so forget it's an old saying he who gives Fair words feeds you with an empty spoon most of us can figure out that one in other words if you're saying you know him and", "it's not backed up by obedience in your life God's fact Checker says you get because it's not true I don't care that you say it and think it's true it's not true objectively because you're not living in obedience now let's be clear the Bible is not saying if you aren't living sinless Perfection you're not saved that Bible doesn't teach that first John 1 says if you say you don't lie you don't sin you're a liar so we know it's not talking about we never sin again that's not what it's talking about but if if you're claiming to know the Lord but you don't obey his commands as a regular part of your life you don't even care to you don't even want to you have secret sin in your life that you're going to protect that's a dangerous thing and it may be evidence that you don't even really know the Lord knowing god according to this scripture is proven by our works please understand we're not saying salvation is based on Works no we're saved by grace through faith not of works but if we are actually saved by grace through faith it will create works the Bible says in Ephesians we as Believers are created in Christ Jesus unto good works that's Ephesians 2 10. that we might walk and God has works for us to do and there is an evidence that we're saved that's what James is talking about a lot of people get mixed up when they read the book of James and they say well the Bible says we're saved by faith and works it says that Abraham was justified by works this trips up a lot of Christians well I guess we it's not just by faith no don't misunderstand what James is saying we are saved by faith that's the only way anyone's ever saved by grace through faith any Abraham is the point that Paul points out in the Book of Romans he believed God he hadn't done anything and it was reckoned unto him as righteousness remember what James is talking about is the faith that saves is verified validated justified by works okay in other words it's proof that you got the real deal the right kind of faith is that it actually changes the way that you live not just the things that you believe many people claim to know Jesus as their lord like the text says if you say and there are plenty of people who say that but remember what Jesus says in the Book of Matthew when he returns he'll separate the Nations as a Shepherd", "separates the sheep and the goats remember the Sheep are going in the goats aren't going they think they're going and they call Jesus Lord now that's an amazing thing he said many will say to me on that day Lord Lord did we not do many miracles in your name prophesy in your name cast out demons we were involved in Ministry and by the way their theology seems to be very very orthodox remember what Paul says in the Book of Romans no one can say Jesus is Lord except by the power of the Holy Spirit now what does he mean a non-Christian can't say those words Jesus is Lord no of course they can say it it's just not it's not true so the Bible then says in Romans that if we'll confess with our mouth Jesus as Lord and believe in our heart God raise them from the dead will be saved it's a necessary part of Salvation that I recognize Jesus is the Lord God and he is my Lord and I've surrendered my life but many on the day of judgment will call them Lord but you remember what he'll say to them depart from me you workers of iniquity I never knew you you claim to know me you think you know me you know a lot about me what a huge difference there is in knowing a lot about somebody and knowing them when I was in fifth or sixth grade I had to do a book report and uh which means I had to plagiarize that's my research at sixth grade but anyway uh on someone famous I chose to do mine on Richard Milhouse Nixon because I lived here in Yorba Linda and he was the most famous person that had come from Yorba Linda this is pretty for Watergate and uh he's still the most famous person came from Yorba Linda for lots of reasons but anyway uh I uh I had visited Nixon's birthplace and uh listen is wasn't what it is now and I had done the research on him he was running for president at the time he hadn't been elected president yet and um I had studied where he practiced law in Whittier and various things about his life who he married and his his time in politics and so I'd written a lot about him but then I heard he was coming to town and actually he was up by Yorba Linda and Valley uh Valley View area Richfield Road right in there that was a big field back then this is before the Tasty Freeze in the car wash and all", "that and so he was coming to town so I had to go I had to go and huge crowds of people Secret Service and he's a candidate running for and so he's meeting people you know saying hi and kissing babies or whatever they do and I'm just a little boy but I remember I stuck my hands through the crowd I couldn't even see him I just stuck my hand just in case because he was walking down and I felt his hand I came home and said Mom I met I met Nixon you know I mean that's but I don't think he that day told his wife Pat guess who I met today Bobby company it was amazing um wasn't quite the same experience for him as it was for me but I kind of felt like I knew him you know I met him I read a lot about him I did not know him see you can deceive yourself because you've come to church read the stories and loved Jesus what's not to love about Jesus that you know him because you admire him because you respect him and because you say he's God that is not what this scripture is talking about just claiming to know him is not the same as knowing him personally so we need to understand what does it mean to know him but first jot down John 17 and verse 3. this underscores why this is so important Jesus said this in John 17 3. this is eternal life now whatever he's going to say after that we should be listening because that's pretty important here it is this is it this is eternal life that they may Know Thee speaking of the Father the only true God and he speaks to of himself and Jesus Christ whom thou whatever that is it's that important it affects whether or not someone has eternal life and I often like to talk to people who claim to be Christians to ask them do they know the lord it's not just talking about knowing something intellectually or knowing things about somebody it's talking about knowing them by the way when they translated the Old Testament written in Hebrew into Greek that's called the Septuagint as of the 70 people in Alexandria who translated it when they translated the Old Testament into Greek which was by the way the Bible during the time of Christ they weren't the people that studied the Bible then the coin a Greek was spread around the world by this because of Alexander the Great so it's interesting the translation of the Book of Genesis", "what it says it says that Adam knew his wife Eve he said well I hope so of course he got to North no no Adam knew his wife Eve and she bore a son oh that kind of known it's the same usage in the New Testament in Matthew when it says that Joseph and this is the new American Standard now for those of you that don't know I I use The New American Standard Bible because of its commitment to the original languages and its consistency and in the American Standard it says of Joseph that he kept his wife a virgin until after Jesus was born can I tell you something while I love this particular translation that's a terrible translation in that particular case the word virgin is not there in the Greek at all it doesn't say technically the G that Joseph kept his wife a virgin in the King James that does a much better job he was not knowing his wife that's what it says you say Bob what's your point that this word gonosco that is used in all of those places is talking about an intimate not an knowledge of the lord it's a relational knowledge and so if we know the Lord we will obey him put this down letter be we keep his word when we love him in verse 5 whoever it doesn't say here obeys his word although that's the same idea it actually is a little different little different Nuance whoever keeps his word it literally means keeps an eye on it watches over it it's a word they used for guarding someone whoever watches keeps an eye on God's word in him the love of God has truly been perfected and by this we know that we so put this down we keep his word because it's precious to us that's the idea we keep our eye on what he has said I have a pastor friend who texted out on a uh or a meme that he put out this last week he said uh this morning God texted was kind of caught my eye he said it was in second Kings chapter one and I thought that's exactly a good save you see we as a church send out emails to the whole body of Christ we get about 20 percent of you that even open them it's not great we've noticed even if sometimes you'll leave voicemails for people they don't even you know they don't even listen to them if you want to get someone's attention you text them in fact it's an interesting thing I just", "gotta someone texted me yesterday saying Pastor Bob I need to talk to you and they shared kind of what was going on so I had a minute so I called them and they answered and they hung up on me they said they texted me they said you called me by mistake I said well he has to talk to me they didn't mean talk they I guess I'm just too old to know that I'd be old school I thought talking I like what that Pastor said God texted me this morning can I tell you something when you develop a relationship with the Lord and you start reading his word it becomes precious to you it's like hey God texted me this morning he has something to say to me it's not just the Bible that was written for the world he's actually speaking to me personally that's what the Lord wants in relationship to you his word becomes precious because he's precious to you put this down make loving Christ your only motive for obeying him make loving him your only motive for obeying him jot down John 14 and verse 15. Jesus said this if you love me you will keep my Commandments if you love me you will keep my Commandments it's been said there are three motivations for obedience one motivation that sometimes people have is they need to obey they need to obey if they don't there's going to be consequences a slave has to obey otherwise they're in big trouble an employee chooses to obey because of the rewards that are attached you do the things your boss says you stay you do whether you like it or not you're doing it but it's not because you love your job or because you love your boss you're doing it because you want something from that obedience but then there's an obedience that flows out of love and a Christian is to obey out of love a baby Christian often obeys God's word because of either warnings God says if I don't do this there's a bad consequence and I don't want that or if I do this I'll get this I remember as a young Christian hearing that scripture in Psalm 37 delight yourself from the Lord he will give you what desires of your heart I think that's the only part of the verse that I read desires of my heart what do I got to do I gotta Delight in him okay I love you and I want my stuff I you know let's face it I I I'll do what you said", "because I uh that's really what it's but the person who loves the Lord starts choosing to obey God because they want to please him Paul says we have our ambition to be pleasing to the Lord you know uh it's David in the Old Testament who says this in the Psalms oh how I love thy law now a lot of Christians read that I was like really I don't like the law at all I'm glad the law is over I'm glad Jesus you know don't have to worry about the law and it's very hard for sometimes people to understand why would he say that's because I don't think a lot of Christians really understand the nature of the law in terms of it being a reflection of God's will um I once saw a cartoon it was of Moses coming down from Mount Sinai with the Ten Commandments in his hand to the children of Israel who were waiting and he the the person who wrote made a little cartoon has Moses say well I had him throw in the milk and honey but the abort the adultery Clause stays like he had been negotiating with God and this is the deal that I got see what people don't understand is that when God gave the law at Mount Sinai the Bible considers that God considers it a marriage covenant did you know that that's when Israel became and these were vows that were being given if you think about it like that you start to realize marriage vows are what we might call rules for a relationship to protect a relationship in fact if you want to read it you can read it's in Exodus 19. God says here's what you are to do and you know what the people of Israel said we do we accept it we'll do it now they didn't do it but they said they wanted to it was see when my when my wife stood before the minister with me and he said to her now Becky Olson that was her old name do you promise to forsake all others and keep yourself Only onto Bob as long as you both shall live she didn't say all others could I commit the most no she happily said yes no problem I've been waiting for this day I Delight I accept those rules 100 he's gonna do it too right yep I'm B2 if you understand that it's a covenant relationship those are not hard to at all listen the giving of the law was a wedding it was not a shotgun wedding God didn't", "force anybody to do anything they wanted to that's why David said oh how I love thy law you need to understand here the idea is if I love the Lord I am looking to please him and by the way I'm not just looking to do the bare minimum of what God says I want to please God remember in the Old Testament there's a time when David is on the run from Saul and the Philistines are the enemy the Philistines are camped out in David's Home city of Bethlehem David is in a cave it's hot and he is not asking anybody to do anything he just mentions the fact that he remembers growing up that was his hometown Bethlehem the water of Bethlehem man that would be so nice to have some of that water that'd be great and there are three men three of David's Mighty Men Who overhear David musing about the water of Bethlehem we're not told exactly how it happens we're just told that without David knowing I just picture it like this these guys go you want to go let's do it let's go come on let's go on their own without being told they choose to go to Bethlehem break through the ranks of the Philistines they're fighting for their lives these crazy three guys with an army to get to a well to get a scoop of water I'm sure the Philistines are going what's with these guys it's all about that water and then they they leave and they they get out alive I don't know if they got injured but they'd come from the battle and they find David and they said hey David remember what you said about the water this is it we just got it for you and David is blown away he didn't send anybody to go get it these guys loved him because he had David was their and they just wanted to please him you know what the Bible says David was so impressed with what they brought him do you know what he did he didn't drink it he poured it out on the ground I've often said if I was one of those Mighty Men I might have gone hey you drink that now I don't know they didn't say that but you know why he did that it was he felt like to drink that water would be like taking their life blood because of what it cost them to give it to him so he poured it out before the Lord as a gift holy this is Holy to God in other words", "you guys I didn't tell you to do anything you just want to please me that's what love does for the Lord it says God I don't want to just do the bare minimum of what you're saying so I can go to heaven I want to please you I want to bless you so it is that love becomes the primary motivation of how we're to please God jot down first John 5 and verse 3. John will say this later in the book for this is the love of God that we keep his Commandments and his Commandments are not burdensome what did Jesus say take my yoke upon you and learn of me for my yoke is easy and my load is light the second of the last book in your Bible is the book of Jude it is only one chapter I sometimes call it a postcard of an epistle it's short but in that little book Jude talks about the Old Testament and he talks about men who fell away and led other people into sin as well as Angels who rebelled against God but he talks about the sin of Sodom he talks about the error of Balaam in the Book of Numbers he talks about the way of Cain and he talks about the rebellion of Korah which we just studied on Wednesday night just here recently in the Book of Numbers these different times in the Old Testament were God's people fell away into sin and the people of the world fell away into sin as though to say you know there's lots of different ways to sin against the Lord The Temptations that you're facing are not the exact temptations that the person next to you are facing we can fall away in all kinds of different ways I think the subtitle of the book of Jude should be there must be 50 Ways to Leave Charles Wesley called him the lover of in his great hymn there's lots of ways to fall away from the Lord but that's not Jude's primary point there are lots of ways that people have and do and will fall away from God the point of Jude is what he says in he says keep yourself in the love of God in other words there's only one way for all of us to keep from falling away and that's to stay in love with the Lord that's why John will say in first John 2 15 and 16. we'll get there just not do not love the world or the things in the world for all that", "is in the world the lust of the Flesh and the lust of the eyes and the pride of life is not from the father you see when we are drawn into the things of this world it's because there's an inadequacy in our love with God and so Jesus says if you love me you will keep my commands put this down let her see his life as he lives through us personally put in the word lives and personally look at verse six the one who says again we got a claim he abides in Christ I abide in the lord well then you ought yourself to walk or live in the same manner as he walked now we are all impressed with the life we're not always all that excited about having to try to live that way remember the mother that was trying to teach her little boys a lesson she made and each one of them wanted the first and she said should I teach there's a moment to teach you know so she said to them she said well you know you got to do what Jesus would do older boy said to his brother you be yeah we all agree that what Jesus did is wonderful but it is also sacrificial we don't necessarily always prefer to do it put this down Christ's example is for those already saved why do I say that because it's not just about trying to make your life resemble I find that unsaved people respect the life of Jesus Gandhi respected the teachings of Jesus our politicians always point to the sermon on the mountain the ethical teachings of Jesus what are who who can find fault with him well nobody could find fault with him there was no fault in him this Wednesday night I'll be talking about the red heifer which is a type of Christ it's very interesting without blemish could have no blemish no defect you see Jesus didn't have any they couldn't find any they had people lie to try to accuse him a child there wasn't anything even pilate couldn't find anything wrong with him he tried nothing there but his example cannot be followed by us simply by our own efforts we won't be successful no his example is for those who are already saved the one who says he abides it and well one of the evidences will be you walk you live you act the same way that he does remember this an example including Christ's example doesn't save anybody we're not saved by his example I mean you think about it you got a", "swimming pool and someone's drowning the Lifeguard doesn't say hey hey hey to the drowning person just try this no you got to jump in and save the person it's not the example that has power to save we find this expression again and again in the New Testament given to Believers even as Christ do this even as Christ somebody offends you somebody hurts you what are you supposed to do you're supposed to forgive even as Christ and by the way let me add just an element that you already know is true Jesus when it came to forgiving was willing to forgive ready to forgive people who weren't asking for it and he always took the initiative oh thanks for sharing that Pastor see because I've got uh you know maybe it's a husband and wife thing you know she disrespected me he's not thinking about me he offended me and I'll forgive him if they ask for it really mean it and for 20 years prove that they're not a narcissist whatever I mean we have all these conditions we put on I hate the word narcissist listen to me people are loving that word in just about everything I'm reading today I just call center sinners let me go on since I shouldn't get off on a topic that we're not teaching on even as Christ jot down Ephesians 4 and be kind to one another tenderhearted forgiving each other just as God in Christ also has forgiven you which is every time you've asked for it he's ready to forgive you and by the way biblically he's the one who took the initiative you want to forgive no you said I don't really want to forgive like that preacher move on you've gone from preaching to meddling you know there's an old saying that biblical preaching ought to comfort The Afflicted and afflict the comfortable and sometimes we reach I was like oh I'm supposed to forgive like that yeah yeah that's what the Lord wants us to do he wants us to act like he acted and the way he acts husbands love your wives as Christ loved the church gave himself up for her gave up his will for her said father I don't want to go to the Cross how could I possibly want to be separated from you I've only known intimacy with you for all eternity I've never known sin in the separation and death that it brings of course I don't want that but nevertheless not my will be done but yours why for the Joyce up before me for my bride to be able to go", "to heaven it's got to be you see and so Christ becomes our example in every way how to live this life John will tell us that Jesus gave us an example on the night he was going to be betrayed he knew he was going to be betrayed it wasn't like a shock it was a shock to the disciples wasn't a shock to Jesus how do we know because he tells Judas uh it's go do it's time to leave the supper and go betray me Jesus is not surprised tonight it's going to happen the shepherd will be smitten the Sheep will be scattered Jesus knew what was going down and that would put a little pressure on me it's like yeah it's gonna really this horrible thing's about to happen see when horrible things are about to happen and I know it I don't go Man I Feel Like Loving well I think like like to serve somebody today I don't think like that I I mean if I get just a little cold I want to be babied in bed yeah it's a bad cold it could turn into something that would kill me probably should make me dinner and you know I'm just a baby Jesus has greater stress than any of us have ever had and he's thinking about on the cross go go read the seven words of the Cross how much of that was ministering to other people is he's dying for us not enough that you're dying for my sin I want you to also worry about Mary and John and their future and the guy who's definitely a bit of creep and he's going to hell unless he gets saved and now he wants to be saved you have time to witness to him and oh yeah Jesus is ministering constantly and John records in John 13 that Jesus that night wash his feet and then Jesus says to everybody do you know what I've done I've given you an example that if I as your master wash your feet if I can do that Peter tells us in First Peter 2 that when Christ was accused of all kinds of things that weren't true when he was mocked he didn't say anything he kept silent so Jesus is our example when he suffered and Jesus is our example when he served in both ways the way he handled it is the way I'm supposed to have him I don't just go wow that's amazing I could never do no the one who says he abides in him ought to walk in the same manner", "as he walked so abiding put this down is key to being a Channel of his character a Channel of his character now when we read that sometimes like well I'm really glad Jesus is that way but that's not that's not possible for me to be that I can't do that I'm not God I'm not a wonder worker I'm not a water I'm not a water into whiner those are things that Jesus alone can do but we are told in the scriptures how this happens what's the mechanism that I could possibly act like Jesus jot it down John 15 verses 4 and 5. Jesus said abide in me and I in you as the branch cannot bear fruit of itself unless it abides in the vine so neither can you unless you abide in me I'm the vine you're the branches he who abides in me and I in him he Bears much fruit for apart from me you can do what is the significance of the branch abiding in the Vine see sometimes you come to church oh man I miss the Lord I'm going to sing I'm gonna hear the Bible be around Christians I'm gonna get my spiritual batteries charged up I need it because I'm gonna after I leave church this guy's back to the real world that's hard I gotta go back to Wednesday I ain't get charged up again I know that feeling that is not the basis of bearing fruit getting recharged from time to time the idea is of a constant connection try to do that with your fruit tree take I don't care what fruit it's supposed to be producing try to occasionally attach it and see how much fruit you get uh don't actually you separate the branch from the tree you get squat ever continue you need to abide long enough for the fruit to come through you the branch doesn't get recharged it dies if it gets disconnected so if we're gonna act like Christ acted it's a different kind of a relationship than just being encouraged and learning it's talking about a life relationship the life is pouring through that Branch continuously and over time developing the very fruit of the tree so it's not really imitation think about it Paul put it this way in Galatians 2 I was reading yesterday in John 6 where Jesus gave a sermon that people did not like now I know I've got everything else Jesus said it's like that's amazing that's wonderful this one you go I don't he said unless you eat my flesh and drink my blood you have no pardon me", "he says your father's in the wilderness Moses didn't give them the living bread he the bread from Heaven the Manna was not living bread it was just bread it was it was man it was Supernatural but it just came kept them physically alive they all died you know food it nourished them for a but he said I am the true Bread of Heaven I am listen to me I am the living bread that was dead bread it was bread it was just physical bread I am the living bread you see when you eat a piece of bread it goes in and it becomes a part of you oh not just your blood and your digestive tract you can go read about those nutrients go through every cell of your entire body becomes part of you Christ is saying if you believe in me you have to receive me and allow my life because I'm alive I'm not dead bread I'm a living bread I need to affect every part of who you are of your soul of your character I want to live in you and I want to bring my life to live through you now that only happens with abiding you I'm not super great at golfing I'm the first to admit it you don't have to tell me I already know but there have been some times I have actually played amazing not to toot my own horn bye there was a time at one one particular day I'll never forget it I actually got two holes in one uh on an 18 hole course and I've never done that since but I was a pretty everybody was amazed that day um even the guy in the counter when I turned the the club back in and the balls he was amazed that you know because one of them was the windmill one yep that's true I tell people my gift in golfing is to help other people feel good about their I'm really good at that my game seems to be going worse and worse over the years I you can ask my sons or something in my brain when I putt I just did this thing where I know exactly I'm supposed to putt but I go it's like holds right here Dad is like and then my drives are off and my short game and the chip shots pretty pretty much the whole game okay but what if what if we can just imagine for a moment Jack Nicholas by the way he's 88 seemed to be the greatest golfer of all time", "even better than tiger in terms of the awards he's won still plays by the way but what if we could take the skill of Jack Nicholas spirit and mind of Jack Nicholas and and the skill of Tiger Woods Jack Woods could somehow get in my body and play golf I'd beat you I'd be I don't care I'd I'd be my I'd be amazing here's the good news Jesus Christ wants to live his life in and through you when he does he is going to reveal to you and give you an assurance that he is in you because you're going to have desires that are not from you you're going to have abilities that are not from you and the fruit that is produced by the way never forget this the tree that produces fruit never eats the fruit see we often read Galatians 5 22 and 23 oh I want the fruit of spirit I want to be more loving I want to be joyful that's all fruit that's the character of Christ produced but the tree doesn't it's not that I don't enjoy producing fruit but I fulfill my purpose in producing fruit that's the idea other people get to enjoy the fruit a treat never goes I'm hungry I'm an orange tree oh an orange ah tastes are great never never the Orange is for someone else to taste and see to discover what kind of tree is that Jesus said you'll know them by their fruits you and I are to have the Life of Christ pouring through us to fulfill our purpose to reveal what we really are but the life and the glory all it's the Lord's people see him you see that's what fruit is about by the way it's interesting the fruit has seed in go study what seed represents in the is the ability to produce the life of that very plan you see when people see Christ in you then they can come to know him because they tasted Christ through your life that's the idea come we're going to spend a little time in worship but let me share this true story before we close tonight or this this afternoon a missionary in central China was reading to A group about Jesus healing the blind and the sick these are people who had never heard the gospel suddenly with smiling faces this crowd shout out oh we know him he used to live here no no you're mistaken they go no no we'll show you his grave they said when the Great Plague came he would not leave us he gave us things out", "of a bottle that made us well we had babies that were blind he washed their eyes and he made them see oh we know him very well he often walked down our streets the missionary said that cannot be he lived in a land far from here hundreds of years ago but they showed him a grave and on inquiry the missionary found that it was of a young Christian Missionary Doctor Who had gone 600 miles up the Yangtze River to their little town he had lived among them after such a manner that when they heard the story of Jesus they cried out we he lived here wouldn't it be great if when people hear about the character of Jesus they couldn't help but thinking about you and so I I've seen that character I've seen that kind of forgiveness I've seen that kind of selflessness you see the Bible says we are to be a fragrance of Christ that Christ is wanting us to be his life lived out on this Earth we are his Temple we are his he's our head but he's in heaven and he's using us to express his life in this world if people are going to get to know Jesus it's going to be because of you not just because they hear a gospel message it's going to be you that's what he wants to do so Blessed Assurance do I know him well do I obey him again not perfectly but I'm not willing to live unconfessed sin in my life I'm not wanting to protect us and I hate the sin of myself what did Paul say oh Wretched Man that I am who will free me from this body of sin and death I don't want to live that way anymore do you have that attitude to your sinners like well I can keep that a secret I'm more spiritual than some Christians I know I I asked Jesus into my life so I'm going to heaven oh beware that you're not you say I want to obey the Lord more then fall deeper in love with him like that old song says Turn Your Eyes Upon Jesus look full in his wonderful face things of this Earth man you got to be joking well that's not part of the song I just threw that in they'll grow dim in the light of his glory and grace just fall deeper in love with the Lord Jesus you'll find desires to do things for him you know when I dated Becky I did things that I I don't do as much as I should", "because I wanted to impress her she thought she was dating a

you to uh take a moment to sign that some of you don't know this but a member from our fellowship here ran for orange City born School Board because they wanted to make a difference uh in this particular area and first time getting involved in any kind of politics and was a very close election and in part counted their ability they only won by I don't know how many votes but they knew that the support from folks in this church helped them to get elected and they're making a difference and they're a voice uh in the school board but this petition is an opportunity not to be or have kids in this you don't live in Orange to say I care about this issue and I want to go on record and I think it's one of the easiest best ways to be Salt and Light right now in our community so please don't miss an opportunity to sign that petition if you want to understand more what you're signing please go out and figure that out but you're saying some things about some things that are inappropriate in our minds and I think in yours that shouldn't be in the curriculum so check that out before you go home hey I'd like you to open your Bibles now to First John chapter two as we continue our study of this epistle first John chapter 2 the first two verses today and if you're watching online hello it's good to see you I can't see you like good to be seen by you I hope you can see us first John 2 first two verses my little children I'm writing these things to you so that you may not sin and if anyone sins we have an advocate with the father Jesus Christ the righteous and he himself is the propitiation for our sins not for ours", "only but also for those of the whole world father what incredible blessing we have because we're children of God you have loved us and Lord eternity is going to be in part understanding magnifying and appreciating what you've done but I thank you that you give us a season on Earth of studying your word discovering those things that are already ours Lord sometimes we're struggling in our life because we don't really know the inheritance we already have in Christ so would you give us eyes to see the resources we have in our battle against sin today Lord that we might have Victory and might have confidence of your forgiveness in Jesus name I pray amen you can be seated you know if you go into just about any bookstore as long as they're still bookstores I know those are probably going the way of the world with the internet but um there's always going to be in a bookstore a a section of self-help or how to and uh there's a whole series you've probably seen them uh how-to for dummies I'm really glad someone felt you know compelled to create those my only problem is when I read one of those and I still don't get it that's a little embarrassing you know somebody needs a whole another series for people that don't quite get it but I've never seen maybe there is one I've never seen a book that simply says that it's about this how to deal with sin or how to fix sin but actually that could be the subtitle on your Bible in fact I wrote that on a little notepad I slapped it on my Bible yesterday because I want to remember that's in part what your Bible is designed to help you to do and John's going to talk to us about that today that's why it's the title of my message how to deal with sin and the first thing we've talked about this in chapter one you got to admit you got it Jesus will forgive you but you need to admit you have sin and you're dealing with sin even after you're forgiven so he says to the woman in John 8 go and sin no more I don't condemn you but you gotta deal with this he tells the woman in John 4 go call your husband she says I don't have one he says that's right you've had five and the guy you have right now not your husband oh boy you must be a prophet you know some stuff about me that I wouldn't have told you", "yes I know everything about you and I still love you and so the Lord is not trying to whitewash the fact that we have committed sins that need to be forgiven and that we have sin in our life that needs to be overcome he wants to help us and the scriptures are going to talk to us today about those two subjects how do I overcome it and how do I know that I am truly forgiven so put this down God's word is God's provision for sins Devastation put in the word word and Devastation now he's just been talking to us about pretending we don't if we say that we do not sin we lie if we say we've never sinned we're making gone alive we talked about this this deception of I don't have that problem I'm not really a sinner we don't understand you know some of us well we don't some of us don't even know the name but have a Norman Greenbaum theology you'd have to be from my generation to even know what that is because he wrote a song about uh uh it was called Spirit of the sky how many of you remember song Spirit in the Sky in that song He said uh I never sinned I've got a friend in Jesus so I know that when I die he's going to recommend me to the spirit of the sky Jesus is so cool and I don't see that that perception of yourself that you don't Sid is the first problem you don't even know that you're you do commit sin and you need to be forgiven all sin is the word Almighty and the Greek means to miss the mark the Bible says for all have sinned and fallen short of the glory of God we do not live perfect life sinless lives only one person did it was Jesus Remember Jesus would ask his enemies the question which of you convicts me or accuses me now I would never ask my best friends that question I wouldn't ask the people that loved me the most frankly they'd be in line because they know more about me than anybody's but Jesus could ask his enemies that question because the only sins they could accuse him of were trumped up charges at his trial remember they tried to get the witnesses to agree they couldn't get him to agree or they misunderstood he said he's going to destroy the temple and I'll raise it no he didn't say that he was talking about his body not to tell in other words they were all false accusations against him", "but Jesus never sinned but everyone in this room including you and mwah we do even though we're still we're Christians we still have to deal with sin and one of the provisions God has given to us is his word now you know um when he says these words I am writing these things to you so that you may not sin our temptation is studying oh my first of all you just said we're all going to sin so what do you mean you're writing things so we don't sin which is it I'm gonna sin or I don't have to sin you first of all do sin and are going to sin so long as you are in this human body but if you're a Christian never use that as an excuse to sin well you know I'm just a sinner and the Bible says I'm going to sin so I'm I'm sitting a little bit here because that's what I do no no listen here's how I'll put it stop confusing your propensity to sin with the necessity to sin they're not the same we like to talk about and rightly we should and we will today about the work of Christ on the cross and his resurrection that allows us to live without condemnation means this I don't have to fear the penalty of sin which is to be condemned by God okay we emphasize that and we need to but there's another aspect of the work of the Cross it's not just the penalty of sin has been taken care of by Christ but listen to me the power of sin in my life not just the damnation of sin but the domination of sin and this is what John is referring to yes you'd be lying if you say you don't sin and you don't have a problem with it but don't use that as an excuse to go and sin I'm writing these things to you that you may not sin if you want to study more about this you need to camp out in Romans 6 for a while because that's where Paul talks about this Doctrine Romans 6 6 reckon this that the old man is dead that we are should no longer be slaves to sin we were before we were saved but we're not now if you're a slave to sin that's not why Jesus saved you to be enslaved to sin and you're a slave of the one you present yourself to either of sin resulting in death or of righteousness which will bring glory to God you're making a decision don't let sin reign in", "your mortal body you can only give that command to a Christian and so it's important to realize that when the Lord says you don't have to sin you say well but I think I still have to sin because I'm I'm a sinner be careful with that remember this Jesus said apart from me you can do squat that's in the in the Greek apart from me you can do nothing but Paul will say I can do all things not some things on occasionally something I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me so when a Christian says oh I can't be more honest and say I won't forgive them or at least I happened yet let's stop saying I can't I can't stop drinking I can't stop cussing I can't stop gossiping I can't stop lusting no you can stop lying about the fact that you're unable to stop you need to start there let me address the elephant in the see the elephant in the room yeah remember the story elephants born tied down with a little stake tries to pull the stake out of the ground because it wants to get away and it can't does that for a while does it a bunch of times until it finally comes to that conclusion there's no sense in pulling on that steak I can't get it out of the ground and little elephant becomes jumbo the giant circus elephant with enough power to pull up a tree but it's tied down with the little steak because it thinks it can't because it couldn't before that's a good picture of a lot of people who are Christians I've tried having victory over that sin and I tried and I tried and I I said I was sorry and I gave I I I just I'll go to heaven and then I'll be done with it you're a big part of the problem if you are accepting sin in your life because you haven't had Victory rather than believing that Christ died to give you the victory and say Lord I want to learn how I can have Victory here's what John will later say in his book I have written to you young man he's not talking about just young men he's talking about young men spiritually and he describes them this way he says I've written to you young men because you are because the word of God abides in you and because you have overcome the wicked one all three of those go together you want to have spiritual strength to overcome sin and the wicked one in your", "life the word of God abides in you those two things are related that's why the psalmist says Thy word have I hid in my heart that I might not sin against thee you see Jesus out in the wilderness to be tempted of the devil beginning of his ministry is tempted in all points as we are yet without sin the lust of the Flesh and the lust of the eyes and the boastful pride of life same sins same temptations that Eve underwent in the garden by the way and each time he is tempted what are the first words out of his mouth it is it is written man shall not live by bread alone for instance he answers every Temptation with the word of God it's important that we realize one of the deceptions that Satan has for us is that you can't even as a pre you'll never you've never had Victory what makes you think you'll ever have victory over that sin you might as well give up and maybe you have and maybe that's why you do not have Victory because you think I can't I grew up watching cartoons and in my day Popeye was one of those you remember Pop I don't know if he's still on but pop by the Sailor Man Of course Brutus this big galute was his enemy because olive oil somebody who was anorexic by the way uh was his girlfriend and uh anyway Popeye uh there was always a scene in every time where he was going to get into a fight and how to you know defend her honor or defend himself and he would eat what spinach I don't know why they chose that but they chose spinach but as soon as Popeye ate the spinach instantly he had these muscle he had muscles on muscles on muscles and he could he was like a superhero I was like oh man that's awesome it was an awesome I liked watching it until it was dinner time at and my mom she's in heaven so she forgives Me of anything I say negative and I loved her she was amazing cook but she would buy frozen vegetables including frozen spinach now frankly spinach is kind of yucky even if it's not miping but Frozen not sure I think that's cruel and unusual punishment actually but anyway she they would have spinach there and that was the one thing I saw the cartoons and stuff that was nice for Popeye not interested but they would remind me hey that will make you strong I'm not I'm fine you know", "I'm not planning to fight anybody today you know oh no it's full of really good stuff for you they told me it's full of iron I'd say that's why it tastes it tastes like it's full of something like by the way do you know in the 1930s this cartoon came out in 1929 when when it came out spinach became the Third a favorite uh vegetable favorite food of children in the United States for a while because of Popeye that's right they started they sold about a third more than they ever had before but anyway I bring that up not because it has anything to do with anything other than to say this I believe scripture is our spiritual spinach here's what Peter will say in First Peter 2 2 long for the pure milk of the word that by it you may grow with respect to Salvation faith comes by hearing and hearing the word of God why is that so important because that's how you resist the devil resist the devil firm in your faith you see you and I need to grow in our faith not just our knowledge of the Bible but our belief in the Bible because what we believe from the bible really demonstrates itself in how we behave so put this down it provides the Bible does and sin correction prevention detection preachers like to say concerning first John 1 9 that it's the Christian bar of soap first John 1 9 says if we confess our sins he's faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteous and now we just studied that it's true there's no sin that can't be cleansed if you're willing to confess and forsake it that's true right now the mistake comes though sometimes with saying that that's God's whole plan for dealing with sin in our life you just need to First John 1 9 it I've heard well let me give you a little illustration that you need to keep in your mind about this if you've been up to Big Bear Running Springs Arrowhead you've gone up those windy roads way you notice that the state of California has taken some of our tax money and invested it in warning signs slow down your speed soft shoulder they put up guard rails thankfully along some of those Cliffs or all of those Cliffs they put a lot of money and time and Engineering into that if you think about it we're I'm really glad they did that especially at night and then the fog which is horrible up", "but you know the state of California could have saved all that money and just built a hospital at the base of the and people who say the only way to deal with sin is to confess it they're saying that the only way to really get get it right no no no the Lord has some things to say about preventing sin that I think we need to spend some time on and so God's holy spirit through John says I'm writing these things to you so that you may not said you are going to sin but in any particular opportunity to sin as a Christian you don't have to that's the truth about you as a Believer you used to have to before you knew the Lord but now the spirit of God and the word of God can give you the capacity in any particular case to say no and to Victory and so you know I think of John Bunyan John Bunyan wrote the famous work Pilgrim's Progress he wrote it in prison but it was his father who gave him that Bible and in the fly leaf of his Bible wrote these words this book will keep you from sin or sin will keep you from that's exactly true and it's still true this book The Bible will keep you from sin where sin will keep you from this book remember the psalmist said Thy word have I hid in my heart not in my head it's not enough to get the word in my brains I need it in my veins spiritually for me to have victory over sin put this down Hebrews 4 and verse 12 we're given some insight about dealing with sin in terms of detecting it and correcting it from the writer to Hebrews he says this the word of God and active I've never liked the translation Act of it reminds me of a retirement home advertisement for active adults no the word active powerful is what it means alive and powerful and it's sharper God's word than any two-edged makira doesn't mean a long big battle sword speaks of a scalpel or a short sword and it's pierces the word of God does as far as the division of Soul and Spirit which is very hard to distinguish between it distinguishes between joints and marrows and it's able to judge or discern the thoughts and the intentions of the heart you've heard me say it I'll say it again in case you've never heard me say it or forgot I have read many I have one book that reads me so do you you have one book", "oh you may like some other books you may get insights from some other books they may be entertaining or lightning but God's word is different it's the only book you have that reads you it can understand you would you pray search me oh God and know my heart it's a good prayer from Psalm 139 . you need to also be in God's word because God's word alone uniquely can understand you can help you to see yourself you do self-surgery when you open the Bible and you say Lord I want to see what you have to say about me the word of God judges my thoughts my ideas my opinions my perspectives you know the Bible is a mirror according to the Book James says we're to be not just hearers of the word who delude themselves but we're to be doers of the word so if we come and listen to a message we do nothing with it but oh that was nice that was good I really like that I agree with I never knew that before but we don't do anything beyond that oh we're deluding ourselves there are Christians every Sunday who go to church the Bible say they think they're growing because but they're not changing at all oh don't deceive yourself what are you gonna do with it how's it going to change your life that needs to be your question in mind every time I open the Bible every time I hear a sermon God what am I going to do with this James says that the Bible is a mirror he said you know if you listen to the and you see something about yourself but you don't change you're like a person who gets up you know you got this morning probably most of you looked in the mirror I'm sure I'm sure all of you did now unless there's somebody here goes like I don't need to I'm like one dude I'm already good to go right out of bed oh really that's amazing most of us look at it in America where did you come from I didn't look that bad last night Sandman showed up you know whatever it is my hair is like all right I need some like the natural man who looks at his natural face in a mirror sees something that should be changed and says ah whatever and walks away and never does anything about how crazy would that be now the Bible does show us ourselves and here's the fact with the power of the holy spirit in our life God gives this", "the ability to see it the sin to hate the sin and to overcome that sin because I can do all things through him who strengthens me this is second Corinthians 3 18. it's not just information I get from God's word which that I need the transformation here's what Paul says but we all with unveiled phases unlike Moses on the mountain we behold as in a mirror the glory of the Lord and we're being transformed not just informed but transformed into the same image from glory to glory Justice from the Lord the spirit of God so God's word is the tool that the Holy Spirit uses in us to see and understand to prevent but to detect and correct sin then put this down know this loving the Bible isn't the same as living now it's true when people get saved when they get filled with the Holy Spirit one of the character I was going to say symptoms what are the characteristics of being full of the holy spirit is a love for the Lord and a love for his word how do I know that because the Bible teaches when you're filled with the spirit you'll be speaking to one another in the last time you talked to somebody in singing making melody in your heart to the Lord the word of God is going to have a new place in your life when you're filled with the Holy Spirit not just because you get saved but when you get filled with the spirit of God the word of God is going to become a treasure to you you're going to start realizing I love God you're going to start having a greater capacity for the word of God you'll start wanting to read it when you're not in church when no you know I want to be with the Lord I want to I want to hear from the lord it's an amazing thing the spirit of God gives us a capacity to have an appetite for the word of God and not just to learn it but to actually live it but loving the Bible isn't the same as living the Bible it was just this last week a man and a woman and we're in the news somewhere in the midwest I think they were at a home during that Bible study they were holding hands he even gave her a kiss at husband wife and at some point he leaned over said something to her she said no he proceeded to stab her to death been taken into custody you say what's that about I have no idea I don't", "here's a guy in a Bible study in an affectionate relationship with his wife I have no idea what that was about it's like that is so that doesn't make any I think of Judas Jesus says there in the garden do you betray me with a a kiss is phony you see I think sometimes we get the idea that people are around the Lord and his people that that Satan has no access see you got to remember it was at the Passover meal where Jesus was with his disciples that the Bible says and Satan entered into Judas there Jesus goes to synagogue where they're going to worship God and they're a demon possessed man is there don't don't get the idea that Satan doesn't have access to this building or that he's afraid of our gathering or he's afraid of the Bible Satan uses the word of God to try to tempt Jesus in the wilderness he's not afraid of your Bible he's afraid and he's going to have problems with you if you believe your Bible resist infirm in your faith how do I give I need to believe the word of God not because you know it see the danger of thinking because now I'm a Bible lover somehow that means that I'm living it well you can be super self-deceived in that remember what Jesus said to the Pharisees the Pharisees were the Bible Thumpers of their day they spend all their time reading the Bible now that's a commendable thing here he said he said this to him and John he said you search the scriptures now look that's not a bad thing isn't that exactly what Paul the Apostle said to commend the bereans who were more noble than those of thessalonica why because they daily were searching the scriptures to see if the things he was teaching were true it's good to search the scriptures is this right commendable be a Workman who doesn't need to be ashamed rightly dividing the word of Truth you got to get into the word know the word but he said you guys do that you search the scriptures listen to me now for in them in what in the scriptures you think you have eternal life but it is these the scriptures that bear witness of me interesting you've replaced me with your we do not worship the Bible that's called bibliology and evangelicals are the ones who are tempted and don't even realize it's happening the Trinity is not the father Son and Holy scriptures but you are unwilling to come to me that I might give you life Jesus said", "but this I testify of you you don't have the love of God in you remember what Jesus said if you love me you'll keep my Commandments well I want to obey the Lord I need to love the Lord not just love his word that's not enough I need to love the author of the word of God God's son must become my master God's love must become my motive for obedience God's spirit is the motor God's word is the method whereby I can see with my eyes spiritualize and deal with my own sin and experience Victory now put this down letter be God's son is God's provision from sin's condemnation so God's word is provision from the devastation of sin to prevent it and to deal with it after I've committed it but God's son is God's provision from sin's condemnation in the second part of verse one and if we have an advocate with the father Jesus Christ the righteous and verse 2 he himself is the propitiation for our sins so he's our Advocate and he is our propitiation what does that mean we'll put this down our defense rests in Jesus Christ the righteous our only hope for defense rests in the person of Jesus Christ the righteous the idea is this we need someone to represent us if you will in the trial of he said well wait a minute I thought that was a done deal people confuse and justification all the time justification is that work that is finished once for all sanctification is the ongoing work of becoming more like the Lord the reason we ask for forgiveness is because we want our fellowship restored with Lord remember I talked about that you can't lose sonship but you do lose Fellowship we need to be restored that's why we need to confess our sins but our defense rests in Jesus Christ the righteous now when it calls him our advocate if anyone sins and by the way the Greek means and you do since you sin not if there's one or two here you know this idea of going around going do you still sin not too much I'm not really I'm I mean who says that I told you the young man who asked me that years ago he was a 16 year old kid in high school started coming to church heard me teach the Bible every week I'm an older man even at that point you know not as old as I am now but double his age and so he came to me and he said can we get together Bob I said", "sure he came over to the house we sat down because I just had one question he said do you he was dead serious he said do you still sin and I just kind of waited let me see what should I say about that I was I'll be honest I was tempted just because he wouldn't believe me he literally thought you know I'm the spiritual guy because that's all he saw me is being spiritual and reading the Bible and now he'd never seen me sin I just said hang around for a few my kids are running around I'm sure I'd wasn't gonna show him how I sin but I do I I just said you're just not around me yes I still sin John's saying if we act or pretend we don't sin we're lying there's a way to prevent sin that don't ever forget that don't use that as an excuse but when we do sin because we're going to sin we need to know God's provision for that and that is this idea of Jesus being my Advocate now the word advocate in the Greek speaks of what we would consider a defense attorney somebody who speaks up on our behalf when we have no right to speak up at all jot down Zechariah 3 verses 1 through 4 Zechariah 3 verses 1-4 it says then he showed me Joshua the high priest standing before the angel of the Lord and Satan was standing at his right hand to accuse him this is a courtroom scene before God and the Lord said to Satan the Lord rebuke you Satan indeed the Lord who has chosen Jerusalem rebuked you is this not a brand plucked from the fire now Joshua was clothed with filthy garments that's a symbol of sin and standing before the angel and said to those who were standing before him this is the Angel remove the filthy garments from Joshua and again he said to him see I have taken your iniquity away from you and I will clothe you with festal robes what an incredible picture from the Old Testament there's a that I like it's called Praise Him and it says these words that you can picture that scripture when I share it through the blood of Jesus his righteousness is like a robe upon you clothing and covering his garments of praise will now Adorn you you'll live and Reign forever as Kings and Priests and Sons he'll call his own his blood is flowing in you now royalty has finally found a place in you this beautiful truth Isaiah 61 says I will rejoice", "greatly in the Lord my soul will exult in God for he has clothed me with the garments of Salvation he has wrapped me with a robe of righteousness as a bridegroom decks himself with a Garland and has a bride adorns herself with her Jewels this is what God has done he puts on us these righteous garments but first he removes our sin but what's interesting in the picture is we have this courtroom scene and you have Satan he's the accuser of the Brethren Revelation 12 10. he still is by the way he accuses us day and night before God is the picture he looks at the fact that we still sin as Believers that he wants to bring that evidence before God and just like in Zechariah he is well he's like the D.A from Hell literally Joshua has nothing to say in his own defense the evidence couldn't be more I I read of a case where a man was accused of stealing some boots from a shoe store I went in and robbed the store and he stole some boots during the trial the judge looked down the guy was wearing the stolen boots you know how much of a defense are right there Joshua has the evidence he's what could he say what did he need to say God's not on your case today if you're a Believer because Jesus has taken your case he's your advocate I love the words of that great hymn no merit of mine known his anger to suppress my only hope is found in Jesus righteousness and now for me he stands before my father's Throne he shows his wounded hands and names me as his own for me he died for me he lives an everlasting life and light he freely gives you see Jesus Christ became your Redeemer the day that you received him as your savior and Lord but he is retained he's on retainer as a Advocate attorney ever since jot down Hebrews 7 and verse 25. Hensel so he Jesus is able to say forever those who draw near to God through him since he always lives to make intercession for him then put this down number two Christ's sacrifice is the basis for our final verdict Christ is ever living to make intercession for me now is my Advocate when I sin he is the one who presents himself I don't have to justify myself I but he is also put in the word sacrifice in verse two he is the propitiation not exactly a word you use all the time at work and at home", "glad we have some propitiation a big word that crisis our Advocate means that he takes our case now that he is our propitiation means that he's already taken our condemnation the word propitiation in the Greek is the word helasmus along with the other word connected to italysterian it is used in Greek version of the Old Testament called the Septuagint on a number of occasions when it refers to the mercy seat which is the lid of the Ark of the Covenant remember in the holy of holies of God's templin in the Tabernacle that place that the high priest it was so holy God dwelt there he he lived in fact he called that Mercy Seat his throne his presence was manifested in the Shekinah Glory of God there one man once a year after sacrifices has been made for his sin and for the sins of the nation a goat's blood would be taken in and he would go in with sometimes trembling before a holy God to put that blood to sprinkle that blood on The Mercy Seat a lid of the Ark of the Covenant inside the Ark of the coven among other things were the tablets of the law that God's people had broken the evidence against them and in between the presence of a holy God above the mercy seat and the broken law what interceded was the shed blood of the goat that innocent goat that was taking the place it's called substitutionary atonement in theology and God had them live that out once a year on the holiest day of the year Yom and so this picture of the Old Testament the helasmus the the propitiation the place where where the wrath of God the holy demands of God were satisfied is a reference here to the person of Jesus Christ he is the place the only place where God's Wrath has been true story happened over in Germany some years ago there were some men working on they were Building a Church a high ceiling or a roof on this place and they were working on it and one of their workers fell and fell off the roof his fellow worker ran to the ladder to get down thinking for sure he would be dead from the fall and he was alive what lesson alive was the lamb that had been feeding he fell on this lamb killed it that guy was so grateful he actually had a statue made which is still in that church yard that says Memorial to a jot down Isaiah 53 verses 5 and 6. Isaiah 53 verse 5.", "Isaiah says this but he was pierced through for our transgressions he was for our iniquities the chastening for our well-being fell upon him and by his scourging we are all of us like sheep have gone astray each to his own way but the Lord has caused the iniquity of us all to fall on him that he's my Advocate gives me confidence that when I ask for forgiveness God's not going to say nah you don't mean it this time nah you said that last time don't you love the fact that the Lord says he removes your past sins as far as the East is from the West you ever thought about that if you get on a plane at LAX and you're heading east though if you were on Air Force One president's plan do you know that's the only plane of its kind that can be in the air forever they could do midair fueling on that plane so it never has to land ever that crazy it's true not saying they would do it but they can do it so you get on that plane and you start flying East and you keep flying East and East and you can keep flying yeast for the rest of your life and for all eternity because you'll never hit West you'll just keep going east I'm really glad God says I have separated your sins from you as far as the East is from the West they'll never praise God he didn't say Bob I'm separating your sins as far as the south is from the north because if you got on that same plane and stayed in the air from the South Pole and you win 20 000 miles and you curved over the say hi to Santa you're gonna start going South because North and South meet on this planet see I don't that's not far enough for me south to North if he had separated my sins as far as it sounds that's not far enough for me I don't want to meet the old Bob nobody misses him you'd be grateful the propitiation for your sins means that he has forever finished the work on your sin that needs to be done for the rest of your life the resource is already there you know if you're ever over in Italy some of you how many you've been to Italy all right we can envy you and you get to go north and you get to go to Florence one of the places you may visit is a museum of Michelangelo's works you should take that in Michelangelo's amazing artist sculptor I", "mean incredible in his day and to this however he did start some things that he never finished in fact there's a whole Warehouse of his unfinished Works did you know that now Michelangelo was a genius but he when Jesus died he left no unfinished he said I have done what the father gave me to do and on the cross he said to tell us die it is done it's finished you see all other religions say do Christianity says done period he's done the work so that you can draw and because of that he doesn't have to be angry at us anymore somebody was writing an analogy of this propitiation and I liked it so let me share with you they said while driving 100 miles an hour through downtown I'm pulled over by the cops they take me into custody and then into a courtroom but although I walk in with knees knocking and forehead perspiring I'm greatly relieved to discover that the presiding judge is my dad now there's a smile on my face even after the evidence against me is presented after all the judges my father and dad surely knows that boys will be but imagine my surprise when I hear his voice Thunder guilty the finest five thousand dollars or five years how can that be I cry you're my dad sir he answers it's true I'm your father but today in this courtroom I'm also your judge and Justice must be done so I opened my wallet to pay the final I find is a crumbled dollar bill and some and as the bailiff is about to slap cuffs on my wrist and hold me off to Jail the judge stands up deliberately takes off his robe leaves the bench to stand beside me and to pay my fight in full thus Justice is served because the price for my crime is paid not by me but by my father who Paid a Debt I'm completely unable to pay jot down Romans 3 verses 21-26 Romans 3. 21-26 that's Romans 8 we want Romans 3 if we can do that one there we go here's what Paul says but now apart from the law the righteousness of God has been manifested being witnessed by the law and the prophets even the righteousness of God through faith in Jesus for all those who believe for there is no distinction all have sinned and fallen short of the glory of God being justified declared not guilty as a gift by his grace through the Redemption which is in Christ Jesus who God displayed publicly as a propitiation in", "his blood through faith this was to demonstrate God's righteousness as a judge because in the forbearance of God he passed over the sins previously committed for the demonstration I say of his righteousness at the present time that he may be just by demanding that verdict and the justifier giving mercy of the one who has faith in Jesus Paul lays it out and explains it in a way we can all understand you know um in the 1960s 1968 the winner of Best Picture was a story about Sir Thomas Moore Sir Thomas More that name might not mean anything to you a movie was called Man For All Seasons you may have heard of that Sir Thomas Moore was the prelet who stood up against the king who had decided he would divorce his wife and marry and Belen and he said this this Catholic priest said you can't do that that's dishonoring to God and as a result he lost his life he gave up his life for his convictions about what God's word said interesting title Man For All Seasons our text says that Jesus is the propitiation not just for our sins but for the sins of the whole world Jesus Christ is the savior for all Sinners not you see we're in this life and we want to have victory over sin but we need to remember we're on Mission Satan wants to use sin in your life to keep you from being a witness from ever witnessing from sharing your faith with other people Jesus Christ came to deal with our sin but not just ours it's not just for us it's also for the people around us who don't know the Lord remember seeing a commercial years ago and in the commercial there was a Mercedes that was on one of those crash tests with the dummies and they you know slow motion they ran it into it and then this guy with a lab coat went over to look at the damage it was pretty minimal on the car and there was a journalist who was talking to the the lab worker and he said to the lab work he said Is it true that Mercedes-Benz has created a a design that absorbs the energy in the crashes and he said yes that's true and the journalist said is it also true that they've decided not to enforce the patent on that Discovery and on that invention and that other people are actually using other manufacturers are just using it he said that's right and the person said well why why would Mercedes do that and I love the answer", "the guy said there are some things in life that are too important not to share and that's one of them it was too important not to share and let people use that technology two important not to share not everything fits that bill t-i-n-t-s that's how I remember it two when Fleming discovered penicillin too important not to share when salt figured out the vaccine for polio too important not just there have been hundreds and thousands of discoveries in medicine in science that are too important not to share but can I tell you something there is one discovery that outweighs all of them combined and it's the good news of Jesus Christ that's what you have it's too important not to share that's why you're still on this planet God has a plan to use you Satan has a plan to Sidetrack you to discourage you to keep you from ever sharing what you know but you know things there's people all around you who don't know can't know won't know how will they believe in him and whom they have never heard how will they hear unless someone is sent guess what that's you that's me Lord I ask that you would help us to see that you want us to deal with sin because it hurts our relationship with you but it also hurts our witness for Lord there are people in our lives that are looking at us and wondering about our faith wondering if it's real wondering if it's genuine wondering if it's for them Lord we might work with them and they've never said that to us but we're the only witness perhaps in their life or our children are checking you out by checking us out and Lord we want to be a witness not of perfection because we're not going to be able to be you but we want to be one who is an honest sinner who needs forgiveness gets forgiveness and grows Lord we're thankful that you are our Advocate now and you are our propitiation 2000 years ago that we don't have to worry about the condemnation of sin or the separation that sin causes because of your work now help us to remember that we need to share that message with a lost world in Jesus name amen let's all stand okay we're gonna use the end of the service today uh by asking you to come forward so we did that last week I'd like to do it again come on down to the front and if you don't have room to come down at least get out of your seat we", "want you to to kind of be with the Lord before the Lord because I believe sometimes we get into this habit of doing things a certain way and it's like all right closing so I'm gonna go get my kids got to get in line to get the cafe and got to get out of here yeah well we have time to do something a little different and I want you to be before the Lord and I want you to say Lord if I've looked into the mirror and I see some things about my life about Sin I've been accepting it help me then to make a decision now with your help that I'm gonna have Victory but you come forward let's just worship him for a few minutes here praise the father the other side knowing this was our praise the father praise the Sun in the church shall not fade rain came in Jesus thank you because the things that are seen are product is we still we still have a habit of looking at the things that we see the things not just physical but those relationships those problems that are that feel impending and maybe you're at that place where you feel like your life is Crashing Down maybe right now that's exactly that's what a gal came up to me after first service and I just feel my life was falling down crushing it around and there are times that God's going to allow that to happen to seem like your life is crashing down and maybe from the outside it is we don't look at the things that are seen because the things that are seen are temporal the things that are unseen are Eternal God wants to give you eyes to see the things here's what the writer of the Hebrew says there's coming a time of a shaking that everything that can be shaken will be shaken so that the things that can't be shaken will remain maybe just maybe there's some things going on in your life that are shaking because God's wanting you to stop holding on to them for your hope for your purpose for your peace maybe he is going to take some things out of the way so that you have one person to hold on to and it's the person who will never leave you nor forsake you not saying he's doing that but I'm saying if he does he is worthy of Your Love of your faith and your your confidence that he will be enough hold on to him trust him maybe a lot of", "you aren't going through that right now but there are some of you that are or that away for that moment Lord I don't know if I'm going to say I'm glad when everything's shaken but I'm glad for that which can never be shaken now may the Lord bless you may he keep you protect you may he make intimacy with him shine upon you 'll be gracious to you may he lift up his countenance upon you that means you have his favor when a king lets you see his face it meant that he was wanting to hear what you had to say it meant that you're probably going to get what you're a lift up is countenance upon you and give you his peace in the name of the father and the Son and the Holy Spirit", "all what's the next word scattered same word is used in James 1 1 like seed they were all scattered throughout the regions of where Judea and Samaria is that sound familiar that's exactly where he in symptom Jerusalem Judea Samaria that was area 2 and 3 they hadn't gone there but now they're going there jot down acts 11 and verse 19 but later in the book of Acts so then those who were scattered same word like seed because of the persecution that occurred in connection with Stephen made their way to Phoenicia and Cypress that's an island the island of Cyprus finishes the coast north of Israel and Antioch now Antioch is up in Turkey speaking the word to no one except to Jews alone but let me tell you some they are in Gentile territory and this is the beginning of the gospel going out to Gentiles yes it went to the synagogues first in these places but these places were full of Gentiles it's the beginning of the remotest parts of the earth I just think it's so important to see that we're not much different than Israel we personally have a tendency of taking that come and go in all the world yes Lord here am i send him you know we we can like right where we are somebody has said this they said Christians are like manure when we're spread out we can do a lot good but clump together we start to stink you know there in the book of Acts it says in chapter 6 when the church began to multiply when the disciples began to multiply there was a murmuring that started among them that interesting as they start growing in number problems start happening among them and maybe that's because we're not willing to do what God's called us to do just like the world was told gold spread out don't want to not going to can't make us oh a young girl in Bible College went in to talk to one of her professors she said I have a problem he said what's that she said I I love the Lord I'm a Christian but I just I struggle with really totally dedicating my life to him he said why is that she said my fear is if I do that that he'll send me to I don't know Mongolia to be a missionary or something because I'm terrified of that he said you don't have to be afraid God loves you he's made you for wherever he wants to use you don't have to worry about where he's", "gonna send you do need to get this issue you need to settle this you need to settle it right away and so she prayed with him and she said I'm just gonna give my life to the Lord and I'll trust him next semester he didn't see her for a while she came back she said you know I changed my major he said what's your major now she said X I'm a missions major so that's awesome he said in fact I'm going out after I graduate so where are you going so the Lord's coming to Mongolia I can't wait I can't wait and I think sometimes we're resisting the very thing that God wants to do and I were afraid of it I can't do that that would be so uncomfortable and God saying oh you don't know what I want to do with your life it is for a good reason that I've called you to that whatever that is well but this don't see where a great name comes from I told you this is about names left to themselves which the world was godless at this point they start to develop what I call eye problems it's all about if you look at verse 4 it's all about themselves let us build for who our selves a city of a tower whose top will reach an outlet us made for ourselves a name lest we be scared it's all about about them you know if you think about it's like here are here's the world with all of its resources all of its money all of its wisdom all of us engineering power by the way the people of these in this ancient times were actually quite sophisticated much more than most people in terms of engineering in terms of artistry in terms all kinds of use of metals and here you have all the wealth all the brainpower of man all together to build for themselves a city and a name a name and yet really who can remember even one of the people who built it actually I do know one Nimrod but he's not mentioned in the text very interesting purposely I think left out here you see the wisdom of the crowd to make their name count and frankly nobody remembers any of them and here's what you're supposed to do at this point in the reading you're to contrast all the rest of the world who wanted to have a great name that doesn't wind up with one with a old weak childless couple that nobody knows named Abram and Sarai who", "were gonna meet at the end of the in fact jot down Genesis 12 and verse 2 here's what God will say to him day Brum I will make you a great nation and I will bless you and I'll do what I'll make your name great huh and so you shall be a blessing you see what's going on oh the people the world want a great name we're gonna make one for ourselves and they get nothing but God says Abram I'm gonna make your name great and you know thousands and thousands and millions and hundreds of millions of people have lived and died and they know the name Abraham every Muslim knows the name Abraham every Christian knows the name Abraham every Jude knows the name Abraham God says I'm gonna do it and when God does it guess what it works well that's pretty obvious Bible says God as opposed to the proud and gives grace to the humble somebody paraphrased that it says God pickles the proud and preserves the humble that's pretty good you know Charles Dickens run among other things a Tale of Two Cities tell Two Cities is about the French Revolution it's a focus on two cities London Paris and the differences between them but do you know someone has said really the Bible is about two cities - it's a tale of two it's the city of Babylon in both its physical and future kingdoms and spiritual Kingdom that represents as satan rules through man what did nebuchadnezzar say is this not babylon the great that i have built the god humble some satanic really just like satan I don't need God I'll send I'll be God I'll take the throne you know rebellion against God's what Nimrod was it says who Antichrist will be that's what man is in our own hearts in the contrast of that physical earthly city of pride is with a heavenly city the New Jerusalem two cities one built for the glory of man and one built for the glory of God which one are you building which one are you living for because the first one will come to nothing what an ironic reversal of fortunes they wanted to make a name for themselves and at the end of the day they couldn't even pronounce each other's names their language was completely confused well jot down acts 2 verses 4 through 6 by the way I don't see God creating race in the Bible Caucasians you know Hispanic American Indian Chinese nope create races God created listen to me created man and he he did separate man and confuse their languages there's", "about seven thousand different languages in the world today God did do that people separated not according to race they separated according to language according to the Bible it's important that we know that those things that we typically think of of being racial differences not it's not at the essence of what man is at all like I said there is only one race the human race but it is languages that separated men from the very beginning well it's very interesting to me in Acts chapter two is in a sense at Pentecost you see somewhat of a reversal of Babel Acts chapter 2 says you know the children you know the disciples were all gathered together and they were all filled with the Holy Spirit this is in the Upper Room on Pentecost and they began to speak with other tongues or languages as the spirit was giving them utterance now there were Jews living in Jerusalem devout men from every nation under heaven and when this sound this mighty rushing wind occurred the crowd came together and they were bewildered King James or numeric written sentences confounded they were confused because each one of them was hearing them speak in his own language now very interesting to me God does a miracle of sent when he sends the Holy Spirit and rather than confusing languages so people can't understand each other now you have people all being able to communicate in languages that people do understand because they're followers of Jesus Christ in the Holy Spirit is filling them listen the secret of unity you guys is having the same Holy Spirit filling us living for the glory of God that is the essence you want to be unified with anybody else that's where it happened that's where man is unified in heaven there'll be lots of different languages language groups from people that got safe but we're all gonna understand each other but this down letter B we need to follow the scriptural line of reasoning now in verses 10 through 25 there might be a stand for it but I'm just gonna quickly go through these names I know you love names these are the records verse 10 of the generations of Shem what does Shem mean anybody remember news name this is about the name Shem was a hundred years old and he became the father of somebody in verse 10 two years after the flood okay arpachshad you like that and Shem lived 500 years after he became the father of our brashaad and he had other sons and daughters our Prashad lived 35 years he became the father of Shella and", "arpachshad lived four hundred and three years and he became the father of shell and he had other sons and daughters Shella lived thirty years became the father of Eber remember Eber is probably where we get the word wet Hebrew the first Hebrew Abraham will be called the Hebrew but the descendants of Eber they believe that those are related and shall I live four hundred and three years after he became the father of Eber other sons and daughters Eber lived 34 years became the father of Peleg and Abraham 430 years after he became the father of Peleg which means divided and he had other sons and daughters they like the 30 years became the father of rooh Peleg lived 209 years after he became the father of ruied he had other sons and daughters rule of 32 years became the father of Sarab Andrew lived 207 years after he became the father of Serik and he had other sons and daughters sarag lived 30 became the father of nahor and sura glyph two hundred years after he became the father of nahor and he had other sons and daughters nahor lived 29 years became the father of Tara and nahor lived 119 years after he became the father of Tara and he had other sons and daughters now let me just say something about this genealogy it is very clear what the Holy Spirit is doing and Moses is doing he's not too interested in developing these people's lives he is giving the briefest genealogy to get us from Shem to Abram he's about to introduce Abram this is kind of something called it a funnel it's the fastest way he just got to give you the least amount of details because he wants to move on with the story but there is information here and I think it's worth pointing out so put a couple of principles we'll draw from this genealogy we'll move on first of all we see sin defin leads to diminished returns diminished returns after the flood by the way Noah lived to be anybody remember how old he old nine hundred and fifty years old third oldest man who ever lived oldest man was Methuselah right after the flood Noah lives to be 950 but here in this genealogy we discovered that by with time we get to the end roll he's only a hundred 48 years old 148 seems ridiculously long to us but it was not very long for him compared to those who had lived before him and so each generation there they're just dying sooner and sooner and and so you might", "say this life they could tell is brief forgive the pun but relatively speaking what's happening is every successive generation dies younger in this particular genealogy now if I said to you how would you feel if you got to live to be 130 years old say wow that would be amazing I'd be really old I don't know if I'd want to live here that long you know but it all depends on who you are I want you to jot down Genesis 47 and verse 9 where we read about Jacob who is brought to a joke and he gets to meet the ruler of the world his name was pharaoh and pharaoh asks him the question he can tell he's an old guy and he you know doesn't have to worry about offending anybody how old are you that's the verse right before this one how many years you got because you just wants to know so Jacob said to Pharaoh the years of my sojourning meaning my life are 130 but here's how he describes 130 years whew and unpleasant have been the years of my davin and many nor have they attained to the years that my father's lived during the days of their sojourning very interesting here he's lived to be 130 and he's complaining most of us assume we'll go in I'd be complaining to that I'm still here on this earth but but very interesting to me because you know it's all relative when you think about it by the way it is interesting Jacob will die at a hundred and forty seven which is one year shy of the youngest person in this list but going down sin seems to have this growing effect on the on the lifespan of people as what we probably can take from this if you think about it - sin brings into our lives unexpected and unfulfilled expectations we don't always live as long as we thought we would or that we thought we should my dad died at 65 my brother last year died it apart of me my brother died at 65 my dad died at 63 that's very old you know and Here I am I'm sixty it's like okay what does that mean maybe I'm going to heaven sooner than I think I don't know I really know Lord knows but when you think about that as as people we would like to live at least as long as our parents but for a whole line of people they didn't they all lived less time on this earth than their parents did and maybe you compare yourself with your mom", "or your dad and you go oh I live as long as them I don't know I'm not saying you won't because of this list see there are things that we don't expect to happen like we don't expect to bury our children but look at verse 28 will sneak ahead Quran died in the presence of this father Terah you see what we have here are the effects of sin people living less and less and people even burying their children before they die it's all happening here in our text so sin leads to diminishing returns and the second principle their lives in this in this genealogy revolve around special births but in the word births on the earth unlike the genealogy in Genesis 5 where you just have a line of so and so begat so on so you have a phrase that's repeated over and over again in Genesis 5m he died and he died eight times and he died that's not here we don't have that first focus in that genealogy is about every single one of them died no matter what obviously but here there's something else going on you have the record of a man how long he lived before he had a child now this is not necessarily their firstborn child that's a wrong conclusion by the way all of their children are not listed it says they had other sons and daughters a particular son that is in the line of Abram this is Abraham's genealogy in Reverse it's like there's a line going from Shem to Abraham Moses is letting us know who was in that particular family line and so he said they lived X amount of years you'll see they're all about in their 30s early 30s and they had the particular son that needs to be in the list who will then be the descending line you know this is ancestry.com you know we've got a new leaf on your tree and basically telling the story of Abraham's line now the reason I say that if you didn't put in the fill and put in the word births I find it very interesting that what goes in God's record is that these people became a father of someone God had chosen listen to me to be in his family tree that's what's going on here that's worth putting down in the record you say but what's your point of all that just this we have one life to live on this earth as believers we should esteem the privilege of bringing somebody into the Messiah's line as something of eternal significance that goes down in God's", "book jot down Daniel chapter 12 verses 2 & 3 talking about the resurrection of man it's as many of those who sleep in the dust of the ground will awake these to everlasting life but the others to disgrace and everlasting contempt those who have insight in the resurrection now after the resurrection those who have insight will shine brightly like the brightness of the expanse of heaven and those who lead the many to righteousness like the Stars forever and ever it's very interesting Paul in first Corinthians 15 talks about our resurrection bodies and he says what will they be like and he talks about how they'll be different from each other he says just as stars very similar what Daniel says stars in the heavens differ they have different what we call what scientists call magnitude some stars are much brighter than others that are more faint there's the star Sirius which is very bright compared to Alcor which right and so Paul says when we have our resurrected bodies we'll have different capacities for bringing glory to God different capacities to show what is going to affect our ability to shine in eternity according to Daniel it's gonna have to do with those that lead many to righteousness will shine like the brightness of the firmament the Bible we talked about the son he who is wise wins souls jesus said he who reaps is gathering fruit for eternal life so interesting to me in God's permanent life that's mentioned these guys the whole lives for hundreds of years somebody that went into the Messiah's family we need to be people who are being used by God to bring people into the family of God see I'm doing a class on spiritual development John says I'm writing to you children I'm writing to you young men and I'm writing to you fathers fathers he made every one of us able to reproduce spiritually you may never have children on this earth you may be barren you may never get married you may be a single person but if you're a Christian and you come to maturity you are going to be reproducing by the way that is the definition of maturity did you know that you said what do you mean if you have a fruit tree it's mature when it bears fruit and fruit bear seed that reproduces the life of the plant every believer is called to reproduce and as we grow to maturity that should be the evidence Lord bring people into the kingdom you see goes down in your permanent record when any of us father", "or mother a person that's gonna be around in God's family well put this down literacy choices we make make all the difference put in the word difference in verses 26 through 32 we get through the genealogy and we come to the point of where he wanted to get us he's introduced Terah now in verse 26 Terah lived seventy years and he became the father of Abram can you imagine if your dad was 70 when he gave birth to you but not a big problem because he'll live for two more centuries Terra will be two hundred more years on the earth so don't worry about playing baseball with your son he became verse 20 the father of three sons Abram and Nahor and Haran now these are the records of the generations of Tara Tara became the father of Abram Nahor hen ram and her Anne became the father of lot you know his name and Herat are a harem died in the presence of his father so he died early at some point although he had showed me a lot in the land of his birth in ur of the chaldeans Abram and Nahor took wives for themselves by the way wives are not normally mentioned in genealogies in the ancient world but they are here of because of their significance Abram and Nahor took wives for themselves the name of Abraham's wife was Sarai which means my princess and the name of Mae wife was Milkha the daughter of Haran the father of milta and iske Sarai was barren she had no child Terah took Abram the son and a lot the son of Haran his grandson and Sarai his daughter-in-law his sons his son Abrams wife and they went out together from ur of the chaldeans in order to enter the land of Canaan remember the children of Israel are getting this for Moses and they're heading to Canaan this is where they're going this is the promised land and they went as far as Quran which is not in Canaan and they settled there the days of Terah were 205 years and Terah died in Haran now so Terra's story when we get down to him he has three sons he could have been you know my three sons would be his story Abram his name means anybody know what Abra's name means Abram means hi father or exalted father a little bit difficult no children every time you know hi I'm a high father how many kids you got zero that was the name that he was given Nahor I think maybe this guy had sleep apnea because", "nein horn means snore he just nor does a baby thing I'll just call him snore for me to snort or to snore Koran means a mountaineer don't know if he fell off one but he died now what we're doing what he's the author's doing is introducing us to the main characters in the story what's interesting we spent 11 chapters covering two thousand years of man's and suddenly you might say the Holy Spirit camera slows way down to slow motion and it's gonna spend 14 chapters on the life of Abraham far more important this is where Moses has been trying to get us okay right down to talk about Abraham it's kind of like um it's this we see that God has given man opportunities from the garden man had an opportunity to honor him and to obey Him and he blew it you know come on going up to baseball you you get to swing up this at the pitches right strike one strike two strike three maybe rock garden man blew it that was strike one then in the days of Noah man was continuously evil refused to repent God destroys the world strike two now after the flood once again man gets together he wants to build in rebellion against God a tower ignoring God strike three you'd expect God to say you're done you're out head to the dugout instead he introduces us to his plan God has a man and God has a plan to redeem mankind even rebellious mankind and it's gonna involved Abraham and his family it's really important you see the grace of God all over this passage of Scripture so three names and were finished you can fill him in and you'll be happy Nahor Nahor you put this word state he stayed right where he started it's all we know about him he stayed in her of the kennedys he never left he'd never went toward Canaan he never evidently Terra felt called Abram was pulled by the way Whitney was in ur of Chaldees and his dad they left Nahor did not receive or didn't respond to that calling so name kind of a picture who stays spiritually you might say right where he started I like to say it this way if you are what you've always been you're not a Christian if you are what you've always been you can't be a Christian because jesus said you must this is Matthew 18 you must be converted must be changed to become a child of God so date is a picture of a guy who well he just stayed right", "where he had always been Terah started but then he's simply settled he gets to her end and he never goes beyond that he never gets to the promised land so put in the word settled Terra started out but then he simply settled I think you might say the turn is a picture of kind of incomplete faith you know God promised the children of Israel the Land of Israel the promised land and then two and a half tribes said you know we don't really need to go into the Promised Land we like it right here on the other side of the Jordan this is good let us have this land Moses and and there it's kind of like this picture of the children of Israel who got as far as Kadesh Barnea Kadesh Barnea is the threshold of the promised land and said yeah we don't need to go in there in fact we probably should just go back to Egypt there's no way they're too big we don't want to fight our kids will all die lack of because of lack of faith they died in the wilderness here's what God said Jesus said it to the church at sardis I have not found your works completed in the sight of my god kind of you you started out but somehow you settled for something less than all that God has I think Tara's a good picture that he starts out in the right direction but he settles down he dies there and then finally we have Abram Abram struggled in his faith clearly we'll discover that next time we study but he finally surrendered by the way we won't get into chapter 12 till next time but it's interesting at what point finally Abram yields and goes all the way to Canaan it's when his old man dies that's right it's what his father dies that the call of God and Abram once again receives and responds to the call to go all the way to where God would have them and what a picture that is for us our old man has to die and we have to say I'm gonna yield to God and walk by faith and Abram was not a spring chicken he was an old man when his story of faith starts I think sometimes as we get old we feel like well I could've really best of my life and kind of settled in now you know Abram will never have a home address after he starts following the Lord by he's a sojourner what is a sojourner yeah it's just somebody travels all the", "time somebody's always on the move you know what I think that means for us I think it means that we say Lord no matter how old I am if you want to move me you can if I'm too comfortable if I'm staying with what's convenient if I'm holding on security if you want to use me more and you're calling me out somewhere I want to be ready to go how many people got out of the boat and walked on the water for a little while I mean people laugh at Peter but how many times have you walked on water that jesus lizard tries to do it but let's face it none of us in this room none of us it's like how many of the other disciples could have done it I don't know we'll never know Bob what's your point just this what if God wants to use you in ways that you don't imagine you're not asking we're not even open to in fact we're I'm clinging to security and God saying Oh Bob by you clinging to security you're actually an opposition to what I want to do with your life I have more that I still want to do then what I've done then I say Lord if that's true make the open I don't want to be somebody who stayed where I started I don't want to be someone who starts out and then settles I want to be somebody who if I've struggled so be it but I want to surrender and go into all that God has let's pray Lord tonight I thank you for men and women who are here to study your word as we are walking through Genesis Lord together we see events that changed our world we see the nature of man hasn't changed at all that man wants to try to come together but it's in rebellion against you Lord trying to achieve what you want to give us you don't want us to try to climb up to achieve anything with you you want to well you came down Lord you came down that ladder that your son is to meet with us and I pray for people here who feel far from you and don't know how to Jew I pray Lord that you'd find them I pray that you'd reveal yourself to them I pray for those of us that feel stagnant or that we are or our song and our spiritual jukebox is how dry I am or we haven't received a fresh and filling of your spirit for some time haven't", "heard you speak to us haven't felt you say get out of the boat and come to me the Lord would you awaken us like you're going to awaken Abram in Chapter 12 would you help us to allow the old man to die so that we might be free of those things that pull us towards security and toward conformity this with this world Lord we need you I need you fill us afresh in Jesus name", "you there's nothing better Lord we have seen it there's nothing better than you and being in your presence Lord we may try to replace that which was made for you in our hearts with other things with other Idols Lord but may we lay those down at your feet this morning and every day every moment when we're presented with a moment to bow down to something that can't answer us and it doesn't hear us may we only bend the knee to you Lord in everything that we do Lord Jesus may you get all the glory and the honor Lord in your name I pray I search the world but it couldn't fill me that's empty praise Treasures that enough and you can long put me back together and every desire is now satisfied hear in your better oh there's nothing better than you Lord there's nothing better than you nothing is better than you I'm Not Afraid show you my weakness my failure Lord Lord you see the more and you still call me praise cu the god of the mountain is the god of the valley there's not a place your mercy and Grace

enjoyed his message God has big plans for what he's going to do with that man's life hey we're glad you're here and uh if you would open your Bibles to the book of Jude second to the last book of the New Testament We are continuing our verse by verse study of what we really think is a preface to the Book of Revelation where we will be in T minus 9 verses after I finish today I've been looking forward to it for quite a while uh book of Jude verses 12-6 describing these false teachers that Jude is saying were already in the church in the first century and a description throughout the ages for us to be aware of beginning in verse 12 he says these these false teachers are the men who are hidden Reeves in your love feasts when they Feast with you without fear caring for themselves their clouds without water carried Along by winds their Autumn trees without fruit doubly dead up uprooted Wild Waves of the sea casting up their own Shamel likee foam their wandering Stars For Whom the black darkness has been reserved forever then he says it was about these that Enoch in the Seventh Generation from Adam prophesied he said behold the Lord comes with many thousands of his holy ones to execute judgment upon all to convict all the ungodly of all their ungodly Deeds which they have done in an ungodly way and of all the harsh things which ungodly Sinners have spoken against him there are grumblers who find fault following after their own lusts they speak arrogantly flattering people for the sake of gaining an advantage father as we read this list of description we confess we need to be aware but we don't want to see ourselves and our own characteristics today in the mirror of your word but you have said that we are to look look into the law of Liberty as a mirror and Lord if we see something that needs to be adjusted or changed to not be hearers but doers so Lord help us to receive the warning but also take full heed of the description and we pray that we would be Christlike in each one of these areas where these men are the opposite so fill us with your spirit give us eyes to see what our flesh will", "never see but help us to take home those lessons you have for us today in Jesus name we pray amen you can be seated I realize uh that occasionally and this book in particular maybe I may wind up today uh scratching where no one's itching you say what do you mean well I happen to know what people happen to like to hear messages on I like to hear messages about how do I handle my circumstances and trust God how do I pray and how do I have God's peace and how do I have God's blessing on my life I understand we all want that um but I want to read to you a verse that I'm thinking of today and I think of this section Paul the Apostle writes to Timothy in his final words to him before he dies he says it's time for me I've ended my race it's time for me to be poured out like a drink Paul because it say Last Words recorded in the Bible before we know he was killed he says this in that final chapter to Timothy I solemnly charge you in the presence of God and of Christ Jesus who is to judge the living and the dead by his appearing and his kingdom word be ready in season and out reprove rebuke and exhort with great patience and instruction for the time will come when they will not endure sound Doctrine but wanting to have their ears tickled they will accumulate for themselves teachers in accordance with their own desires and they'll turn their ears away truth and I'm very aware that the last days we will see according to the Bible a great falling away from the truth of God's word oh there will still be people teaching the Bible there will be people preaching the Bible the Sunday after the Rapture folks because there are plenty of churches that don't honor the Lord and even pastors who don't know the Lord and plenty of people who will continue to follow Jesus on their own terms 1957 was a good year for me I was born and I guess it was a good year for a senator named John Fitzgerald Kennedy because he actually wrote a book became a bestseller got a pulit Sur prise for it called profiles encourage whether or not he wrote the whole whole thing is a another issue but it was a book about eight senators and how they stood up for what was right the cost of sometimes their popularity and sometimes even their position but they did the right thing profiles and", "courage and I thought of that when I thought of this section that I'm about to teach in that's why my message title is profiles in corruption because you see you got to remember the context of the book John or pardon me Jude says I meant to write to you I intended at first to write to you about our common salvation I wanted to write a message that would encourage you and speak to you but I felt compelled I felt the necessity instead by the Lord instead to tell you to contend for the faith because of these wicked men who he said have crept into the church unawares what that tells me is Judah saying I'm telling you about a concern that you don't have I'm going to warn you about something that you're not really warned about or worried about at all right now but you ought to be and I realize that the word of God does that it helps us to know about things that we're not even sensitive to at all and I feel like that may be true for some of us today we're looking for something that we need and there's nothing wrong with that but sometimes the Lord wants to speak to us about something that we are oblivious to these wicked false teachers are in the church already but nobody seems to even be aware that they are there so you say well how can we recognize them if we if they crept in through the side doors Jude is given the mission by God to be if you will God's sketch artist to describe them all through this book to describe those who are spiritually sketchy you might say Jesus Christ repeatedly said regarding the end times beware of false teachers they will come you as wolves in sheep's clothing they appear to be Believers or even Godly men on the outside but inwardly they are ravenous wolves David in the Psalms said this He Who Walks With Integrity is the one who will minister to me not just the one who speaks accurately or powerfully that's not enough it's about character if you're taking down vers as many of you are jot down these 1 Timothy 4 and verse 1 1 Timothy 4:1 but the spirit of God explicitly says in the latter times some will fall away from the faith you hear that word apostasy maybe you're not sure what it means well let me just give it to you right from the Greek apostasy is two Greek words APO is apos a preposition means away from that's what", "it's used to to depart or to be away from stasis is a word that means to stand it means to stand away from something and the apostate is one who stands away from the truth they either at one time claimed or appeared to believe in they have walked away purposefully willfully from the truth and the word of God is replete with warnings all through it not only will they be judged but Jesus in his ministry Paul in his ministry John and Peter and Jude are warning the church that in the last days there will be false teachers in fact John goes further the proof he says that we're not only in the last days but in the last hour jot it down 1 John 2 and: 18 children it is the last hour and just as you heard Antichrist is coming even now many antichrists have Arisen and from this we know that it is the last hour that's why I will continue to harp on this topic of yes study everything that's going on in the world prophetically and get excited about it but please don't miss the most powerful message all through the scriptures about apostasy being an evidence that we're in the last days and the danger of false teaching teachers that Christians aren't even aware of at all because we need to be aware of it these are the days we're living in put this down we're going to now look at the text and first of all Jude you might say paints six pictures from creation to help identify the six the sick preachers in the congregation put in the word destructive they are naturally destructive what all six of these have in common is something of a of a technique Jesus uses when he preaches Jesus uses a lot of allegories or or analogies from nature he speaks for instance in John 3 about the wind the person who's born of the spirit of God you you you can understand it by considering the wind the wind's invisible but it's real and he talks about this spiritual thing with a something natural Jesus talks about how God provides for the grass how he he adorns the grass with beautiful flowers Solomon and all of his glory wasn't AR raay like the grass that Withers at the end of the day Jesus would talk about fish he would talk about sry he used nature and so is Jude in these next few uh all six of these uh illustrations you might say so let's take a look at them one at a time first of all put in the", "word reefs these false teachers Among Us are hidden reefs that are well waiting to be run into put in the word reefs and run in the text he says verse 12 there they are the men who are hidden reefs in feasts when they Feast with you without fear now he is referring to something that was a practice in the early church that was known as the Agape Feast the Agape Feast was how Christians originally would come together they would come together to hear the word of God and to worship and to have communion at each of their meetings and they would also have a meal someone has said probably the closest thing to the modern-day Agape Feast that the church and I've often said I don't like that term pot luck because I don't believe in either pot or luck so I don't like to use it but anyway you get the idea it's about the Christians coming together to share a meal remember in the book of Corinthians Paul had a problem when they would come together for this Agape Feast because they were coming together supposedly to celebrate the Lord's Supper he said but you're not really celebrating the Lord's Supper there's people among you who are hungry and the people who have money are gorging themselves and the people are going hungry some of you are drunk you're coming to getting drunk and this is cuz you're so carnal you're not really celebrating the Lord's Supper though you're going through the motions and so this is what he's referring to in other words these false teachers are engaged in The Fellowship of the church they don't just come on Sunday morning and leave oh no they're totally engaged with people and whenever the church meets they're coming on Wednesday nights they're coming on the community groups here but they don't come really to minister they don't come to feed the sheep they come to feed themselves and that's because they don't love the Sheep they just love lamb chops they come to use and abuse God's people so they're hidden reefs you know the problem with a Hidden Reef is well hidden in Acts 27 Paul the Apostle on his way to Rome all expense paid because he's a prisoner he always wanted to go to Rome to preach he's going there but he's going there because he's a prisoner he on board a ship and in act 27 the ship hits a Hidden Reef and then once it's stuck there the storm that he's in destroys the ship God miraculously saves everybody on board but that's the", "problem with the Hidden Reef you you know there's a Hidden Reef by running into it I've often said describing people that are dangerous in the body of Christ you know you've heard me say it many times some people are blessing wherever they go others are a blessing whenever they go these people I think are being talked about in The Book of Romans keep your eyes on those who cause divisions in the body of Christ avoid them because you see a Hidden Reef you only find out about it basically two ways you run into it or you see the debris of others who have and so these guys are basically you're going to find them after the fact I wish I had ever run into them we'll put this down number two they raise hopes but they're all hype in our text it says this they are clouds without water carried Along by the winds now I don't know about you I'm personally a fan for clouds without water if it doesn't rain today I'll be fine um I pray for the rain to hold back when we have Sunday church services I know some people's like ah it's raining can't go but um maybe they should stay home but uh this idea in the world that we're reading about in the first century is completely dependent on water supply in the Middle East well everywhere really water is life and so if it doesn't rain crops die people die animals die you got to understand what the picture is there are clouds that appear that they're going to rain it just it just never does they just blow right through Proverbs 25:14 is no doubt where Jude is getting his imagery here Proverbs 254 says like clouds and wind Without Rain Is a man who boasts of his falsely in other words they appear to be those who if you will are Heavenly in abilities full of the ability to provide a blessing but in the final analysis they never deliver second Peter 2: 19 describes these same false teachers promising people freedom but they themselves are slaves for corruption by whatever A man is overcome by this he is enslaved in other words they seem when you first meet them or get to know them wow God's going to use them in my life you know they seem to be flying at a higher plane than I am but then after a while they're just in the wind the idea that they're going to bring rain by the way probably is an analogy with the word of God that they have the capacity to", "really bring the word Isaiah 55: 10 and 11 for as the rain and the snow come down from heaven they don't return there without watering the Earth making it bare Sprout Furnishing seed to the sewer and bread to the eater God says so shall my word be which Goes Forth from my mouth it shall not return to me void or empty without accomplishing what I desire and without succeeding in the matter for which I sent it so the rain from the clouds is in the Bible a picture if you will of the ministry of the word of God and also the grace of God he sends the rain on the just and the unjust so these folks appear to be those who are going to minister powerfully the word of God and yet when it all comes down to it they're just in the wind they're just moving on to another place Ephesians 4:14 speaks of the Winds as being connected Ed with false teaching Paul says we're to grow up in the body of Christ in Ephesians 4 into Christ and it says as a result we are no longer to be children tossed to and fro by the trickery of men by the craftiness and deceitful scheming but we're to grow up in all aspects into Christ who is the head he and so we're to mature through the word of God through the people of God through using our gifts but the false Doctrine is like the winds and these guys are carried about by these winds then number three on your outline they are spiritually fruitless and spiritually rootless put in those words if you're taking notes he describes them here this way he says they are Autumn trees why Autumn trees because that's when the crops come in that's when you're expecting to get the fruit they are Autumn trees but they are fruitless without without fruit they are doubly dead the Greek says twice dead they are are uprooted now the idea of having no root and no fruit come to us again and again in scripture Jesus Remember in the parable of the soils is really what it's about describes the word of God going out as seed and goes everywhere some of it falls on the Wayside and doesn't germinate at all some of it does produce a crop but there's two other seeds you remember this one of the seeds falls on shallow soil Springs up immediately but having no root in itself because the Sun comes out and scorches it which is a picture of Trials Withers away there's", "no root one of the other ones falls on thorny soil remember that one it also Springs up immediately there's a reaction to the word of God a person praise the prayer receives Christ gets excited about the Lord whatever but it's only temporary because it's choked out it never produces any fruit at all the True Believer listen to me on this you guys in the Bible is pictured as having a root and and having fruit the root speaks of permanence we don't earn our salvation by by staying with the Lord we evidence our Salvation that's 1 Corinthians 15 Paul says I make known to you the gospel by which you're saved if you continue lest you believed in vain remember John says they went out from us because well they were never really of us if they had been of us they would have remained with us but they went out that it might become manifest that they were never really of us root and fruit and these false teachers though they claim to be teachers claim to have a special relationship with the Lord and something to give might be impressive but the bottom line is they either by the way that's why I believe they're twice dead the fruit of course is you can see it on a tree the root you can't see but the fruit is the place where it's the fruit is being you the blessing is being supplied the root is the source they're dead on both sides they're uprooted and they got no fruit why well they're not not connected Jesus said apart from me you can do nothing abide in me and you'll bear much fruit it's interesting when Jesus came to Jerusalem for the final time he comes to Jerusalem the Bible says he went to a fig tree one morning for breakfast expecting to find something to eat no figs so you remember what he did he cursed the Fig Tree now this is not an example for you to get mad at your peach tree or your orange tree at home okay not Jesus losing his temper remember the Fig Tree is one of the national symbols of the nation of Israel remember what Jesus said about fruit he said I come these three years seeking fruit and there's none in that Parable he also remember when John the Baptist was baptizing and the Pharisees would come out to be baptized he said you brood of vipers you know he's calling him sons of the devil you brood of the serpent who warned you to flee from the Wrath that", "is to come if you're going to go through a ceremony demonstrating repentance what' he say bring forth fruit in repentance and so you know this idea of just going through the motions of a baptism but no change of life is dishonest and so here in our text these false teachers they have no root they're not permanent and they have no life they have no fruit if you will they have no store of blessing and they have no core of life within them Matthew 15 and: 13 Jesus uses this very statement about the false teachers by the way he said this in in reaction to his disciples being concerned that he might have offended some spiritual teachers by what said he said every plant which my heavenly father did not plant shall be rooted up in other words it it'll be rooted up to be demonstrated that it's not the Lord's it's interesting to me that as Believers we are to be the exact opposite of this Psalm 1 and verse3 the person who's blessed of the Lord Psalm one he will be like a tree firmly planted by the streams of water which yields its fruit in its season in other words you've got a root and you've got got a fruit put this down number four Wild Waves that leave behind a Miss in our text it reads like this verse 13 there wild waves of the sea casting up their own shame like foam in the Old Testament passage you want is Isaiah 57 20 Isaiah 57:20 the wicked are like the tossing sea stormy sea it cannot be quiet and its Waters toss up refu in mud now it is true there are times in the Bible where the sea the ocean is a picture of the grace of God the love of God we have songs about that I've got love like an ocean in my soul you know the the love of God is is deeper than and it's true and that's an appropriate analogy why well the Bible says that the Earth is full of the loving kindness of the Lord the word loving kindness is HED it's the equivalent of Grace tender Mercy Mercies in the Old Testament and the Earth actually is full of you know we're 71% of water on this Earth the world was made second Peter from water out of water okay so God uses the ocean to describe his loving kindness how well where does he cast your sins into the depths of the sea you see no one's in history no one's going down there they don't have oxygen to do", "that back then if it's down there it's there forever it's c love covers a multitude of sins however here we're not talking about that we're talking rather about the stormy sea and what happens when it's just going wild and the waves are if you will throwing up stuff that it is dredging Up From the Bottom of the Sea I don't know how many of you are familiar with GP huh that's the Great Pacific Garbage yeah a guy found it in 1997 a captain coming from Hawaii back to California couldn't figure out what it was had no ID studied it it is one of five massive they call them garbage patches out in the ocean this one's twice the Texas plastic manmade Plastics six times more plastic than Plankton damaging our oceans all from in all out in the there's this Vortex that causes through these guers this Gathering of the debris into these huge things that no country is interested in cleaning up no country it would bankrupt any country to try to clean up it's Way Beyond man to even touch this is in the modern world but in the ancient world when a storm would come there'd be junk just whatever anything that the ocean had would throw it up on the seashore a true teacher according to Jesus is like the wise scribe who he said brings out of his treasure things old and things new so a true teacher brings up treasure from the depths of the word the false teacher throws up trash out of his own mind he stands in the Pulpit like a storm he may rant and R but he just leaves behind something that needs to be up put this down number five there are flashes of light that disappear into the night because the sixth description of them is they are wering Stars For Whom the black darkness has been reserved forever wow now Jesus Christ one of his titles he's got many is the bright and Morning Star you know what that is right that's actually a planet it's Venus Venus is what what people call the morning star and it has been used for generations and hundreds of hundreds of years Millennium really for navigation that's who Jesus is but beyond that even Believers in the Book of Daniel 12 at the resurrection will shine like the stars forever and ever false teachers are likened unto wandering Stars meteorites falling stars what we call shooting stars oh they light up the night for a moment for a brief second have you ever been out looking for shooting stars with somebody you go did", "you see that one no where never mind you keep looking over here I don't know that's about how long right yeah it's gone that's exactly what he's saying gone forever into the reservation in the darkness of night you know hell is pictured most people picture it as fire Bible uses that analogy flame is not quenched but it also describes Jesus describes hell as outer Darkness now in our mind is like well how do you get the fire and the Darkness cuz those don't exactly that's right those are physical things to describe something that's spiritual as a place of fire it speaks of torment and pain as a place of outer Darkness it's a place of utter isolation remember Hell is not hell because of how hot it is hell is hell because of how far away God is God is light and in him there is no darkness no none all CS Lewis in his book The Great divorce which is not about divorce it's about hell said hell is basically isolation he describes hell as a drab and gray City with Miles and Miles of abandoned and boarded buildings why because people can't get along with each other in hell so they continue to move further and further away forever Napoleon for example lives on the outskirts of town away from the center and spends his days pacing back and forth in a huge house muttering to himself and assigning blame to everyone but himself for his failed life it's a picture of loneliness Brokenness ego and misery say Pastor Bob I don't understand this doctrine of Hell uh but the scriptures have a lot to say about it Jesus talked about it you need to not be uncomfortable with the fact that God teaches it and you need to understand if you're Christian how grateful you are that he saved you from it Lewis goes on there are only two kinds of people in the end those who say to God thy will be done and those to whom God says in the end thy will be done all that are in Hell choose it without that self-choice there could be no hell no soul that seriously and constantly desires Joy will ever Miss finding them in the Lord is the idea you know though I don't agree with his theology some interesting things about hell that aren't too far from the truth is something that Dante who wrote in the beginning of the 14th century in his Dante's Inferno I'm sure you've heard of it there's an image of the gates of hell and him with Virgil passing into it uh", "that has been painted and up at the top is the Latin phrase that he imagines is over the Gates of Hell which you may not be familiar with the Latin but you're familiar with the English from Pirates Caribbean Abandon All hope all ye who enter here in other words there is no hope of ever leaving this place Dante went on to describe hell in terms that the Bible never gets into the details of and he pictures hell as having various levels of punishment and that may be that there are levels of punishment the Bible does teach that he gets into a lot more specifics but besides this one which are the nine circles of hell that he refers to I want them to see the next one one you guys to see where false teachers are eighth level in other words one of the lowest levels of hell you get only lower if you're Judas or Satan uh in the ninth level point is this the Bible says in James let not many of you become teachers for they will incur the judgment if anyone rejects the invitation to God's salvation which everyone has the right to do if we reject it or neglect the Salvation what we do though biblically is we create our own reservation for damnation God will not save you against your will he won't Force you he'll invite you he'll even send people who will try to compel you to come in isn't that one of the weirdest imageries of all the king's having a banquet you have no right to come you're homeless you're basically your life's dead end in the streets here and somebody's coming to you you say the king wants you to come to his banquet for free he'll provide everything you need I don't want to go oh come on please please come here somebody's begging you to have something you don't deserve at some point God says okay it's up to you they are naturally destructive put this down they are doomed biblically doomed he moves from these analogies from creation to actually use an instance of what we call special or Supernatural Revelation that we only find out about in The Book of Jude look at verse 14 it was about these men he's referring to the false teachers in the church it was about these men that Enoch in the Seventh Generation from Adam prophesied saying behold the Lord came with literally myriads of his holy ones to execute judgment upon all the ungodly and convict them of all their ungodly Deeds which they have done", "in an ungodly way all the harsh things which ungodly Sinners have spoken against him this next section actually records what must be considered the very first prophecy ever given by man the only prophecy that predates this would be God's Own concerning The Serpent and the woman we've talked about Genesis 3:15 but here the really the first prophecy every precedes Moses living back to the Genesis 5 and the story of Enoch now what's interesting and and for some people troubling is that Jude seems to be quoting an apocryphal work a cigal work that was not canonical that means it wasn't inspired the Jews nor Christians ever considered inspired called first Enoch and in first Enoch 1:9 We have basically the same thing that is said here well that does not proed that first Enoch was inspired or telling the truth exus proves the first Enoch 1 n this reference is true don't let that trouble you any more than when Paul says you remember what Jesus said it's more blessed to give than to receive and you can't find it in the gospels you don't go ah he didn't Jesus never said that you go ah Paul knows something that I don't know about Jesus Enoch is an interesting guy on all kinds of levels I love studying Enoch according to this passage Enoch wasn't just a guy who existed and something unique happened to him he was a prophet he spoke the word of God it was known by the Jewish people and no doubt and carried down by Oral uh tradition and then it's being mentioned under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit Jude doesn't say I'm quoting first Enoch he just tells us what happened we know this about Enoch if you're not familiar with his story you're reading the genealogies and it's just so and so beg got so and so and so and so beg got so and so and they lived so you know they had children and then he come to this guy Enoch and everything changes it says Enoch lived and he became a father his son's name was Methuselah it's really hard for me to picture meusel as a baby I picture a baby with a long beard because we all know he lived to be 969 years old the oldest man who ever lived it's like okay but he was a baby at one time 65 years old has a son and then it says he started walking with the the Lord not Methuselah it wasn't walking it in a crib dad Enoch starts walking with the Lord you know sometimes having a", "child will change a person's life man or woman to say you know what I'm now going to have an impact on this new life and what I do what I how I live affects another generation I don't know exactly what happened we don't have much of the story other than he has a son and he decides he's going to start walking with God and he does so for 300 years now people were living to be much older that was still young he's not even on Medicare yet and then the Bible says that he he walked with the Lord and then it doesn't say he died like everybody else it says he walked with God and God took him and then in the New Testament we're told that he had a testimony that was pleasing to the Lord I don't know much about him but man wouldn't you like if that's all anybody knew about you that you walked with the Lord for not 300 years but for whatever you got left and that God was pleased with you see Enoch prophesies of a coming Universal judgment that would have been by the way in his day the flood that's when the universal by the way the flood is a preview of the Eternal judgment Jesus said it'll be as it was in the days of Noah so he's predicting actually something that is a a judgment on all mankind which would have been the flood and ult ultimately according to Jude the final Judgment of God very interesting this man Enoch I I like everything about him but here we are told that not only does nature describe these false teachers but so does if you will God's word that tells us that God is going to judge put this down these false teachers are on a collision course because they ungodly Enoch walked with God he was not for God took him do you know O's a type and a picture of the church before the Judgment comes God takes the one who's Walking with God to Heaven I hope you're that person Enoch walked with God and that man he talked to God and as a result he God the secrets of the Lord are for those who fear Him the Bible says God does nothing but he reveals it to His now the Bible is clear from the first book of the Bible all the way to the last book of the Bible there's a coming day of judgment this is a theme you can't miss if you're honest it's something that Jesus I've shared it", "before as he preaches his gospel message keeps coming back to repent for the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand Paul does all through the New Testament John Peter Jude acts 17 and verse 31 tells us that day is scheduled he says there in Athens when Paul's there God has fixed a day in which he will judge the world in righteousness there's a certain day it's on God's calendar right now through a man that's Jesus whom he has appointed having furnished proof to all men by raising him from the dead talks about these false teachers repeatedly as being among those who are ungodly Romans 1 and ver 18 describes why God is going to come and judge for the wrath of God is revealed from Heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men who suppress the truth in unrighteousness you know Martin Luther would say repeatedly there's only two days on my calendar today and that day today and that day you know what I think I think a lot of Christians give lip judgment it's kind of like they say yeah someday there's going to be a judgment you know what it reminds me of reminds me of the sisters in John 11 at funeral your brother will rise again someday in the great resurrection of Daniel 12 you know no today actually I not am just going to be the I am the resurrection today and I think there are a lot of people who make this mistake do you know one of the signs of false teachers Peter calls him and so does Jude mockers will come in the last days saying where is the promise of his coming the word coming is perusia refers to the second coming but it actually refers also to the Rapture it refers to him coming for his own and judge it's interesting mockers will come saying where is it we keep talking about it I mean how Lindsay wrote about it in the 70s and here I am do you know that 90% of the churches in this world by the way you may not know this a third of this world claims to be Christian 2.2 billion people on planet of those 2. 2 billion 90% do not believe in the Rapture do not believe that's going to happen if you are you you are in a small minority who believe the Rapture is going to happen before mockers are already here saying it's not going to interesting but these false teachers are on a collision course for the Judgment of God ecclesiast es 12:4 if you're familiar with the Book of Ecclesiastes", "you remember the author is Solomon Solomon could be called a sophomore you say what you know maybe I don't want to ask if you're a sophomore in high school or college because that's not fair because of what I'm about to say sophomore soft comes from the Greek word Sophia beautiful name means wise which means well fool sophomore is somebody who has a little knowledge and thinks they're pretty smart so they're a Wise Fool that's Solomon he was the wisest man who ever lived he was also maybe one of the biggest fools who ever lived if you read his life Ecclesiastes is a picture of some of that both in one book because he speaks in that book much about a natural perspective as a man Under the Sun and life is monotonous and it's worthless and it's not fair take it to chapter 12 the last chapter remember your creator in the days of your youth he says here's when it all comes down he says fear God and here's why it's Ecclesiastes 12:14 for God will bring Every Act to judgment everything which is hidden whether it is good or evil Matthew 12 and: 36 Jesus said I say to you every careless word Every Idle word that men shall speak they shall render account for it in the day of judgment you know sometimes people will say why doesn't God do something about all the evil in the world if there's a God why doesn't he do something about all the evil in this world my answer to that is he has it's the cross and he is he's using it if you're a Believer for your good isn't that what Joseph said to his brothers who wanted him dead only kept him alive to make a shekele you meant it for evil God meant it for good and if you believe in Romans 8:28 then you need to know that too all things working together for good he's using it now in our life for our good and ultimately his glory even if we don't understand it not only he did and he is but he will and that is Jesus Christ will come and judge all wickedness listen people sometimes they're getting away with it they got away with it nobody's getting away with anything I like what Billy just say he used to go like this like it was a movie he'd go the cameras have been rolling since the moment everybody was born there is nothing that is escaping God's record books and it will all be brought to judgment you never have to feel like", "you I need to get paid back and don't worry about it remember the story about Moody TRU Story got build for something repeatedly he had already paid for it he sent message back I paid for it check your records we checked you we don't you pay up or we're going to sue you finally he paid it a second time said to be settled at the Rapture you're going to suffer injustices in this life Jesus kept entrusting himself to him who judges righteously when he crucified a newspaper was talking about the Supreme Court one year and they wrote this I love this article it says after a 3-month summer recess the Supreme Court of the United States opened its new term according to the New York Times News service the Court's legal business for that first day could be summed up with one word no the court announced it had refused to hear more than 1,600 cases the names and the docket numbers of the rejected appeals covered 68 typewritten pages for those cases that was the last court of appeal the word the writer says there's something terribly final about judgment the Supreme Court says no and that's it no appeals no arguments the books are sealed the decision is final and the writer was a Christian they said on the great day of judgment there will also be a terrible Crescendo of NOS no you cannot enter my kingdom the doors will be shut forever no appeal no time to change one's mind those who have rejected Jesus will have forever lost opportunity for eternal life but praise God today God is saying yes now is the time for salvation you see Jesus Christ is either going to become your savior now or he will be your judge then and that choice is really up to you to make put this down letter C they are verbally dangerous they are naturally destructive they're biblically doomed but they are verbally dangerous in verse 16 it's all about the mouth which the previous verse ended with God judging their ungodly Sinners who have spoken against 10 but look at verse 16 they are grumblers finding fault following after own lusts so put this down they are faultfinders who are fueled by their grumblers now that's a pretty common sin so we need to be honest here's the characteristic of those God's going to judge and we can fall into that category feeling like that's I'm more like that remember what Paul said uh I think it was to the Church of Philippi he said U do everything without grumbling or", "disputing you remember what he said he goes because if you do that you'll look like lights like stars against the dark of night all you have to do you don't have to share your faith just don't complain like everybody else you'll stand out you'll be an excellent student an excellent you know uh worker probably get the raise cuz people will you'll be different cuz everybody else is is doing that just don't do that you know grumbling comes to us very naturally Bible says out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaks I like the Spurgeon put it he said whatever fills The Well of your soul comes out the bucket of your lips it's way more eloquent than I can do I I just say the tongue is the dipstick of the soul and that's about as close as I can get but the fact is this is what the Bible teaches your mouth reveals what's really going on inside of your heart you can't see inside someone's heart but they're the words they they choose to use many times give you a sense of what's really going on but this issue of complaining of grumbling is common to man by the way it's common to Christians too it's common to people who' have been saved how do I know that because six times the nation of Israel murmers against God who is there with them who's providing for them every day who saved them miraculously six times God has to judge them that's 1 Corinthians 10:10 don't be murmurers Paul says to the church where God has to destroy you like he destroyed them they were faultfinders that also can happen with God's people I don't care how spiritual you are how much Faith you've had doesn't mean you always do remember what God calls job at the end of the book will the fault finder find fault with the almighty and contend with job David was God's example of the king everybody else should be measured against was he Perfect by no means but he was at least humble finally with what even his sin but his son will talk to the men of Israel as they come to get their cases settled try to get their case settled and be frustrated that their case wasn't being settled and he would just weave Rebellion into their hearts by saying you know if I were a King instead of my dad your case would be settled and the Bible says he stole the hearts of the men of Israel oh fault finding and grumbling is utterly contagious you guys be careful who you", "hang around with if you say well actually people need to be careful about hanging around with me okay well open your eyes to it then the flesh is vulture always sinking something rotten to Feast on some people have as their life motto if you don't have anything good to say let's hear be one of those interesting because I think the Bible's pretty clear there are two types of people in the world and some sometimes we're one sometimes we're the other and we need to be careful about this there are fault finders listen to me and there are fruit finders say what what do you mean remember what Jesus said I said it earlier I come these three years seeking fruit he's looking for fruit he doesn't point out the false that's not what he comes to do I didn't come to destroy men but to save them it'd be so easy if you just started pointing people's faults he sees them all he you know we see each others it's just our nature right I was morning this guy got up to pray for the service and he was praying and after the service some guy come and saidou know you made about five grammatical errors in your prayer he said that's okay I wasn't talking to you Jesus is looking for fruit it's amazing where he finds it there's twice in the gospels where he Marvels at faith had Faith Like Jesus but he Marvels at somebody else's Faith one was that Centurion who said you know my servant is sick but Jesus said I'll come he say I'm not worthy for you to come you shouldn't as a Jew go into a gentile's house I'll save you the trouble I know what it's like CU When I give a guy a command man he goes when you give a command it'll happen and he marveled at his Jesus marveled at his faith I haven't seen such faith in all of Israel here's this Gentile who has more faith I want to point out fruit he doesn't really put everybody down he just says this is amazing the sof phenician woman another Pagan not a Jew who begs that her daughter could be healed and won't let Jesus go says I I admit I am that little puppy dog that could just have a chrome I'm not this child that has any right to it but I know you she persists and he Marvels at her faith let me ask it this way when's the the last time you marveled at somebody's faith and told them be a fruit finder everybody sees", "the faults doesn't take any there's no spiritual gift I'm a fault finder I'm got no you bury that Talent finally they are full of themselves full of themselves they flatter to flatten others in verse 16 they follow after their own lusts they arrogantly flattering people but why for the sake of advantage now the Bible tells us there's boldness or confidence and arrogance the righteous are bold as a lion when you're filled with the spirit you'll have confidence and boldness arrogance it's not about you but the flesh is puffed up knowledge puffs up and Believers can think they're all that in a bag of chips someone has said Remember When the peacock struts its stuff he shows his backside to half the world flattery so these people are not only big on themselves they can come across very um well we can like to be around them they say nice things about us this is one of the Temptations now don't misunderstand me I've been misunderstood but I've talked about this before so I don't want anybody coming up to me being offended so don't be offended whatever I'm about to say no kidding I've said before my my favorite person in life isn't usually a Salesman so if you're a salesperson no offense to you it's 99.9% it's not you it's you're you're in that because I just don't like it when somebody's trying to sell me something I don't like to go into a store and him say what can I do for you uh get out of my way would be number one number two is leave me alone the rest of the time I'm here because I really don't like pressure and I don't like somebody telling what who are you looking for what kind of thing would you like one of these how about three of these I'm not because I know their motive is not because they love me okay they want you know that's their job but it's not anyway these false teachers are all about telling you things about you they're not only just big on them they're big on you and that's where it becomes difficult because we like being around people that like us who doesn't somebody said flattery is like perfume enjoy it briefly but never swallow it and remember when someone Pats you on the back make sure they're not trying to get you to cough something up um someone wrote this mean people don't bother me a bit mean people who disguise M As Nice people bother me a whole lot and that's exactly what we we grandchildren sometimes when they drive", "with me and Becky in the car will point out a vehicle they'll say oh there's a van you know do you know white no no windows how many of you have ever heard that before okay how many of you think that when you okay we laugh too but it's like that's of you years ago I was uh flying from LAX to uh the bay area to meet my wife to do some things up there and um I stayed to preach and she went with somebody else my daughter-in-law was up there with her and they had they had driven and I was meeting them there and uh so I I went to LAX early in the morning this is this is uh shortly after 9/11 and uh everybody's concerned about flying at that point you know and there was a lot of stuff going on in our nation having to do with ethnicities and different things and I remember just trying to get there I'm not a I don't love I don't mind flying I just don't like the process of getting ready to get on board the plane it's just nerve-wracking sometimes to have everything I forget anything anyway so I'm traveling I go to LAX this is before the buses and the current parking situation where you have to long-term parking I'm cheap so I park out there and um get on one of those shuttles you know it's one of these big Vans with all kinds of seats and even though it was early in the morning it's still dark and I'm trying to see if I'm going to make my flight and I'm thinking about it and I want to get on and thing's kind of crowded there's a lot of people on it and there's like a seat one seat open right behind the driver you know the second the first seat that you can kind of sit in and there's several more rows of seats that were I thought fold it might have been one in the back and as I as I got in the guy who was the driver says to me get in the back I said what said you're American and I thought what I just just I thought well I don't you I said why can't I said you because because you're American and I thought AR aren't we all he goes no they're they're a tww and they're Delta and American Airlines is at the end of Horseshoe see the problem with profiling whoever you are is that it's really easy to do and it's really easy to get", "wrong when God does it you can trust the details both the motives and the reasons accurate finally put this down and we're done don't be a sin sniffer but become a fruit inspector don't be we're not to go around judging each other condemning each other we're not never to ignore sin when we see it we're to reprove it we're to minister to it and try to restore somebody but we're not to go looking for it but we are commanded in the Bible you will know them by their fruit you will know them you'll you'll understand who they are their character might take a while you might have to run into the reef you might have to bump into them because it won't always be obvious that the Lord is trying to protect us during the times of the end times when they will multiply even Among Us you know what Paul the Apostle said we'll have you know what Paul the Apostle said when he left pastoring the church of Ephesus which he planted and ministered to for three years and he said I'm leaving and I'm never going to see you guys again but I know this after my departure Savage wolves will come among you even men from your own midst the eldership who will arise to draw people after them in other words words it's going to be from within the church that Satan will try to hurt the body of Christ and it's is it's still the case I am grateful for the way the Lord has blessed us as a church for the years that I've had the privilege of being part of this church but I know the enemy is always at work always wanting to work to divide to discourage to damage the witness of the church so the Lord is giving us a warning we feel that's not what I needed today well maybe it's not where you're itching but it's where God's scratching let's all stand and we'll sing together nothing you there's nothing better than you Lord there's nothing nothing is better than you there's nothing better than you this better than you is nothing nothing is better than you you turn gra into God you turn B into all you turn SE into highways you're the only one who you turn great to God you turn BS into Aries you turn SE into Highway you're the only one who P the only one the only one who can you're the only one who you know on on the one hand this passage is all about these false", "teachers and we might feel like well I'm glad I'm not one of them and I sure hope God will protect me but then when we get these the descriptions they feel so close to home grumblers finding fault it's this phrase though I want to leave us with they are following after their lusts the word epithumia lusts can just mean like the NIV translated they live to satisfy their own desires in other words that's just the nature of man there are some people and sometimes even Believers whose motto is I do it my way I've done Memorial Services where people Christians wanted that song played I did it my way and they're so proud of that it's like I don't really get that my question for you as we close today's service is are you living for your pleasure which we all do naturally or are you living for God's pleasure you say what do you mean well in Revelation 4:11 the 24 Elders say this in the book that we'll soon be studying to God you are worthy to receive glory honor and power for you created all things and listen and for your pleasure they were created until you learn to live for God's pleasure and not your own you have not even begun to discover why you're here you were made to live for the glory of God to the glory of his grace actually according to Ephesians so let me ask it this way to everyone and everyone watching are you a fan or are you a follower of Jesus Christ you say I'm a follower good are you a believer or a disciple of Jesus Christ you say well aren't those the same no they're not Jesus said to those who had believed in him if you continue in my word then you are my disciples indeed listen the claim of a Believer is I believe the character of a disciple is how I behave the testimony of a disciple is I used to be in charge of my life but I no longer am is that your testimony because as a youngr Christian for 4 years I was the most miserable Christian that I knew I knew the Lord but I wasn't close to the Lord I wasn't being used of God I had no hunger for his word no desire to pray I went to church and I became desperate and maybe that's not you but maybe it is some of you that says I don't want to live out the rest of my life as a Christian wasting my life I want to live it for", "the glory of God then praise God if you're desperate it's way when you get desperate and are saying I want this life that I've been living to end I want to live the life that God gives me you've got your finger on it you have to die to yourself there must be a death Jesus said except a grain of wheat fall to the Earth and die that seed get buried like a funeral it'll never live again but if it lives again if it's buried and dies it'll bear much fruit if you want to Bear much fruit I got news for you it's not about you or me it's about the vine he can use just like he can speak through donkey he can bear fruit through any of us but you've got to be dead to yourself and Alive God and connected to him and I pray if there's even one person who says you're describing me now Pastor then that's the reason you're here today to say I want to put in my resignation for living this life listen it means giving up your will and that's not easy to do Jesus did it in the garden remember he resigned himself to the father's will even though he didn't want to go to the Cross who could want to be separated from his father he had never known separation in all he eternity of course he didn't want to go it was that he was willing to go are you willing to resign your will to God's and mean it and say God I may not like it I may not even be able to understand it but I am choosing it I am deciding you will be the Lord Of My Life he's ready for that resignation our prayer room is taking him today by the way you're invited may the Lord bless you and keep you may he make his face shine upon you and be gracious unto you may he lift up his countenance upon you and give you peace in the name of the father and the Son and the Holy Spirit", "in his faith and like all of us in this room who know the Lord we make some progress we start walking by faith and God blesses and we're makin altars and we're gods using us you know and then we take maybe two steps backwards and we compromise with the world and we find the consequences the wages of sin still brings rotten fruit what does that old verse say you know that that sin is pleasurable for season was that season always comes to an end it's always shorter than he had hoped and while it's pleasurable for a seasoned man it stinks the rest of the year and so Abram we've been following him and now in chapter 17 after years of silence at least as far as the Bible reports God's not speaking much last time we read about him in chapter 16 he was only 86 now he's 99 thirteen years past don't have much knowledge of anything that happened in between there don't know God speaks out of the blue dimly says it's time here I want to want you to know it's time for you to walk before me be blameless I am gonna bless you I'm gonna bring about my promises that you've been waiting for and of course Hagar has already been pregnant with the baby and he's been born but that wasn't God's plan but put this down would you God gives a new name to fit a new nature a new name to fit a new nature and the first few verses we're gonna study tonight we have four of the I wills of God someone has counted seven someone else 21 and there's just a lot of more God says I will I will I will what a blessing where God starts telling you what he's gonna do he has all these promises the Bible says is great magnificent promises Peter writes that make us partakers of the holy nature God has a promise for every problem you and I are facing right now do you believe that do you know what those promises are for the problem you're facing right that's why we need to know the Word of God this is the insurance policy this is a dia sheron's policy God is a word to speak to you and me about what we're going through right now whatever it is we need to know his promises more so we need to believe them and then we need to wait on him because it gets hard Abraham wasn't bearing children he had the promise he just didn't have the promise fulfilled but Roman says even though he", "counted his body as good a dead as dead he didn't stagger at the promises but he grew strong that's what we need to do you need to say oh Lord I don't know when I don't know how you're gonna fulfill this in my life but I don't doubt I will not let myself begin to doubt that you're gonna do it and when it's time to move God can move quickly God starts saying I will I will I will be it's interesting and I think it's true in just in general we need to remember before God tells you what you're to do he tells you what he's gonna do and by the way that's kind of the makeup of the whole New Testament as you read the epistles of the Apostle Paul he'll tell you repeatedly and every epistle first what God has done for you before he tells you what God wants you to do for him because the fact is you're not gonna be able to do what God wants you to do for him until you appreciate what the Lord Jesus has already done for and so you'll find that in each of the epistles the first chapter the first two or three chapters are usually deep theology about who Christ is and what you or who you are in Christ and then when you get a hold of that where you're seated what he has done for you how you're in the heavenlies with Christ and you're no longer what you used to be now therefore walk worthy of the Lord and he'll give you the practicals you see and so here to God says I will do this I will do this I will do this and then a little bit later you can say now here's what you got to do but first you need to realize what what I'm gonna do now put this now by grace then accept God's new name by faith verse 4 as for me my covenant my promise is with you you will be the father of a multitude of Nations and to go along with that no longer shall your name be called Abram and what does Abram mean the name Abram it means hi Bob a B is is his Hebrew for father like Abba daddy a be his father and and the rest of his name Avram means high or exalted the exalted father now he that was his name I guess his mom and dad gave him that name and of course he got married and lived for years with no children and that must have been odd", "for people when they met him said oh what's your name my name is my father oh great how many kids do you have ha ha ha a little joke you know and so I'm sure that was a hard name to have but God is saying you are going to be not just the father of one that's all you wanted he just wanted to have a an heir an heir of his own that's all you know I love the fact that the Bible said God is able to do exceedingly abundantly beyond all we ask or think I like that verse first Corinthians 2:9 the things that God has for those who love them are beyond what you can see imagine you've never even begun to consider all that God has prepared for you and you think of the best thing that you own cloud I just want a child come a just I just I just want a career that I love I just want someone even love me and I can love God is more to give you than you could ask for yourself it's always better than saying God this is what I want to say God here's what I want but to be honest he just give me what you wanna give me cuz you know best father well so he says in conjunction with the fact that he's going to make him a father of a multitude got to change your name your name will no longer be just exalted father but your name shall be Abraham for I will make you the father of a multitude of Nations so here Abraham is invited to take on a new name but still the promise has not been fulfilled and God may ask you to believe in faith he's gonna do something for you but then he's gonna ask you to make some changes to your life that you're already accepting that he's going to do it before he's done it and people aren't gonna necessarily understand why they're gonna mock you more what will you changing your name yeah don't play me to get rid of that name I father since you don't have any kids what's your name now Oh father of a multitude are you really weird you know what's a man named Juliet asks Romeo in act 2 scene 2 she says after all a rose by any other name would still be a sweet what does it matter that I'm a Capulet you're a Montague they hate each other's guts those names mean nothing other than you know that we names mean nothing but", "the Bible is of a different opinion about names names do matter you probably like a lot of us were brought up when somebody called you a name someone said well sticks and stones they may break your bones but names will never hurt you well God wants to give you a name that I'll heal you wants to heal their hurts in your life will you jot down Isaiah 62 and verse 4 here's what God said to his people never again will you be called the Forsaken City the desolate laminal your name will be called city of God's delight and the bride of God Beulah land for the Lord delights in you and will claim you as his bride the Lord's word to his people who else was given a different name in the Bible when you think of a if the Lord gave a different name anybody think it was somebody who got a different name from the Lord actually can't prove that one because we don't read of Saul every giving a name from the Lord we just know Saul was called Paul 1 is that those are two different languages but we don't have God changing his name yes Jacob what was his new name Israel yeah Yaakov he'll catcher basically ripoff I don't know high spirits let's just call him a little thief no that's the name Jacob one who supplants and but God says no where the angel says your name will be Israel governed by God or prints with God who else got a new name certainly right in this chapter we won't study it tonight but she gets her name changed from Sarai - Sarah the princess yeah Simon Peter given a new name by by Jesus and so what's his new name well in Greek you know it it's Petra all right yeah it's a stone and Jesus says a public speech I'll build my church but here here his name was Simon that's a good biblical name Samanta - here in the Old Testament but there's no I'm going to change your name to Cephas or translated Petrus and a freak and so Jesus gave me anybody else think of somebody who got in a name from the Lord yeah we will how do you every single one of us will be given a new name now I don't know if that means we won't use ours anymore I mean I'm kind of partial to Bob I think it was at a Christmas time and went into the brea mall I was buying something for Becky and you know how the malls are at", "Christmas you get mauled you know and I was in there and I when did this boutique it was just crazy crowded and I bought something I remember something she would like and I'm wanting to have it wrapped because I don't wrap and I do but it's a mistake to even try for me to do it never comes out looking like anything good so I give it to them because they knew what they were doing there's this young girls like you know they they hire for seasonal help you know sixteen seventeen year old girls and there was a bunch up in their room they said well I said can I just leave it cuz you guys are busy I'll do some more shopping I'll come back in a half hour now if they said great they said well what she said what's your name I said my name is Bob and she she wrote it too into it did you say Bob I said I'm thinking because not hard to spell oh I could help you oh anyway and I didn't say I said yeah Bob she goes I thought she was mocking me she was if I ever have a son I'm gonna name him Bob I thought wow that's I gotta tell people cuz I had never had anybody say that to me but um Jesus gave James and John a new name did you know that Bo a nerd geese or sons of thunder I've heard a lot of sermons where people were putting them down walls you know Jesus was being sarcasm funder you know kind of bull girl ball a toilet gob I don't think Jesus did that to people that he loved or anybody else gracious words fell from his lips so my guess is we have something of an encouraging nickname what is thunder represent multiple times in the Bible especially the Old Testament Samuel prayed and God Thunder in the storm be the voice of God and the Psalms and proverbs listen to me I think that Jesus was saying you guys are the ones here again you're the voice of God you're your preachers you see and he was it was absolutely a word of encouragement to them as my guest but I can't prove that I'll get to heaven and ask maybe I'm wrong uh-huh wouldn't be the first time Solomon was given a name most of us don't know his name anybody know Solomon's name that God gave him Jedidiah Jedidiah Jedidiah means beloved of the Lord but we know him as Solomon well in any case Abram is", "gonna get a new name because he's gonna get if you will a new nature a new calling him his life and he's gonna go from exalted father to this beautiful name father of a multitude and God says a multitude of nations are going to come from you and you know you say well how many nations came from Abraham just the Jews right what other nations came from Abraham who yeah there are 22 Arab nations in this world all descended from Ishmael 384 million Arabs in 22 different countries in the Arab League and then there were the sons of keturah who Abraham also married and so we have these tribal people that became nations we have the for instance Jacob's brother a different nation actually one of the enemies of God's people so it's very interesting but they're gonna be many many nations on this earth but if we want to understand the total fulfillment of the fuller picture of the fulfillment as promised it's not just geographical and geopolitical and ethnic in the sense of cultures I want you to jot down Romans chapter 4 verses 9 through 11 Romans 4 9 through 11 Paul says this is this blessing then on the circle sighs door on the uncircumcised also for we say faith was credited to Abraham as well actually God said that how then was it credited while he was circumcised or uncircumcised not while he was there was way before that but while uncircumcised and he received the sign or the badge of circumcision a seal of the righteousness of the faith which he had while uncircumcised remember when he went out looked at the stars so that he might be listen now the father of all who believe without being circumcised that righteousness might be credited to them and the father of the circumcision that is the Jews to those who not only who are of the circumcision physically but who also follow in the steps of the faith of our father Abraham which he had while uncircumcised so Abraham is the father of a multitude and fathers of Nations or people groups not just because of his descendants but he's the father of all who believe how many of you here are not Jewish but you're a Christian raise your hand guess what you can sing that song father Abraham and many sons or daughters because we are according to the Bible children of Abraham in that he believed God he was not circumcised when he did this initially he believed God and God called him righteous and so Paul says he is a father not genetically spiritually every", "person in this room who ever by faith not being Jewish nothing to do a circumcision believed God and was made righteous jot down Romans 4 16 and 17 for this reason it is by faith in order that it might be in accordance with grace so that the promise will be guaranteed to all the descendants not only to those who are of the law that is the Jews but also to those who are the faith of Abraham who is the father of us all as it is written a father of many nations have I made you in the presence of him whom he believed even God who gives life to the dead and calls him to being that which did exist so we have this great promise that is to Abraham but it is far beyond the physical nations that came from him and then of course you have Jesus saying there in Matthew 28 make disciples of all the yea the toff nay we call them ethnicities make disciples and then in revelation 5:9 you have those four living creatures falling down with the twenty-four elders and they say to the lamb who has overcome laughs the Lion of the tribe of Judah who is the lamb that was slaughtered you are worthy to open the scroll you've redeemed the earth you redeemed us by your blood and men from every tribe and every nation and so there are people all over this planet who can say Abraham is my father in every language that you can imagine because they've come to faith in Jesus Christ you see and that's where the ultimate fulfillment of this is now it's interesting both with Abram and with Sarai later in this chapter of their names are changed it has changed by adding one Hebrew letter the letter is the fifth letter of the Hebrew alphabet Aleph beta mode elf hey hey and that fifth letter interesting Lee is spoken of by the rabbi's as being a reference to the breath of God it's used in the creation narrative multiple times a mate associated with the breath of God or the presence of God being added to his name it's also interesting because the number five is in what's known as gyum Maitreya the study of the meaning of numbers it symbolizes God's grace and His goodness and his favor toward humans by the way somebody has noted it's used 318 times in Scripture and that's an interesting an interesting number because we read that Abram took his trained forces from home 318 remember and he rescued luck which was a miracle but fascinating", "there in Genesis 14 14 anyway so we have this interesting way God chooses to put grace into his name give him a promise of posterity that's gonna be a multitude now put this down number to see God's promise of graced extends in perpetuity verse seven I will establish my covenant between me and you and your seed after you throughout their generations so it's not just with Abraham for an everlasting covenant to be God to you and to your descendants after you I will give to you and to your descendants after you the land of your sojournings all the land of canaan notice this for an ever let you might want to underline it for an everlasting possession and I will be their God when we moved into this building they used to build satellites in here right where you're sitting satellites right there and the company that was before us and big factory basically and so they have parking for 120 and we said well we'd like to build a church well how many people well we'd like to have a thousand seats when we first moved in because we needed more seats and they said yeah okay well to have that many seats you need a lot more parking than 120 and we said well there's a lot of parking spaces out here and they're all closed on Sunday and they said yeah right now some one of these people sells their property and opens it to somebody else and their employees have to be here where are your people gonna go they go you got to figure that out because we're not gonna let you use this building as a church unless you get a parking agreement with all the other tenants in this complex I said so if they say it's okay it's okay they said oh no they have to put that in writing in a legal document that even if they sell their property ever 50 years from now the new owners will honor that parking agreement I go why would they ever want to do that to their property it's not going to make it a saleable some of these people are trying to sell their property right now there's tenants and some of them and owners and they did that happen here that they said you do that or you don't get the property in perpetuity were the exact words forever well the Lord has ways and God was God blessed us because the people that were selling us the property owned the other buildings and so they got motivated to sign the document that nobody else in", "their right mind whatever sign and God gave us the building and this is what God is saying I'm making an agreement with you Abram to give you this land but not just you it's for you and your children and as many as are far off as people say about the coming of the holy 3 it's for everybody of your descendants from now on there are those who claim oh you know the land of Canaan or some call it Palestine which is a huge mistake to ever call it Palestine or what we call the nation of Israel that narrow stretch of land there on the eastern side of the Mediterranean that we're gonna go visit in March that that particular land was given to Abram and his descendants but then lost when the children of Israel or rather when Israel rejected God and were banished - in 70 AD when the Romans came in and destroyed Jerusalem there are those who say that was it they were kicked out and they claimed that's even what Jesus said that this land this temple would be given to another nation that would bear the fruit of it so they interpreted the Bible is saying God gave the promise but really they didn't fulfill their end of the bargain so they lost it in fact they say the church is inherited it's just a spiritual promise now can I tell you something this verse in black and white tells you otherwise God is he does not take back what he gives the calling of God and the gifts of God are irrevocable the Bible says and so the promises to them and and then to their grandchildren and on and on and on throughout history and here's the truth for us that we got to realize if God has made us promises and he has he's made a covenant the new covenant would call it then we need to realize that God is going to treat us in the same way that he's treated his people if he's kept his promises literally to them he'll keep his promises literally to us if it's an unconditional promise which it was was based on who he was rather than how faithful they'd be how glad I am that he does that for me and you and though we're faithless he's faithful because he can't deny himself you see and so we have that wonderful everlasting promise of God to Abram and in perpetuity to his descendants nope down there in verse 8 look at it again he said I'll give to you and to your", "seed after you the land of your sojournings in other words everywhere that he walked all the land of canaan for an everlasting position and I'll be you know I will talk more about this as we get into the book of Deuteronomy that's about 10 years from now at the rate I'm going but God says I'm gonna give you the land of your what what's the word sojourning we don't use that word much you're traveling in other words I'll give you where you go everywhere the sole of your foot treads Joyce and here's the principle when it comes to the promises and the gifts of God I want to give you this but you've gotta walk in it you can't just get a deed the promised land on a map it's all walk it live it all the promises of God are great that he's made but you're gonna have to actually go by faith and experiment with it live in it everything everywhere your foot goes it's yours but some of us have a very narrow small Christian experience with a huge reservoir of blessings that God wants to give but we've never walked in it and maybe this year for some of us God's saying it's time it's time to start walking and some of the things you've seen other people living out or you've read about or you've wished for it's time to start sojourning and the promises of God well put this down letter beep God calls for a response to his promises in verses 9 through 14 we see what we called the sign of a circumcision what's called in the New Testament the seal of righteousness take a look at the text verse 9 God said further to Abram Abraham now now as for you you shall keep my covenant you and your descendants after you throughout your generations and this is the covenant which you shall keep here's your end of the bargain every male among you shall be circumcised by the way can I tell you something this is not a new invention circumcision in other words it was like nobody had ever heard of this before oh no the Egyptian priests practice circumcision people of certain parts of the land not all the ancient peoples but there were other peoples who practiced it including their inching but it's gonna have a completely unique and different meaning they would circumcise by the way and the Ishmaelites and their descendants which is later at about the age of 13 is when they do it even to this day circumcising an 8 days that's something uniquely Jewish but other", "priestly groups and other ethnicities did practice it some of them but God saying complete new meaning and I think of Jesus taking the bread after the Passover and taking the cup the third cup something that they did every year and had done forever remembering Passover and what did he say this this Cup hey this I mean I know what you think this means let me tell you what it represents for you from now brand-new meaning you know you you celebrate Thanksgiving and maybe you think of the Pilgrims and the Indians or in bottle maybe think of creamed corn I don't know about you you know we have certain traditions that we associate with it a completely different meaning than you've ever thought of before that's what Jesus did in the Upper Room and that we take that for granted because we have only learned communion that way but what's happening with circumcision here is it's not some new right that no one never enough it's not practiced by most people in the world at this time but it wasn't completely unknown but it's going to be given a very unique meaning between God and his people and he says every male among you verse 10 shall be circumcised they knew what that meant and you shall be circumcised in the flesh of your foreskin it shall be a sign of the covenant between me and you circumcision an outward visible can be seen in if you're not dressed I guess an outward visible sign of an inward invisible relationship by the way it didn't grant you any special privileges with God it is a badge of something that was already true the corresponding Rite or sacrament in the New Testament is what - circumcision baptism an outward visible sign of an inward invisible relationship of something that's already true baptism doesn't save anybody and neither did circumcision but it shows if you have faith that you're in that covenant relationship some things that I want you to put down to remember about circumcision first of all it's a permanent separation to God obviously you get circumcised it's for life it's not something that can be undone I often talk to people who feel like they've lost their salvation and I remind them that God uses terms like you must be so if yeah I've been born again but maybe I need to be born again again you know well the good news is once you're born into a family you can't be unborn see people get this mixed up sometimes Christians do well I know but I've really been blowing it what if you know", "I'm just not really saved or if I lost fellowship with God can be lost in terms of your experience and your behavior relationship with God that's based on regeneration his birth cannot be lost I have three sons it does not matter at all how they act toward me what they believe how mean they are to me they're very nice to me but if they were mean to how disrespectful where they live they would be my sons for the rest of their they cannot undo their sonship can't lose it what she'll separates from the love of God you nothing you were gonna be his child when you become his child you're permanently his child can't undo circumcision can't undo big mourning yet now when it comes to fellowship a whole different deal behavior decisions obedience all of those things affect fellowship that's why first John 1:9 says if we confess our sins he's faithful and righteous to forgive us our sins and cleanse us we need to be restored to relationship in terms of fellowship I should say but the relationship the basically cannot be lost okay so you want to distinguish that so we see that in circumcision permanent separation of God secondly it's a personal separation to God between me and you God says from now on there's gonna be a sensitivity and a purity in an area you had not known previously even in the most private areas of your life this is a change in our relationship there's going to be a separation between you and me a consecration to me and even in the areas nobody else knows about that you nothing that's so private so sever that is not governed by me instead of part by man affected by our relationship thirdly it is a pervasive separation - God put in the word pervasive look at verse 12 following every male among you who's eight years old shall be circumcised throughout your generations in other words a week after they're born eight days a servant who is born in your house or who is bought with money from any foreigner you know they don't have to be Jewish no matter who isn't even not one of your descendants they're all to be circumcised and then he says the conditions if somebody refuses if a servant who was born in your house or who's bought is not circumcised chooses not to be rebelled let shall my covenant they will be cut off he says in verse 14 if they refuse but everyone who has bought or born in the house was to be circumcised and here's the idea this", "consecration to God isn't just it is private but it extends on me to everyone in my home it affects them that they also are to come into that relationship with the Lord even foreigners every servant born in my home every one bought with money in other words everything that's yours or mine is affected by this dedication in other words I'm saying God I'm dedicated to you and separated to you but everything I own every relationship I have as far as I'm concerned is also dedicated to you put this down finally a number four it's a picture of a radical separation onto God now we think of the physical Rite of circumcision and it's kind of it's like wow that's radical these guys that were all circumcised this entire is a big several hundred people several hundred men that were all circumcised in the same day but even in the Old Testament the deeper significance of circumcision is taught I want you to jot down a few verses Deuteronomy 10 and Deuteronomy 10 16 God says so circumcise these are to those who understood physical circumcision sighs your heart and stiffen your neck no longer shot-down Jeremiah 9 verses 25 and 26 behold the days are coming declares the Lord that I will punish all who are circumcised that's Jews and yet uncircumcised Egypt and Judah and Edom and the sons of Ammon and Moab and all those inhabiting the desert who clip the hair on their temples for all the nations these are the peoples of the world of goinging are uncircumcised and all the house of Israel is uncircumcised in heart and so the idea of God is saying it's not about this physical right it's all about what it represents which is a deeper issue that people can't see so let's jot down a couple verse from the New Testament help us to understand how it plays out in our lives Romans chapter 2 verses 28 and 29 Paul he is a Jew he is not a Jew who is one outwardly nor is circumcision that which is outward in the flesh and there was that's not the real meaning of it but he is a Jew who is one inwardly and circumcision is that which is of the heart by the spirit not by the letter his praise is not from men but from God and then Colossians 2 verses 11 and 12 brings it to us in Christ we were circumcised with a circumcision made without hands spiritual circumcision in the removal of the body of the flesh by the circumcision of Christ having been", "buried with Christ in Baptism see the relationship between circumcision the Old Testament baptism of the new having been buried with Christ in Baptism in which you were also raised up with him through faith in the working of God who raised him from the dead so a Christian biblically I'm career man oh what a source God's concern has been circumsized in heart we've been circumcised in Christ so the idea is that of the removal of the flesh you see I'm not gonna be living under the the power of the flesh in my life anymore put this down realize it's time to cut off the flesh this is the idea the fleshly life the godless life the appetites of the body that tempt me to sin against God shut down Matthew 5:30 you remember what Jesus said he said if your right hand makes you stumble do what cut it off sounds a little like circumcision there throw it from you for it is better for you to lose one of the parts of your body than for your whole body to go into hell now Jesus some believe what he says that is is actually being sarcastic he really doesn't expect you to go cut off your hair or your eye obviously right he's being he's exaggerating but he's being sarcastic because his ideas that won't help you to stop sinning if you cut off your hand you've got another one right you know you'll get a prosthetic and you'll use that wrongly yeah I mean the fact is the problem you know there was a pastor who had a clock like I have a clock in that room we can't seem to get it fixed it's just it's just not working half the defects they didn't fix with him maybe it's not a battery but anyway it's just wrong I was looking at it before we came in here what one o'clock and maybe I'll do what this pastor did he had a clock and instead of I don't think couldn't fix it or what was wrong with it but he just put a sign on it on the clock and the sign said this it said is like the clock was talking except don't blame my hands the problem lies deeper and that's what Jesus says it's not what goes into a man's mouth that defiles and it's not what you eat it's not an eating with unwashed hands you know that's what comes out of your heart that's what fornication comes from that's where adultery comes from that's where hatred that's where strife that's where murders come from it's a heart", "issue you see and so God's saying I want you to get to the heart of it cutting out for him won't stop you from sinning because it's it's deeper than that it's time to cut off the flesh it's interesting why the eighth day now there are an in Malta to actually I'm gonna read you a couple of reasons why God chose the eighth day that the rabbi's give you know it's been said where you have two rabbis you have three opinions the Talmud tells us that while the baby is in the mother's womb listen to this while the baby is in the mother's womb he has taught the entire Torah as he enters into the world an angel causes him to forget all that he learned based on this some explain that we wait eight days for the circumcision since in the first seven days the soul is mourning its loss Wow definitely have the gift of being creative that's what I said in terms of the purpose of circle according to the Jewish tradition Adam the first man was born without a foreskin just give me a Jewish tradition I know it's more than you want it only when he sinned did he create a barrier between himself and God and at that point developed a foreskin the removal this is Jewish tradition you guys I'm sorry the removal of the foreskin represents the physical act by which man attempts to come close to God again the evil Roman ruler Turnus rufus asked rabbi akiva why Jews performed circumcision he said if God one in men's circumcised would II have not created them that way rabbi akiva answered that God provided circumcision as an act for man to improve himself something even God cannot do for him interesting theology by the way one of the regular rabbinic meanings and even evangelical scholars kindly daily put this in the commentary I say that the rabbi's believed that it's on the eighth date so that the child will have already experienced at least one Sabbath that's right they believe that once the baby has experienced the holiness of the Sabbath he may enter into the Covenant of the Jewish people so that's another frankly the Jews don't know and they when they he actually get aa saying we really don't know could be any of these reasons there is a biological reason that some have suggested that may have something to do with that God obviously knows our bodies better than doctors do but on the eighth day the day that God Commandments circumcision interesting the amount of pro thumb been present in", "the baby's blood is above 100 percent of it's the only day in a male's life in which this will normally be the case therefore the eighth day is the perfect day to do a circumcision when the vitamin K and prothrombin levels are at their peak for coagulation okay well I think that's pretty that's true whether that was the reason God gave at the eighth day a new beginning there's all kinds of different ideas here but we don't know why we just know that there was a time and let's let's not worry about why there was a time let's just get the principle there's a time for the flesh to be cut off right see when you're baptized you're saying the same thing it's time to die I remind people when we do a baptism you've come to a funeral maybe people think they were coming to us special ceremony to be happy it is a time to be happy it's the funeral you should be happy about it's your funeral when you're baptized you're saying I am dead to the old life that I used to live and by the way the Bible tell that we are to start our relationship with or not someday achieve this but we're to start our relationship with Lord this way if anyone wishes to come after me let him do what was it denying yourself that doesn't come naturally take up your cross and Luke says Jesus said we do that how often daily Oh movie where a guy things an Indian chief says this is a good day to die during a bout it was a good day to die I always remember that when I wake up you know what said Lord for anything else this is gonna be a good day to die I want to live dead to myself today you have to choose to die if anyone wishes to come after me deny yourself take up your cross daily and now you can follow me I want you to jot down first Peter for verses 1 & 2 it's the last verse but it's an important one two verses therefore since Christ has suffered in any translation that has footnotes will tell you the words suffered here means suffer death literally suffer death so let's add that therefore since Christ has suffered death in the flesh arm yourself Peter says also with the same purpose because listen now he who has suffered death in the flesh has ceased from sin so as to live the rest of the time in the flesh no longer for the", "lusts of men but for the will of God we'd all agreed that when you are dead you stop sinning we'd write my father in law just went to heaven 1st of January and we were praying God's will for that and we're thankful that God took him it had been a battle for a long time and you know for months as he was dying we weren't sure he was dying we thought maybe he was gonna come back but he was dying and finally toward the end we realized he's dying let's stop trying it because when people are dying one of the common mistakes believe it or not you can read about this common mistakes is that people try to feed people that are dying and because they want them to get better right and they want them to be happy and we don't like to eat right so we think that's what they need well Dyanne guess what they lose for their appetite they do not want to eat and as he got closer closer he he would I don't want to eat it makes me so I don't have any appetite then he didn't want to drink it we got drink you'll die yes that's exactly what I'm doing right now let's put those who are dead don't have to go on diets they have zero appetite to feed their flesh none Peter says that's it you live like that if you're living Paul says in Romans 8 according to the flesh you will die that's verse 14 you'll be cut off but if by the Spirit we put to death the deeds of the body will then you and I are to live as dead to our old nature dead door old pleasures dead to those things Paul says I am crucified with Christ nevertheless I live yet not i Christ lives in me the life which I now live I live by faith in the Son of God who loved me and delivered himself up for me let's pray father circumcision isn't some Jewish thing for men in the Old Testament because we are children of Abraham every one of us who believes we're part of the nation's we're part of the kingdom actually because you said Kings would come from him and in Revelation you said we're kings and priests Lord we're part of the fulfillment of Genesis 17 you're still fulfilling this promise multitudes and millions and millions of people who have the same faith that Abraham had him was declared righteous when he had done nothing the Lord we want to do with this covenant meant what our baptisms meant", "Lord we want to be dead to the flesh we want it cut off we want it removed and so Lord we're asking now thank you for what you already did on the cross we can't achieve what you did but we can believe that you did and with your help by your spirit we can live dead to our whole nature until you give us a new and Lord so help us to do what Paul said and buff at our bodies make it our slaves lest after having preached to others we should be a castaway lord give us the Grace and the strength to say no and to know that we are not slaves anymore except of the Lord Christ it's in his name we pray amen let's all stand the thing together", "with you I was telling you these things Lord as we talk about prophetic things as we talk about future things Lord we know that there are things that we need to learn about them that will help us to live for you today and I pray that you would take away the distraction take away the fears that we walked into the room with about things that are happening or not happening the things that are gonna happen this week just give us peace Lord we want to be in your presence where your sheep and you are present and your rod and your staff they comfort us Lord we don't then be afraid even in the presence of the enemy we're gonna be fed so blass and teach i pray in jesus name amen you can be seated and before I get into the scriptures can I just say something to us it's not it's not part of my teaching it's just on my heart you know we often I think every a good job of welcoming them but may I say how grateful I am for those of you who are not our visitors today I do not take it for granted that you're here now can I tell you something I want you to know my heart for you I want you to be here you know that but I want you to do more than be here I want you to belong here and know that you belong here you see the Bible teaches us we are members of the body of Christ and it's important that you feel like this is where I belong this is my church this is his church and and I'm part of the body part part of the Bride and I hope and pray if that's not your experience it becomes your experience I want to know you myself it would just take a little while if we tried to do all that in one day but my goal and my prayer is that I get to know every one of you better and that our pastoral staff does that but in our Bibles we're gonna study a little bit about this church remember if you haven't been with us a little background Paul plants the churches in the book of Acts and the Gentiles start believing the Jews start persecuting which was normal that's how it went and within three weeks he has to leave because the persecution is so bad in Thessalonica and so he isn't sure really did that did the church really take are they really walking with the Lord", "because we know persecution can cause people to fall away probably some of you in this room have witnessed to somebody seed someone pray a prayer go forward and walk with the Lord or at least it appeared to for a while and then things happened I remember I led the first guy I led to the Lord his name was bud yeah and I led my friend bud to Christ and I prayed with him I was so excited I never prayed with anybody to receive the Lord but as soon as he tried to live out his faith on our high school campus people started making fun of him and immediately he decided he didn't want anything to do with Christianity bud was abroad no moat and it would you just walked away from the Lord and and the Bible says that so Paul's concerned these people have received Christ there in Thessalonica preach the gospel but are they really saved and so he writes first Thessalonians to them to find out really and to encourage them not to find out but he's already been told they're doing well in their faith so he writes first Thessalonians to encourage and commend them about their faith and also to encourage them how to with the Lord in practical purity he writes second Thessalonians because of a concern that has come up since he wrote first Thessalonians concerning false doctrine and false teaching that he's heard about is spreading in the church a little different first Thessalonians to commend them and to tell them really about the rapture second Thessalonians to correct some problems and actually to focus on the second coming of Christ so it's important you know those distinctions now I don't know about you I a lot of us have been brought up with prophecy how Lindsay and Chuck Smith and on and on and I hope many of you are subscribed to a mears a blog behold Israel how many of you already subscribed to that free I encourage you to do so he gives nearly daily but at least once a week some kind update on what's going on in the world and I think as Christians we need to know what's happening in the world with regard to prophecy I highly encourage you to be aware more aware of studying these things and so that you're not uninformed but may I say something to you uh that's really important as you learn about and get excited about the last days the purpose of Bible prophecy is not to kind of make our calendars the purpose of Bible prophecy is to build", "our character you see it's easy to get very excited about last times things but not have it really affect us at all as far as the way we live day to day do you remember in Acts chapter 1 when Jesus risen from the dead was talking to his disciples about the kingdom remember before he went to heaven for those forty days he's talking to them about the things of the kingdom and they were sure well it's about to happen you rose from the dead you fulfilled the Old Testament prophecies we know your Messiah now the next thing is the kingdom of God and so they said is it at this time you're gonna restore the kingdom to Israel and he said to them in acts 1:8 it's not for you to know the times or the seasons which the father has fixed by his own authority but you shall receive power when the Holy Spirit has come upon you and you will be my witnesses Jerusalem Judea Samaria the remotest parts of the earth in other words it's easy to get focused on the wrong thing even as we're excited about prophecy and realize that prophetic studies should cause us to live differently right now today so keep that in mind put this down letter a this is basically the message to those in Thessalonica and I think too many Christians maybe in this room stop if you are being shaken and stirred put in the words shaken and stirred please look at the text again first two verses now we request you brethren with regard to the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ which should excite them and our gathering together to him that's the rapture by the way that you not be quickly shaken from your composure or be disturbed either by a spirit a message or a letter from us to the effect that the day of the Lord has come he said my hands are shaky my knees are weak I can't seem to stand on my own two feet I'm all shook up yeah that was Elvis Presley he said he was all shook up because he was in love but the fact is the church at Thessalonica was all shook up because of a lie because of their misunderstanding of biblical truth can I tell you something Satan's goal is to prevent you from correctly understanding the Bible he doesn't really care if you study the Bible so long as you don't really understand the Bible because he knows if you don't really understand it then you can't believe it correctly and he his", "desire is to pervert your understanding of Scripture put this down don't be confused about God's Word don't be confused you know this was an issue for the Sadducees in the Gospels you remember Jesus's biggest enemies and the Gospels were two groups the Sadducees and the Pharisees and I think sometimes we just go yeah those were the bad guys well they were people that hated each other by the way the Sadducees were the Liberals of their day and the Pharisees were the conservatives and had Twain didn't meet except in their hatred for Jesus the Sadducees were by the way the ones who ran the temple the fair these did not they were together in the Sanhedrin but not in the running of the temple the Sadducees were liberal they were rich and they had power with the Romans but it's the Sadducees you remember who did not believe all of the Old Testament they only accepted the writings of Moses and because they only believed in Genesis Exodus Leviticus numbers and Deuteronomy they said there is no such thing as angels there is there's no such thing as life after death because Moses didn't mention it so we don't believe it doesn't matter who else talks about like Daniel talks about resurrection we don't believe in that so it's interesting when Jesus is talking to the Sadducees what he says he says you do err because you do not know the scriptures that was a little slap in the face because they would have claimed they knew him you know neither the Scriptures nor the power of God and by the way Jesus took time to prove life after death to them from the first five books of the Bible remember they only believed in Genesis Exodus Leviticus numbers and Deuteronomy so he takes him to Exodus 3 one of the ones that they accepted when God introduced himself to Moses at the burning bush and he said to Moses I am the God of Abraham Isaac and Jacob not I was there long dead but I still am right now and Jesus says he's not the god of the dead he's the god of the living they're still alive wouldn't God and he proves it to him from their own Bible they don't receive it of course but the Sadducees did not understand or believe all of the scriptures I think of the two men really disciples of Jesus followers of Jesus up until the time he was crucified who although he's risen from the dead don't know he's alive from the dead members recorded in Luke 24 they're on", "the road to Emmaus and they're bummed out remember you know the story Jesus comes up they don't recognize him he's walking with them and remember what jesus said to them you slow of heart to believe listen to me all that the prophets have written about the Messiah in other words you only believe the part that the Messiah is going to come and cause Israel to be the head and not the tail to establish his kingdom you read that part but you ignore the other part unless I had to die and suffer in order to enter into his kingdom in other words you don't read Isaiah 53 you don't read Daniel 9 where it says the Messiah will be cut off there right there in your Bible but you were ignoring part of your Bible and as a result you're not even aware of what God is doing right now you know the fact is the Jews even the religious Jews believed that Messiah was coming but what they did not detect in the prophecies with was that there were two comings a first and a second can I tell you there are a lot of Christians today who I believe when it comes to the rapture and the Second Coming are doing the exact same thing they only think there's one coming and the rapture is part of the second coming they are missing what the Bible clearly teaches you know the devil is not afraid to use the Bible can I say from the very beginning we see that by the way did you know that Jesus was tempted by the devil with the Bible yeah Satan quotes the psalm so how many one for him to throw himself down from the pinnacle of the temple saying hey it says right in the Bible that he God will give his angels charge concerning you lest you dash your foot against a stone go and throw yourself he tries to attempt the Bible with the office that's crazy Jesus wrote it didn't work but oh he's not afraid to use the Bible on you by the way how did he tempt Eve with the Word of God just slightly twisted hath God not said that's how Satan began this temptation but st. will always put a question mark where God will put a period when it comes to his work so Satan wants to mess with us in terms of our understanding why because you see he knows that if he can rob you of your understanding and faith in the actual Word of God he can take away your", "confidence and your peace exactly what happened here there was fear and confusion can I tell you something it is possible and I've seen a lot of it done it's possible to prove just about anything from the Bible you can prove just about anything you want to from the Bible and many have liked that couple you know the man said I am the only one who makes coffee in this family it's you know you laugh but that I've heard far worse things tried to be proved some of your wives are going that works for me honey it's your job any text taken out of context can be used as a pretext for error that's why our Wednesday night program is called Awana a workman who doesn't need to be ashamed paul wrote to a young pastor timothy with these words study that's king james it doesn't actually mean to study like you do when you're doing homework be diligent is the better translation to prove yourself a workman who doesn't need to be ashamed rightly dividing the word of truth in other words be a person who knows your bible well enough and accurately enough to apply it and interpret it correctly otherwise you're gonna wind up in error jot down john 21 verses 22 and 23 this is after Jesus has risen from the dead it's it's the last chapter of John and he's recording what Jesus said to Peter and about himself in a prophecy that Jesus gave remember I just the background on this Jesus told Peter when you were young you used to clothe yourself and go wherever you wanted to but when you're old it won't be that way other people will gird you and they'll take you where you don't want to go and John says right in the text this was about how Peter was gonna glorify the Lord and die Peter died as a martyr under Nero John writes his gospel later looking back he is now writing that Jesus was prophesying that Peter would die a martyr's death but he also recorded this so Peter seeing John said to Jesus Lord and what about this man you're telling me about my future what about John and Jesus said to him if I want him to remain until I come what is that to you you follow me please notice therefore this saying went out among the that that disciple John would not die yet Jesus did not say to him that he would not die but only if I want him to remain until I come what is that to you", "listen even the true Word of God what Jesus said was misinterpreted aur\u00e9lie by people who didn't understand what he meant even during the gospel times jot down second Peter 3 and verse 16 Peter talking about the last days and the patience of the Lord I was not willing that any would perish but that would all would come to repentance he says in regard the patience of our Lord as salvation just as also our beloved brother Paul according to the wisdom given to him wrote to you as also in all of his letters speaking in them of these things the return of Christ in which are some things hard to understand Peter says which the untaught and the unstable distort the word distort in Greek means to twist it's actually used of the word to torture they twist as they do the rest of the scriptures to their own destruction very interesting by the way it's fascinating it for a number of reasons one it's a place where Peter calls Paul's writings Scripture the inspiration of Scripture is kind of interestingly mentioned and supported by Peter even Anne's writings about Paul right there what he calls the rest of Scripture but in any case you see the point the on top the unstable distort the scriptures always to our own destruction put this down know that your tribulation because you're going through your own know that your tribulation isn't the tribulation and that was the problem here verse 2 he says that you not be quickly shaken from your composure or be disturbed either by a spirit or a message or a letter what that the day of the Lord has come so that Christians in Thessalonica are going through heavy persecution and somehow they had begun to think hey we are in the midst of the Great Tribulation and pulses not so jot down Luke 21 verses 7 through 9 talking about Christ's teaching concerning the last days they questioned Jesus and said teacher when therefore will these things happen and what will be the sign when these things are about to take place he said see to it that you're not misled for many will come in my name saying I am he and the time is near do not go after them when you hear of wars and disturbances do not be terrified for must take place first but the end does not follow immediately let me just paraphrase what Jesus said don't be fooled and don't be frightened do you know that the two big guns the devil has in your life as a Christian are fear and falses remember what Jesus", "said in John 8 he is the father of lies he is really really good at lying the Bible says God has not given us a spirit of fear so what that means is this if you've got one you better consider the source let me say that again God has not given us a spirit of fear so if you've got a spirit of fear it's not from the Lord and we know who it's coming you know in James James talks about wisdom from God but he says that's not the only source of wisdom he says there's a wisdom that's from above and there's a wisdom that's from below you might say there's wise and there's other wise the wisdom from above is peaceable brings peace yielding it's the fruit of the Spirit but the peace that's from below is earthly natural and demonic and it brings confusion and strife and every evil thing well this church is struggling with fear that they're in the middle or starting into the Great Tribulation and as a result of that they are terrified so again spirit of fear I consider the source but also we should consider and comprehend the solutions how do you overcome fear and the Bible fear is overcome by the person of God the presence of God and the precepts of God you say what do you mean by that the person Oh God he will keep the in perfect peace whose mind is stayed on the isaiah writes the presence of god what did David say yea though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death I'll fear no evil for he's with me I'm in his presence you see and then the precepts the law the Word of God great peace have they which love dylon nothing offend them the psalmist said so Paul says whether by a spirit you've come to this conclusion what does he mean that would have been a false prophecy that was given in one of the meetings or a word which would have been a false teaching by somebody that got up to teach or even a letter purportedly as being from us this would have been a forged letter and so it's possible somebody actually wrote a letter claim that it was from Paul or his missionary team and they were reading or something that I heard them say you know that we're in the great tribulation the day of the Lord has come some of you have gotten a call from the IRS some of you are wondering why other people are laughing I'll have good news for you", "they're not going to call you so they're calling it you can just hang up on them or witness to them they'll hang up on you but the fact is it's kind of like that pulsing if you're getting a word from someone it's not us that's not what we are teaching that you're in the great tribulation that the day of the Lord has come uh uh that's why at the end of this book he'll say see with what large letters I'm writing I'm written with my Paul is saying I'm gonna authenticate my message to you I would never have written to you something different than what I've told you about Christ's return now it's an interesting thing the Bible tells us that after Paul was basically kicked out of Thessalonica because the persecution his next stop was Berea Paul went from Thessalonica to Berea sharing the gospel then to Athens and then finally to Corinth and it's in Corinth that he's writing these letters but what a difference the response of the Jews the the response of the Jews was very different in festival in ICANN than it was in Berea quite normally what happened with us that's what Micah happen everywhere else the Jews revolted against Paul as he went to the synagogue and he preached that Jesus was the Messiah and there was a riot usually a riot and a revival that's usually what happened but while the Jews in Thessalonica hated Paul wanted to kill the Jews actually in the synagogue in Berea did not when they heard Paul preach that Jesus is our Messiah and he would show them that from their Old Testament Scriptures the Jewish people actually went home and they open their Bibles the Bible says they examined everything that Paul said they scrutinized it by the scriptures to see if the things he was saying were true and so there was a great response that's why the Bible says that the Jews not the Gentiles but the Jews in Berea were more noble than the Thessalonians because they examined the things that he had said we are told to examine everything by the way this is what Paul did say to the church at Thessalonica and four settings five examine everything hold fast to that which is true here's the truth Russ we need as Christians to test everything we hear against everything God has said test everything you hear from this pulpit or from a book or on the radio against what God has said some of you remember phone directories they're now in the Smithsonian I think but anyway back in the day you remember", "they would drop him off on your driveway no grain or I got eight of those in my pantry or whatever do you might not remember this but there was another company who decided back when people cared about phone directories I guess and you know other than putting your toddler on it so they're a little taller at the table like that's what some of us did in the room do you remember the Donnelly directory you might not but the Donnelly directory was trying to compete with the regular big yellow pages and and I remember their tagline of their advertisement they said our book is the book that the other guys don't want you to read and I thought you know that's that's exactly right this is the book that the other guys don't want you to read Satan does not want you to know or believe your Bible or to correctly understand your Bible because if you do he's in trouble the Bible is our measuring tape for truth jot it down Matthew 13 and verse 52 jesus said therefore every scribe who has become a disciple of the kingdom is like a head of a household who brings out of his treasure things new and things old the Bible is aren't treasure chests there is a truth for every trial you'll ever go through there's a word for every worry in your life and there is a promise for every problem do you know there are over 7,000 promises in the Bible that's about 19 a day for a year and I guarantee you whatever you're facing right now there's a promise of God there's a principle of God that applies to your life but you can never be relieved by what is yet to be believed if you don't know it if you don't understand it then you can't put your faith down on it put this down let it be know why the day of the Lord has not dawned yet why I put in the words why and Dawn look at verse 3 let no one in any way deceive you it referring to the day of the Lord will not come unless the apostasy comes first and the man of lawlessness is revealed the son of destruction now the term day of the Lord is a very involved term it's not about one day the day of judgment when God judges it's not a particularly it's a period of time you can read about it all through the Old Testament the Old Testament prophets spoke much of read Joel - a for instance but it's a day the", "Bible says of darkness and of gloom when God is pouring out his wrath on a world that has rejected him it is the time we refer to as the Great Tribulation it's called the time of Jacob's trouble and there's a number of reasons God has predicted it's going to come and Jesus spoke much about it and so does the Apostle Paul what was happening was these Christians were feeling that they were going through the Great Tribulation but the Scriptures teach that's not possible you see the day of the Lord it's interesting when you think about it if you think about it from a Jewish standpoint what time of day does a new day begin for a Jew sunset it was evening and morning and one day the Bible says their days begin in the evening unlike our days which begin at 12 a.m. or when the Sun comes up you got to understand the day of the Lord begins with darkness absolute gets darker and darker and darker but ultimately the Sun of righteousness will rise with healing in his wings you see that's a reference to the coming millennial reign of Christ the day of the Lord actually is not just the time of God's judgment but it extends even to the time when Christ will reign on the earth all of it is considered part of the day of the Lord there are two things that Paul says have not happened yet see we can't be in the day of the Lord and he mentions to will study a third one first of all the departure hasn't arrived yet the departure hasn't arrived there in verse three he says it will not come the day of the Lord unless the apostasy comes first now the first seven English translations of the Bible Tyndale Coverdale Wickliffe these first English translations all translated this word that's translated apostasy they all translated it with the word departure because this Greek word apostasy a' where we get our word apostasy which in our minds is colored with one thing people falling away from the faith that is a legitimate interpretation and translation of the word but it didn't only mean that from the Greek it had other meanings and one of them was a departure so it is a departure either from the faith a departure from the faith that's going to come Paul says that hasn't happened yet or a departure from a place masse to you both of those are true we can't be in the day of the Lord yet because the departure and he doesn't tell us exactly which one he's", "referring to but may I suggest to you both are true in fact I believe they're tied to each other the departure of the church from this world is what's going to precipitate the final departure into apostasy of the church if you read in Revelation you will find the chaste Bride of Christ the church is not there but you will find the harlot there which 17 Mystery Babylon and the false religion that will be all over this world so it's very interesting but we do know there is a departure coming from the faith jot down first Timothy 4 and verse 1 the spirit explicitly says that in the later times some will fall away from the faith paying attention to seat 'fl spirits and doctrines of demons and Jesus mentions this too with regard in the end times jotted down Matthew 24 verses 10 and 11 referring to the end at that time many will fall away and betray one another em hate one another many false prophets will arise and will miss lead many so we do know that there is going to be a falling away from the faith now here's the issue there has always been from the very beginning people that have fallen away from the faith they went out from us because they were never really of us John writes right so the wheat and the tares have always been in the church and there have been a pasta sizing Judas of pasta time so that's nothing new this has the definite article it's not general apostasy it is via apostasy the falling away so some argue that it must be an but in any case we believe it is both a departure of the church physically from the earth see from the viewpoint of Earth the removal of believers is a departure from the viewpoint of heaven it's the rapture so put this down number two also the Antichrist has not been revealed can't be the day of the Lord Paul says why well look at the text second half of verse 3 and the man of lawlessness is revealed the son of he hasn't been revealed so it can't be the day of the Lord now you know there are over 30 titles for this person in the Bible old and new Testament he's called the prince that will come he is called the little horn he has all kinds of titles like I said about 30 but the one that's stuck for the church are the five times that John uses the term Antichrist when I say Antichrist some of you picture Nicolae Carpathia", "Nikolai's not in the Bible anywhere just so you know but there is this one who is uniquely going to be empowered by Satan he's an imitation Messiah kind of it's an imitation incarnation is what it is but here's something that you think about yeah I don't know much about the Antichrist it's kind of scary I've read the books I watch the movie you need to know more about Antichrist than he is some person that will be coming in the Great Tribulation jot down first John four and verse three John says every spirit that does not confess Jesus is not from God this is the spirit of the Antichrist of which you have heard it is coming future and now it is already in the world very interesting there is a person a man coming who will be the incarnation of evil you might say the false messiah the false Christ that's Satan will empower you see Satan's an imitator absolutely just as we are waiting for Jesus Christ to come he is going to produce his own Christ but just as even though Christ is not yet here returning his spirit the spirit of crisis in the world so to this Antichrist before he comes the spirit of Antichrist is in the world and that's something worth thinking about why what is the spirit of Antichrist well we're told the nature of Antichrist in the text he opposes every form of God so he's godless or anti God but he also will seek to be worshipped as God or display himself as God in the temple now that's fascinating if you think about it you see the word anti can mean against aura can also mean a replacement he is the one who comes against Christ and everything Christ stands for but he also seeks to be the replacement Messiah in fact will be believed in by the Jews for a season did you know that Daniel says he will enter into a covenant with the Jews and so when you think about it here's a principle for us Satan really doesn't care if you believe in God or not he doesn't really care if you're an atheist or an evangelist so long as you weren't worshipping the true and living God see jesus said to the pharisees you're very Vangelis t'k you go about on land and sea to make one convert and when you make a convert you make them twice the son of hell that you are it doesn't matter if you're missing Church because you don't believe in God or because you're out surfing you made", "soccer your God or you know sleeping in it really doesn't matter or if you're here serving your brains out but you're full of self-righteousness what did Jesus say to Martha Martha you're worried about the wrong things you your sisters down at my feet worshipping you see and Satan's very subtle he just wants to get you from worshiping the true and living God whether you reject him or you just don't allow him to be everything that he wants to be in your life the Bible says God says you will have no other gods before me and no other gods beside me well do you know something the rabbi's today in our day right now in Israel the Orthodox rabbis teach the Messiah will be recognized first of all when you think when they talk about Messiah they're not talking about a supernatural being like we believe in Jesus Christ the Son of God no the Messiah is just a man and the Jewish rabbi say we will recognize our Messiah because he will be the man that will help us build our temple now that's talk about a setup because we know scripturally speaking that the Antichrist will come and make a covenant with them you know there's no temple right now in Jerusalem but there will be one at the time of the middle of the tribulation because the Antichrist will display himself as God and demand to be worshipped jot down John 5 and verse 43 a very interesting prophecy Jesus gave concerning the Antichrist he said I have come in my father's name and you do not receive me but if another comes in his own name you will receive him you might say that the Antichrist is going to teach replacement theology he's replacing God with himself and telling people to worship Him now in the Great which by the way begins in Revelation you know if you're interested in these things like how do we know it's pre-trib versus post-trib or mid-trib or you know whatever can I tell you I am so pre-trib I don't even eat post toasties anymore and if you're wondering why like you know there's somebody like I don't care just whatever it'll all pan out in the well you know I think there's truth about the timing that is very important of the way we live our lives and it'll affect us if you think you're in the tribulation right now because if you don't understand you're gonna be gone before these things happen you're gonna live like the Thessalonians did and a lot at trial if you just think about it", "the Bible says the proverbs 31 woman smiles at the future these folks think they're in the Great Tribulation and it's just starting it's like well it's just gonna get worse you're not smiling at your future if you think you're gonna go through the tribulation you know what you think I'm probably gonna die a horrible death well praise God for that you know and here's what Paul says in 1st Thessalonians God is not destined us for wrath but for obtaining salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ but if you don't have the hope of the not just the resurrection but the hope of the rapture the Bible calls the rapture our Blessed hope how is that a Blessed hope of yow it's gonna be you're gonna be dead even one of those dead bodies he's raising because that it makes no sense at all by the way another things very interesting to me as you read Revelation there's no greater description of the Great Tribulation than the book of Revelation you will find that the word church is not mentioned once in revelation 6 through revelation 19 during the time when all the wrath of God is poured out it's mentioned 7 times in Revelation 2 and 3 those are the letters to the existing churches of Asia Minor that were in existence in the first century Jesus sends letters to the churches and so the word church is used but as soon as you get to chapter 4 something completely changes and it's pretty remarkable and pretty radical if you've never studied the book of Revelation in chapter 4 John sees a door open in heaven and he hears the voice of a trumpet the voice that he had heard in Revelation 1 who we know you go read it's Jesus Christ it's no question about it and it's saying come up here and suddenly he was in the spirit and he's in heaven and he sees all the things that are happening during the tribulation from heavens famines point it's like this that your rapture John is suddenly in heaven the Saints are worshiping it's me and you you guys were there we're worshiping the one who is redeemed mankind from every tribe and every tongue were there we're not here but if you don't know that if you don't believe that like the church that that's not actually you're gonna have all kinds of concerns and your tribulation you're gonna think maybe is the Great Tribulation but revelation 6 begins with what's called the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse maybe you know those the first one that John sees when that first", "seal is opened on the scroll remember he is a white horse you say Oh somebody riding a white horse it's got to be Jesus keep reading no no the white horse Jesus is on is revelation 19 different different different guy now this is the beginning of the tribulation this is the beginning of God's wrath but it begins very interesting with a what appears to be a good guy on a white horse and he goes forth conquering and to conquer he has a bow but no arrows are mentioned and he accomplishes evidently peace in the world for a season but read the second third and fourth horses and you'll find that the second Horseman is war and the third is pestilence and disease and the fourth is death from pestilence and from war from the sword 25% of the world's population is killed do you know how many people that is you guys that is beyond our almost our imagination that's just starting out in the book of Revelation as the seals begin jesus said this world has never undergone anything like this before we've never seen it before there have been people who thought they were in the Great there were people preaching in Great Britain during World War two they were convinced him was the Antichrist and they were going through the Great Tribulation during the Blitz but it wasn't it's gonna be far worse than that oh no the fact is we need to know the timing of what God is doing but the Antichrist Paul says it can't be the day of the Lord because the Anti Christ has not been revealed and the Bible teaches us some more things about this one whose coming is called the son of lawlessness the son of perdition for instance we are where that he's going to bring peace to the world even peace in the Middle East he is the one who will be behind a one-world government he will restore the ancient Roman Empire that hasn't really existed for almost two thousand years he will put it back together that will be his his main place that he comes out of one world government a cashless society that's universalness economic system and a universal religion put all that together and think about it I mean can you even imagine can you imagine there no countries it isn't hard to do nothing to kill or die for and no religion too imagine all the people living life in yoo-hoo-hoo you may say I'm a dreamer I'm not the only one see this idea of coexisted come together and sing Kumbaya", "and hands across the world nothing new world's been waiting for it looking for it and is ready for it but the fact is the nation of Israel will accept that Messiah who will help them build their temple who will bring peace to the Middle East but he is going to be the false messiah now people have always wanted to know forever since it was written here who is the Antichrist do you know the preface to the King James Bible when he came out in 1611 actually declared the Antichrist is the Pope actually says you can go read it it's what they said Pope of the Catholic Church is the Antichrist of course people thought it was Hitler maybe if you were alive and living in that time and knowing your Bible you would have thought that - Stalin Kissinger I remember when Henry could every thought he was Khrushchev Castro Juan Carlos of Spain and Saddam who I say was insane but have all been accused and many many many countless others have been accused well he's the Antichrist he's the I think he's it some guys I have people come up to me especially when we do studies like this and they'll say hey Jim what about this guy you know Trump's gonna go help them build their tent we you know what do you think or they'll say do you think so-and-so is the Antichrist my answer is always same to the question of I think so-and-so is the Antichrist it's the same that I give or it's given him the song Jimmy cracked corn yeah I don't care cuz I don't plan to be here when he is revealed so if you think you know who he is you're wrong because you're still here look I am NOT gonna waste my time trying to figure out who the Antichrist might be when I can spend my time focusing on being whom Jesus Christ has called me to be isn't that why we're here that's the point we need to understand these things so it changes the way we live now look there are three symptoms briefly you can write them down there's no outline for you on this but just three things I want you to keep in mind three symptoms that if these things are going on in your life then something's wrong from our text first of all looking at this church their peace was disturbed they they had lost their peace they they were disturbed that's verse two secondly if you want to jump down there their minds were deceived that's verse three so your peace is disturbed", "secondly your mind is deceived that's a hard one to know many times because you can't tell but the third one is things that you know or have learned of the word of God and truths are being dismissed that's verse five look at verse five do you not remember that while I was with you I was telling you these things don't miss the point that's being made here do you remember when the women came to the tomb to finish the funeral they saw an angel the door is remember soldiers are shaking like dead men it's an amazing day we loved that day and then the angel says why are you seeking the living one among the dead you know the story he's not here he is risen but don't miss the next words just as he said now please don't miss the dig he didn't have to say he's risen who just go celebrate but I want to remind you you should know he told you that in Luke 24 it specifically says the angel he says remember what he was talking to you about up in Galilee he refers to a particular place and time remember when Jesus was saying this he it should have been obvious look before I was a full-time pastor I was a full-time police officer I was a detective one of my Jobs was to hire recruits to become police officers for the city of Placentia and you some of you know about this because of your corporate background and you've just heard the phrase there's a phrase you know or you should have known you know this or you should have known for instance in my line of work as a cop it was very important that if somebody had some problems in their background say they lost their temper and they punched somebody out a neighbor at work or whatever and then as a police officer I hired them to be a police officer and give them a badge and a gun if after I hire them they go and punch somebody out or shoot somebody excessive force guess what me and our city has a huge problem of extra liability why because we knew or should have known this person had a propensity of violence it's not just in law enforcement and she was all over the place with liability you knew or you should have known do you remember what Jesus said as he's coming into Jerusalem on Palm Sunday we call pump Sunday they didn't on Palm Sunday and he wept over Jerusalem and he said this if you had", "only known the things that make for peace especially in this thigh day but now they are hidden from your eyes what what's he talking about he's talking about a prophecy in Daniel 9 this was the day that Messiah was to be presented in an essence he's saying you knew where you should have known when here's what Paul was saying I talked to you about these things this should not be a problem but because you actually have forgotten or don't really understand the Word of God you have problems that you don't need to have interesting we can only be practically relieved by truth we've received and personally believed so here's our our tendency is to quote Bible verses to one another to comfort each other now it's not completely wrong but sometimes we make a mistake I've said it before something goes wrong in my life and my Christian friends want to quote count it all joy my brethren when you encounter various trials thinking that's going to come for me no quote it to yourself I need to believe it for myself you see but we are we have a tendency of sake Romans 8:28 you know all things are working together for good it's not that it's not true the problem is you and I have a much harder time believing it for ourselves but if we don't know the Word of God we can't believe the Word of God if we know and say we believe the Word of God then we're going to let it affect our lives Paul says you have dismissed the things you've learned and that's why you're having trouble put this down God's Word should excite your faith not ignite your fears but in the words faith and fears and jot down Romans 15 and verse 4 we're closed Romans 15 and verse 4 Paul says whatever was written in earlier times what's that a reference to the entire Old Testament for whatever was written in earlier times was written for our instructions so that through perseverance hanging in there and meaning both the encouragement of the scriptures we might have hope I read this peanuts cartoon years ago when Charles Schulz was still alive I want you to see it it's raining outside Lucy says to Linus boy look at it rain what if the floods what if it floods the he says that'll never happen in the ninth chapter of Genesis God promised Noah that would never happen again and the sign of the promise is a rainbow she smiles you've taken a great load off my he says sound theology has a way of", "doing that true then true now when you know and believe the Bible you won't have to worry about a lot of things you will worry about if you don't know or believe the Bible and a lot of the system we know it but do you believe it listen you only believe that portion of the Bible that you obey and that you're willing to apply to your own life so the question is do you believe these things close those luke 21:28 from the King James Bible here's what Jesus said he said when these things begin to come to pass he's talking about endtime events when these things begin to come to pass remember it's like birth pangs Jesus said like a woman who's going into labor and you know that that labor progresses as these things earthquakes and famines it's not that we have an earthquake oh jesus is coming back there'd been earthquakes a lost you know a famine you know their boys been temps or birth pangs they come closer together and more intense but he said when these things begin to come to pass look up lift up your heads for your Redemption draweth nigh listen the closer we get to Christ's return no matter how dark this world gets the closer we get to the rapture I can say things are looking up that doesn't mean that we rejoice and seeing suffering it means that we are realizing Jesus said it's gonna be this way and the Word of God gives me assurance he's taking us home where his bride he said I go to prepare a place for you that where I am you may be also he didn't say that where you are I will be also know he's coming to get us and if you're a child of God you don't have to fear by the way let me to say one of the things sometimes I hear people say well what if what if he doesn't take me you know well first of all if you're not a if you're not a Christian you need to come to Christ because if you don't have confidence he's gonna take you it may be you've never given your life to the Lord he is not coming for all men clearly he is coming for his church he is coming for his bride if you don't know if you're saved you need to settle that one the Bible says make your calling in your election sure how can I do that come talk to us coming the prayer we'd be happy to help you to know that but if", "you say well no I'm a Christian but I saw the movie and you know the left-behind thing and I've just you know afraid that my friends are gonna go and I'm not gonna make it you should not be living with that kind of a fear first of all God doesn't intend that for you but Satan does I've told you before Satan's goal is to make saved people think they're not and to cause people that aren't saved I think they are he's a liar so you don't have to fear well he's going to take you know half the congregation from the third row or a through K or you know somehow I'm I'm gonna be left behind the Bible is very clear he is coming back here's here's the group that get to go Paul put it this way we who were alive and remain now was we were alive and remained and had quiet times consistently for the last three weeks no we who are alive and remain I like to tell people this if I if I was a general and I was about to have to attack my enemy in a definitive way let's say I was gonna send in bombers with napalm fighters with napalm and I knew that my children were behind enemy lines right where I was gonna bomb and I could get them out before I did you have any question that I'd get him out if I had the power to do so listen when when the Great Tribulation was God declaring war basically on this world who was already at war with him and all hell will break loose Satan will be on the earth and he the Bible says in Revelation 12 but I can tell you this what happens before a nation declares war on another nation you know what they do they get their ambassadors out and that's what you are you're an ambassador for Jesus Christ he is going to get you out before he sends in the wrath of God let's pray father I pray then that you would help us to put our confidence in the Word of God and the promises of God that we wouldn't be afraid that we're gonna go through some trial beyond what you would want us to Lord that doesn't mean we won't suffer in fact we know that we will and we ought to and we would be ready Lord to suffer as some do in this world far beyond what we have ever imagined but lord thank you that that is not the Great Tribulation ours feels great because it's ours", "the Lord because you're in charge of everything that happens in our life you are working together even the hardest of things to bring us closer to you to make us more like you bless you and come for us when you're ready make us ready in Jesus name Amen", "consider taking one of those classes now I'd like you to open your Bibles finally got there to First John chapter 4. first John chapter 4 and we're going to look at verses one through six together I hope you brought your Bible please I want to encourage you to become re-familiarized with your Bible if you have it electronic I don't put that down I know some people think I've had people say Bob I like coming to the church because you you everybody brings their Bible and I'm thrilled about that I bring mine too uh but uh I I think it's still the word of God you know it I don't think you're more spiritual if you have a scroll today uh so if you have a physical printed book or electronic it still works first John chapter 4 beloved do not believe every but test the spirits see whether they're from God because many false prophets have gone out into the World by this you know the spirit of God every spirit that confesses Jesus Christ Has Come In the Flesh well that's that every spirit that does not confess Jesus is not from God this is the spirit of the Antichrist of which you have heard it is coming and now is already in the world you're from God little children and you've overcome them because greater is he who is in you than he who is in the world they are from the world therefore they speak as from the world and the world listens to them we're from God and he who knows God listens to us he who is not from God does not listen to us by this we know the spirit of and the spirit of our father how I pray you would equip us as your children as your Saints as your servants to be able to know when you are speaking and when you're not Lord I pray we would become so familiar with truth that when there is falsehood being spoken we can detect it the Lord thank you that you are instructing us to protect us and correct us when necessary so that we might not get off track we know the enemy is extremely subtle cunning and has a wisdom to undermine your people's beliefs always has always will and so Lord help us to be protected and we thank you that you're going to speak to us today we ask you to do it on a personal level for each one of us in amen you can be seated you know the Bible says that in the last", "difficult times will come and will be lovers of self but also there will be a falling away a giving of ourselves over that is the church not necessarily us individually but giving selves over to listening to the doctrines of demons and false teaching and false teachers will multiply there have always been false teachers throughout history but they will multiply during the end times and Jesus talked about this uh there in the Olivet discourse Matthew 24 and 25 and we are told clearly in the Book of Revelation that many people will be deceived during the time before the Rapture actually and during the Great Tribulation but put this down Believers must discern if you're taking notes Believers must discern there are many deceivers you know if I say the name John Marshall some of you how many of you have ever heard the name John Marshall some of you go I've heard it but I don't know who he he was one of our founding fathers but there was another John Marshall that has more to do with what I want to talk about this morning John Marshall of California not one of the founding fathers but same name and uh it was in 1848. that he was a he was a carpenter and he was building a sawmill up in just north of Sacramento Northeast of Sacramento and one day while he was building it there in the in the water he saw some some glitter and he thought it might be gold and so he and Sutter the owner Johann Sutter uh discovered yep it was the real deal and that was the beginning of what we call the gold rush 300 000 people not just from the United States from actually other countries flooded into California San Francisco at that time by the way was only 200 people within just a few years it'd be 36 000 people the Gold Rush was on then came the 49ers you know that's that's the I I think 49ers I think of Pancakes that Original House of Pancakes but this was this was all these people with one dream in life and that is if I could just get my hands on some gold but the ads are of all collect the lottery you know billion dollars now or whatever it was recently everybody's that's my answer and so everybody floods to get a hold of of gold because hey I can retire I can live wealthy my family will be fine and the reason I I mentioned John Marshall's name is you should know this as Californians the what is the state motto", "it's on the state seal it's a Greek word and it's the word Eureka if you ever see the state steel Eureka it's used 160 times in the New Testament and the word Eureka means I I found it by the way it's used in passages like in the Gospel of John when Andrew who was following Jesus goes and gets Simon Peter's brother and he says we have found him the Messiah and then when Philip in the same chapter goes and gets Nathaniel we have found him of who Moses and the prophet speak it's Eureka I found it and that was what the attitude was when somebody found gold is like this is the answer I finally found it wouldn't be long before any prospective prospector would discover there was something else that looked just like it yeah iron pyrite is what it's actually called we call it fool's gold and you would find it it would look the same but you would have to find a way how do I know the difference between that which looks like gold but actually is gold put this down realize all the Glitters isn't when it comes to teaching there are false teachers who claim to be revealing truth from God from the Bible or from Revelations they've had or from insights that they have listen to September 22nd 1823 Joseph Smith claims an angel named Moroni revealed to him among other artifacts a set of 40 to 60 pound Golden Plates under a stone of considerable size near his father's Farm four years later and 18 months after being convicted for fraud and admitting in court he told people he had Smith says Moroni this Angel allowed him to take the plates home and translate them from reformed Egyptian into English thus creating the Book of Mormon at first he wouldn't let anyone else look at them if they did they would die he said Raiders of the Lost Ark later Smith had a revelation that more people could safely see the plates and eventually a total of 11 Witnesses claimed to have seen them once the translation was complete Smith said Moroni retrieved the plates and took them back to heaven where they reportedly still reside today how did the illiterate Joseph Smith translate the Golden Plates he could only read a little English and he definitely didn't know any reformed uh he also Couldn't Write what's a prophet to do to translate Smith said the angel Moroni gave him two transparent translation Stones the urum and the famine which he could use as magic glasses to read the plates at first Smith went through a", "series of scribes who wrote down his words while he did with the plates behind a blanket or curtain later he would translate without even using the plates seeing the text via the urimanthamon in his Mind's Eye thus began Mormonism shot down Galatians 1 verses 6 through 8. Paul said this to the Galatians I'm amazed that you are so quickly deserting him who called you by the grace of Christ for a different gospel which is really not another only there are some who are disturbing you and want to distort the gospel of Christ but even though we or an angel named Moroni no it doesn't an angel from heaven should preach to you a gospel contrary to that which we have preached to you let him be anathema let him be a curse jot down II Corinthians 11 verses 13 through 15. for such men he's talking about these false teachers in his day such men are false Apostles deceitful workers disguising themselves as Apostles of Christ and no wonder for even Satan disguises himself as an angel of Light therefore it is not surprising if his servants also disguise themselves as Servants of righteousness whose end shall be according to their Deeds now we've been talking a lot in first John about how can I know that I'm a Child of God we've discovered that a child of God is going to obey God's Commandments that they're going to believe on Jesus Christ not just believe that Jesus of Nazareth existed or even that he died in Rose again but put our personal faith in him a Believer is to have an open heart but not a blind eye jot down Proverbs 14 and verse 15. the gullible believe anything they're told The Prudent sift and way every word acts 17 11. many of you are familiar with this passage as Paul is preaching the gospel to different cities he's already been to thessalonica and then he's gone to Berea and here's what it says about those Believers in Berea these Jews who became Believers these and Maria were more noble than those in thessalonica in that they received the word with all Readiness of mine and they searched the scriptures that would be the Old Testament in their case they searched the Scriptures Daily whether those things were so in other words they didn't just take Paul though he was a God ordained Apostle preaching the truth he commended the bereans because they didn't just accept what he said but they were willing to even check out what he said regarding the Gospel of Jesus Christ against the Old Testament the", "bereans were more noble than those in I hope and pray you know how to identify what I call a longhorn sermon maybe you've never heard of that a longhorn sermon is a point here and a point here and a lot of bull in between we should make it our goal to be no bull you know the the fact is this truth many times is somewhere in the middle of extremes often a right understanding of scripture is is a balance for instance when it comes to the gifts of the holy spirit it seems like there are those who want to fall off this the horse on either side of extreme Focus over emphasizing it or diminishing it completely they don't exist today or they're not for today or you shouldn't stay away from God's given us gifts we're supposed to stay away from them that doesn't make any sense don't read the book of Revelation it'll mess you up that's why God give it I'm going to mess up my people really makes no sense to me at all you know when it comes to this for instance in first we are told when it comes to prophetic utterances don't quench the Holy Spirit don't despise prophetic utterances you know what the next phrase is examine everything hold fast to that which is we shouldn't despise it we shouldn't say don't do it we should say God's use your gifts but Lord help me to be wise and just see put this down test what comes from their lips doctrinally here's what we look at in verse one it says test the spirits to see whether they are from God because many false prophets have gone out verse Two by this you know the spirit of God every Spirit by the way Spirits only have mouths through men so don't go how are spirits talking here by this you know the spirit of God every spirit that confesses Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is from God jot down Revelation 2 and verse 2. Jesus said to the church I know your deeds and your toil and your perseverance this is the church in Ephesus you cannot endure evil men and you here it is put to the test those who call themselves Apostles and they're not and you have found them to be you know there's a lot of things going on in our day people have questions and there are important issues going on certainly in our day as in any generation but what's what's the most important question of the day can I tell you the most important question of the", "day is not are there aliens now I know there are people that are very interested in that uh even seems like Congress seems to finally be interested in that nor is it really will a I destroy our lives or be the answer to our lives or take all of our jobs away interesting question I listen the most important question is not going to be in this next year who is going to be the next president of the United States that's getting a lot of a lot of time who's going to be the nominees who's going to be there which which president's going to get impeached or indicted first you know that is not the most important question I'm going to tell you the most important question of our day of any day here it is who is you might even want to write that down who is Jesus Christ why do I say that because he said that he asked his disciples this in caesarea Philippi who do men say that I am Jesus had a habit of coming back to that remember he would ask the Jews what thinky of the Christ whose son is he oh well he's the son of David oh really then why does it say in the Psalms the Lord said to my Lord sit at my right hand and tell I make your enemies your footstool if really all he is it's true he must descend from David but if he's just the descendant of David why would David speak to him as his Lord makes no sense they didn't have an answer for that Jesus is always helping people to realize your view of who he is your view of who the Messiah is is diminished but who do men say that I am and of course his disciples said well some think you're John the Baptist raised from the dead remember that was Herod Herod thought that he said some think you're like you're Jeremiah was the weeping prophet who wept over and prophesied the destruction of Jerusalem remember the book of Lamentations is a book of lament it's a funeral dirge that Jeremiah wrote as he watched his prophecies come about as the Babylonians came in and destroyed God's people because they refused to repent and he had this heart for God's people something here like Jeremiah Jesus Will weep over Jerusalem again as he comes down the mountain on that on that donkey on Palm Sunday or one of the other prophets you know great power like Elijah and Elisha raising the dead basically the disciples", "said well who do men say that I am that that all depends on on who you ask who is Jesus you see today if you ask people the question do you believe in Jesus and they say I believe in Jesus what you have to ask is well which Jesus do you mean Islam believes in Jesus they do he's a dead Prophet as far as they're concerned Judaism believes in Jesus he's not just a dead Prophet he's a dead false prophet Buddhism would say that Jesus was an Hinduism says that Jesus was one God of the 33 million gods that they worship and Jehovah's Witnesses believe that Jesus was a created being a created angel and the Mormon which we've already believed he was the spiritual brother of Lucifer Christian Science which is by the way neither teaches that Jesus was a man upon whom the Christ Consciousness came on him listen the most important question is the question then Jesus followed up not who do men say that I am the all-important question who do you say that I am that is the most important question anyone can ever ask and those of you who have answered it correctly now need to remember that when you're talking to other people not what church do you go to how much of the Bible do you read how how much do you pray how much sin are you committing who do you believe Jesus is that's the question it's always been the question it'll always be the question until Jesus 50 years ago it's hard to believe that long ago now wrote these words in a song Some say he was an outlaw that he roamed across the land with a old fishermen no one knew just where he came from or exactly what he'd done but they said it must be something bad kept him on the Run some say he was a poet that he'd stand upon the hill that his voice could calm an Angry Crowd and make the wave stand still that he spoke in many parables that few could understand but people sat for hours just to listen to this man some say he was a sorcerer a man of mystery he could walk upon the Water he could make the blind man see that he conjured wine at weddings and did tricks with fish and bread he talked to being born again and raised people from the dead some say he was a politician who spoke of being free he was followed by the masses on the shores of Galilee he spoke out against corruption and he bowed to", "and they fear to strengthen his power so they nailed him to a tree some say he was the son of God a man above all men and that he came to be a servant and to set us free from sin that's who I believe he is because that's what I believe and I think we should get ready because it's time for us to leave interesting no matter what age you're in that's still the most important question who is Jesus Christ to you who do you say that I am that's why even at a funeral when people before Jesus raises the guy from the dead he talks to the people everybody there he's got a captive audience you know funerals are usually audiences that will only come together once the people who knew that person very unique and Jesus at lazarus's funeral does not talk about Lazarus he really doesn't other than to say he'll rise again which again there's nothing wrong with remembering a person's life I think it honors the Lord but it's interesting to me where Jesus's Focus was he doesn't say let's do a slideshow of Lazarus or I remember these fun times with a lot of you doesn't talk about that let other people do that what does Jesus say to the people at I am the resurrection what I thought this was about a lot of I am the resurrection of the life he who believes though he were dead yet shall he live and he who lives and Believes In Me will never die and then he said this do you he didn't even say Lazarus believed that do you believe that because that's the question for the living do you believe it he took that opportunity to say what do you believe about me it's the most important question I could ever ask anyone in my life and I'm asking all of you do you well put this down not only do we need to test what comes from their lips Doctrine what do they say about Jesus but test how they live personally how they live personally now I say that because the text tells us they are to confess Christ confess Jesus now they must when it's here talking about their view of Jesus doctrinally is that he is God come in the flesh in other words it speaks of Christ's humanity and his deity many false doctrines do damage to in our day in the first century there were those actually of the Gnostic belief that did damage to Christ's Humanity they said he couldn't have been actually a human being because that's", "that's completely evil so there's no way he was actually human you know or whatever so whether you deny his Humanity which few do today but didn't or deny his deity much more common the problem with false doctrines false teachings is that usually they're deficient in their view of either the person listen to me the person or the work of Jesus Christ he wasn't born of a virgin they will say or he didn't actually come he didn't live a sinless life and once you start diminishing the person in the work of Jesus Christ this is the essence of false teachers however a second test is that they confess Christ I talked about this last week when we speak about believing in Jesus Christ we believe that his not just his name is Jesus and that he lived but who he is as our savior because that's what his name in other words when I say I believe in Jesus it means I believe that I'm a sinner I need a savior and there is one person who came to die for my sins a sinless life a sacrificial death Resurrection from the dead I'm saying I believe in that Jesus that I need so if you say anything less than that you've got the incorrect Doctrine but even if you believe those things are true does not mean that you've asked him to come into your life and forgive you you have to apply it to your life but also remember they believe in Jesus the Christ the the meshiach the the anointed one the one who has been designated by God to fulfill all of his promises not just to Israel but to a lost world to come and Rule and redeem man and if you believe in the Christ now we're talking about his sovereignty in your life that he's the Lord of your life remember in Romans that if you'll confess with your mouth Jesus as now to confess and say he's the Lord that's not what it's talking about it's about you really surrendering it's true nobody can say and mean Jesus is Lord except by the power of the Holy Spirit you come to this place we realize Lord I recognize what you've done for me I ask you to forgive me and I now release control of my life from here on out Lord not just that in a service not just in a moment of difficulty but Lord for the rest of my life I want to learn to let how do they live personally as I said confessing Christ is more than speaking truth about him remember we've", "said it before but the demons seem to have no problem talking the right talk they know the truth jot down Luke 4 and verse 34 these are what the demons said when they saw Jesus ha what do we have to do with you Jesus of Nazareth have you come to destroy us listen to this I know who you are you are the Holy One Of God that is perfect Doctrine demons have really good Doctrine but here's what I would suggest to you confession of Christ is more than confession the word homologous to confess means to say the same thing to agree in other words to put your own heart and mind into it professing is just words demons have great Doctrine in Acts verses 6 acts 16 verse 17. Paul is there in Philippi following the call from the Macedonian man and there's this slave girl who had been doing um fortune telling for her Masters by a demon and she would follow Paul and the others around Paul and Silas around it says following after Paul and us she kept crying out saying these men are Bond Servants of the most high God who are proclaiming to you the way of now I want you to think about it what did she say that was not true nothing everything that little slave girl who was demon-possessed said I know she's demon possessed how do I know it because he cast The Demon out of her everything she said about them was absolutely 100 true he said why would Paul cast you know why would Paul cast a demon out of her she's she's out telling people The Truth Listen I wouldn't want Playboy magazine advertising our church you don't need demons to endorse you but they speak truth many times Matthew verses 15 through 20 Beware of the false prophets who come to you in sheep's clothing but inwardly are ravenous wolves you will know them by their fruits grapes are not gathered from Thorn bushes nor figs from thistles are they even so every good tree Bears good fruit but the bad tree Bears Bad fruit a good tree cannot produce bad fruit nor can a bad tree produce good fruit every tree that does not bear good fruit is cut down thrown into the fire so then you will know them by their one of the earliest Christian documents that we have other than the New Testament written by Believers is known as the didake means the teaching that's what the Greek word means means the teacher the Dida K is considered authentic and relates to", "what is called the full title is the teaching of The Twelve or the teaching of The Twelve Apostles it's not inspired but it is an early early Christian doctrine that tells us something about what the apostles in the early church taught in the dead arcade which is by the way dated about the same time as the Book of Revelation about 180. um there's a reference there it says um this is a quote not everyone who speaks in the spirit is a prophet he is only a prophet if he walks in the way of the Lord in other words this is what God's word teaches we are to test both the content of what comes out of their lips but also the character of what comes out of their life both are essential in a value they may say everything correct but the character of their lives it's important to understand this is what Jesus said you will know them by their fruit what what is it you know what kind of you know my my smallest grandchild can understand what kind of a tree it is if there's oranges on it's an orange tree you don't have to be a botanist or what agricultural expert to figure that out Jesus saying look at what they produce not just what comes out of their that could be right remember some of you have been with me on Wednesday night we're studying Balaam everything Balaam said was right about the lord it's actually part of our scripture we can study it it was correct but that didn't mean balaam's motives and lifestyle are correct at all you can read the book of Job there's a lot of things said about God in there and and it's inspired scripture there's a lot of things said about job in there and some of them are flat out wrong just just keep that in mind people can doesn't mean that they themselves have the right motives or that they necessarily are representing the Lord we are not someone has said this you've heard it before we're not to be judges we're not to judge one another but we are to be fruit inspectors put this down letter be know why you can rest and how you can test in verse 4 of our text he says you are from God little children and have overcome them those worldly false teachers because greater is he who is in you than he who is in the world so first of all I'll put this down know how you can be protected protected as Believers we don't have to", "fear that we're going to fall into uh unbelief because of false teaching we are to be wise and able to judge it but we need to know biblically how we are protected and that's why he says greater is he who is in you than he who is in the world there is a worldly system Satan wants to infect and affect Believers if he can but he gives us this assurance in verse 4 we have overcome the world which is what he says again later in first John even our faith overcomes the world you know they have submarines that have actually gone down into the Mariana Trench for those of you that don't know Mariana Trench is the deepest place that we've ever discovered in the ocean in the Pacific Ocean it is uh over two miles down under the water and these these uh obviously these submarines that survive that are made of extremely thick steel plates to withstand the pressure we all very familiar with the recent tragedy that's just happened but you know it's interesting when they go down there to explore the depths of the ocean you know what they find there are sins no just so I throw that in see if you're um but they take they take pictures there and they have actually found fish that survive way way down at this incredible depth where the pressures are unimaginable and uh where they have to have these steel plates to be able to survive within the submarine and people ask well how could a little tiny little fish it looks so fragile how could it survive and the answer to that is this there are also pressures inside the fish that are equal to the pressures that are being exerted on the outside of the fish and I love that illustration because that's the beauty of being a Christian the Holy Spirit has come in yes Satan is going to assail you yes there will be Temptations yes there will be trials yes he'll try to implode your life but greater is he who is in you than he who is in the world the spirit of God has come to exert a pressure Beyond you're not supposed to I gotta I'm falling like a part no the spirit of God will give you the capacity to withstand whatever Temptations trials that you might go through even the deception so put this down number two see why they those false teachers are infected in verse 5. they are from the world therefore they speak as from the world and the world listens", "to them so here's the basic idea those from the world speak worldish to other or maybe called Earthlings but he says you are not of this world Jesus said this to his disciples at one point he said you're not of this world as I he said am not of this world now you are originally of this world remember this is John 3 talking to Nicodemus Jesus said that which is born in the flesh is flesh if you've only had a human birth that you are of this world you are from this but the person who's going to enter the kingdom of God has to have a new birth there must be a spiritual birth of birth from above or to be born again the word can be translated either way very interesting but Jesus said to his disciples you're not of this world as I am not of this world he said I am from above and in essence every Christian has been born from above you have a new existence if you will yes you're still in the world but you're no longer of the world remember the Bible is really clear it divides the entire world this entire group of people you'll ever meet into two classes there are the Saints and the now if you're one who says oh I'm not a saint well that makes you an ain't then you want to listen remember Paul the Apostle writes his letters to Christians and he always calls them saints he never says to the Christians in Corinth he never says that they didn't use that term for us we use that term he doesn't say to the Believers he says to the Saints and remember the Church of Corinth was one had a lot of problems they were carnal he said that not me First Corinthians 3. you're of the flesh you got immorality going on you guys are all in the divided camps as to who's the greatest teacher and you're all messed up you're speaking in tongues and nobody knows what they're talking about to come he had all kinds of Correction for them backslidden Christians a lot of them but he called them saints so listen when I say you are Saints don't go well thank you very much it's not a compliment it's pure grace do anything to get it except believe in Jesus and that was enough God reckoned it onto you your faith is righteousness he sees you in Christ and Christ is the ultimate the word Saint hagias just means the Holy One remember that's who Christ is he's the", "Holy One you know don't ever be bragging about your election ah he chose me I don't know about you chose me no he chose Christ and if you believe you're in Christ so that's why you're chosen because you're in Christ don't you understand we have the benefits the blessings of who Jesus is attributed to us because of nothing we didn't deserve it by the grace of God we have found all the promises all the blessings of God in relationship to Jesus and so he sees us as he sees his son we're in Christ we are not just forgiven we're righteous I've often said although we probably won't do it I had a friend who used to come here his name was Paul he really liked this idea of calling each other so I used to call him Saint Paul he'd call me Saint Bob my joke was it works for everybody unless your name is Bernard and you know and Bernie always comes up and talks to me after I say that in a service Point thanks a lot Bob but uh but you you are I know people won't understand if you start calling just call me Saint this world will not understand that but you should have the patience of a it's one of the fruit of the holy spirit is to have Spirit-filled patience so if you don't say God I want to have more of the character of Christ in my life you're long suffering you're you're slow to anger Lord I'm quick to anger and I you know I'm not like you but by your spirit I can become like you as Christ comes in and dwells me and fills me and produces fruit through me I can have and I will have the patience of Jesus Christ you see but the world on the other hand has none the worldly appeal of those false teachers here we're not wretched sinners in the world we're talking about those who are religious within the church the worldly appeal in the church is something that has happened and continues to thrive in our day frankly I'm very concerned about the Seeker sensitive movement less is said about it nowadays but it's very I can't tell you how many people who have moved here or move away from here come back to me and say Bob I'm living in this I won't mention any particular area I can mention just about any area we say I can't find it a church that teaches the Bible oh I find churches that open the Bible I find churches that mention the Bible and", "they certainly mention Jesus and they sing a lot but frankly they don't talk from the Bible and not only that they never talk about Sin they never talk about judgment they never talk about hell they talk more about how God's word will help people to have a more happy and fulfilled life but they never talk about the need to repent they never talk about the need to to turn your life over to cry there's something missing but there is a worldly appeal many times in the secret sensitive movement I think many people are are well-meaning they want unbelievers to come to church to hear the word of God but that's not exactly how Jesus didn't do that remember Jesus's message was always the that's not where you want to start with people it's like you know if you want to hear anything more averages you start with you gotta change but that was John the Baptist method message and that was Jesus's message repent for the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand what's he talking about let me just go back to what I said at the very beginning you're gonna die and you're you need to turn your mind around about not just the way you're living but where your faith is to change and people don't want to hear that what they want to hear is how much God loves me and how he wants to do all these good things for me and how he wants to give me that boyfriend and that girlfriend and that successful job or that money or whatever God wants me to be happy so let's talk about you know Jesus said I came that you might have life and might have it abundantly oh like that one to delight yourself with the Lord you know that was my favorite I'll give you the desires of your heart oh wow I get to we in other words you can emphasize this man-centered gospel and not preach the truth of God's word and there will be people who will the Bible says in the last days they'll accrue to themselves teachers having itching ears tickle my ears tell me something good do you know the false prophets throughout history always told people what they wanted to I was reading an occasion yesterday where one king was trying to figure out if he should go into the in the battle the king of Israel who's Wicked and the king of Judah the southern Kingdom Jehoshaphat who is a man who believed in the Lord but he was kind of and the king of Israel is is consults", "what do you guys say should I go into battle oh yes go into battle you're going to win for sure King Force God's and jealous of that says well isn't there like a prophet of the Lord another he goes well there's this one I named Micaiah I don't like him because whenever he prophesies he always he never prophesies anything good about Joseph well we should we should probably so they call Micaiah Makaya first just kind of pretends everything's fine just go go he said you you tell me something from the Lord he goes okay you're going to get killed basically here's a good picture of our world here's a good picture of the church tell me what I now God loves me it wants to prosper me and it's not that God doesn't love you he's proven his love for you by dying on the cross for your sin but his message to you is death is real hell is real and you need to repent of your sins not because you're going to earn heaven but because you need to stop putting Jesus Christ off the throne and allow him to be the god of your life and to apply the truth of what he's done for you on the if you ignore those truths when you're sharing the gospel you're trying to get people to pray a prayer to add Jesus to their life they're not going to be saved Jesus is not an addict like Juice It Up add it to my life you know then I'll fit in with my Christian friends and then I'll sing the songs and I'll get no no no Jesus Christ comes to give you a new life you have to let go of the life you have if you're trying to hold on to your life and add Jesus it won't work you must come to the end of your life Jesus said if anyone wishes to come after me deny yourself take up your cross not just believe in my cross take up yours when a man took up his cross in the ancient world any time it meant he was going to die that day you took up your cross to die on it say well what do you mean Bob I Gotta Die yes you have to die to yourself you have to die to your will you have to say I want to be dead to my sin because of what Jesus Christ he already died in my sin I don't want to die to my sin that he might live in and through me amen", "have you done that is that your message don't give anything less than that to people of just adding Jesus that is not what the Bible teaches but the worldly appeal many times is just saying give me what I want jot down II Timothy Chapter 4 verses 2 through 4. I mentioned this a moment ago Paul says to Young Timothy a pastor preach the word Don't Preach the politics Don't Preach just the latest Trend preach the word be ready in season and out of season in other words there will be times people want to listen and plenty of times they don't reprove which is to admonish rebuke tell people they're going the wrong way exhort which is to encourage with great patience and instruction here it is for the time well I'll say it has come when they will not endure sound Doctrine but wanting to have their ears tickled they will accumulate for themselves teachers in accordance to their own desires they'll turn away their ears from the truth and they'll turn aside and so there are so many I believe that are in that camp who celebrate Jesus they're fans of Jesus they're not living for Jesus they're living in sin they're those that Jesus spoke about in Matthew 7 who will say Lord Lord did we not and he'll say I don't even know you oh yeah I prayed the prayer I know you but I don't know you the evidence is the way you're living your life stop deceiving you've heard me say there was a guy who told his friend who wasn't sure if he needed some medical procedure he said I've got a great doctor if you can't afford the surgery my doctor will touch up the X-ray for you and I fear there are too many false teachers in our day who are trying to do just that let's touch up the X-ray Galatians 1 10 pulse it for am I now seeking the favor of men if you read what he said right before that you would know he's not for am I now seeking the favor of men or of God or am I striving to please men if I were still trying to please men I would not be a bond servant of Christ those don't go in the same care you cannot be a man pleaser and a god pleaser now let me tell you what that means in at times it means I'm not trying to but if I'm faithful to God's word it means the times I'm going to say things that are going to bother you", "I'm not I don't look how could I bother God's people my goal is not to bother you I love you if I had it my way I'd avoid those things but I can't have it my way and honor God listen when it comes down to it I'm going to stand before God not you it's not going to stand before it happens one of my the congregation think about Bob company well we really like that's not going to have any meaning to me no offense I love you but you don't decide by eternity I have to honor God and that means I'm going to tell you things you're not going to lie it means I'm going to tell you things that maybe you you think well that's your opinion and if it's my opinion throw it out you test it to the by the word of God and if it's in the word of God then you take it from God but I'm going to try it with all my heart whatever whatever grains of time I to be faithful to speak to you from God's word the truth of God's word you measure it according to God's word but if it's God who's speaking to you like Amelia said don't fight against God forget me deal with God but it's not my attempt to try to bother you but I tell you what when I read the Bible there are times it bothers me it's like that that Chinese man who's given a Bible by a missionary one day the next day he came back he gave it back he said you know what he goes no I don't want it he goes did you read it he goes I read it he goes why are you giving it back he goes because every time I read it it kicks me see the word of God Alone we've said this before Hebrews 4 12 and 13 the word of God pierces to the division of Soul and Spirit joint marrow and it judges the thoughts and the intentions of the when you say search me o God he says okay but don't think he's going to do that in a vacuum he does that through the word of God God's word will evaluate your life your thinking your motives God will get to the core of who you are and if I'm faithful to teach God's word the teaching should do that from time to time sometimes you'll go amen I'm doing that right amen amen Bob's got that one wrong you know you're going to have as am I but nonetheless we need to", "realize the world just wants to hear what the world wants to hear put this see how they are detected in verse six these false teachers he says we're from God he who knows God listens to us he who is not from God does not listen to us and by this we know the spirit of truth and the spirit in essence John puts his finger on it right here the problem with the world is it cannot handle the truth that's exactly right it cannot handle the truth jot down John 8 and verse 47 he who is of God Jesus said hears the words of God for this reason you do not hear them he said to the Jews because you are not of God this is one of the tests of a of somebody as to whether they're a false in the book of Acts Stephen is the first of the church kind of like Abel was the first martyr in human history Stephen is the first one to die for his faith and he's he dies preaching the gospel before The Supreme Court of Israel before the Sanhedrin who had ordered Christ's death and if you go and read there in the book of actual you'll hear this incredible sermon Spirit-filled sermon that Stephen gave the Bible says they could not cope with his wisdom in other words they didn't have an ant I could these learned men couldn't give Stephen an answer for his theology as he was saying Jesus was the Messiah the Bible says they saw his face as a face of an Angel but as he was going on it bothered them so much what he was saying not only about their responsibility of Killing Jesus but exalting Jesus as the Messiah the Bible says you know what they did they put their fingers in their ears and they rushed upon him and they stoned him to death this is a good picture the world does not want to hear the truth there are those who will not hear the gospel from you by the way don't go trying to chase people down to argue with them Jesus never did that you'll never find Jesus ran after the pharise come back he didn't do that he said don't give what is Holy to dogs don't cast your Pearl Before Swine that won't pay off it's not your job to argue by the way no one's ever argued into the kingdom of God well I got this argument logically you know I'm gonna twist their arm and get you I'm not Christian I believe that is the way it works", "but the world will not hear and that's one of the evidences thereof the world is they won't have ears to hear Jesus said they don't listen to me think of Pontius Pilate you know it's amazing about that trial of Jesus is it really wasn't the trial is the trial of Pilate that was his moment to make a decision about who is Jesus that was it and he tries to wash his hands and say well it's not my fault and I you know you could put this on somebody else I'm not going to decide today or it's not I can't decide or no decision is a she just said you're either for me or there is no middle ground you make no decision that is a decision when Jesus is saying let me into your life a pilot at one point in the trial said because of something Jesus had said about his kingdom because she said my kingdom is not of this world otherwise my servants would be fighting he said oh then you are a you are agreeing that you're a king I and Jesus said these words for this I and for this reason I came into this that I might testify of the truth at which point Mr philosophy major himself says what is what is truth now we know it's not the question of what is truth but John 14 6 who is truth Jesus said I am the way I am hi alathea I am the truth and no one comes to the father but by me here is literally incarnate perfect truth standing in front of Pontius Pilate some people can't see the truth because they can't handle the truth when it's staring them in the face that's true and this world does not want to the truth they need to hear it God will give some Grace to repent it's been said some drink at the fountain of truth but most Jesus said my sheep hear my voice you know when it comes to gold there's a variety of ways I've discovered from Reading how you can know if it's real gold now some of these people that were gold Hunters became very Adept at just they I guess if you've handled enough of the false stuff you can tell but for most of them you they had different methods sometimes they would actually bite what appeared to be gold because gold is soft iron pyrite is not maybe why they had lost their teeth I you can use a magnet because actually gold is not magnetic or silver but iron pyrite sure is and so", "that's another way but as saying Metals there's been a variety of ways throughout the centuries and one of the most familiar from the ancient world was you had to heat it up you had to heat it up to see if it was really the real deal another method was called a touchstone I don't know if you've ever heard of this this is a picture of a touchstone it looks like somebody's makeup thing or a piano but it's actually those are rubbings of gold to see if it's gold because a touchstone is a kind of a stone that if you rub it with real gold it will look that color whereas if it's Fool's Gold it's black or green it's a completely different color what I want to remind you of as far as when someone has something to say how do I know if it's the real deal this is your Touchstone this is it you need to know your Bible you need to check out what's being said from this pulpit and any Pulpit or any book or any teacher on the radio from this book don't just say well he they use the Bible Pastor Bob always is the Bible that doesn't mean that you can know that everything I'm saying is accurately being interpreted you need to know the Bible and you need to know how to interpret the Bible jot down Isaiah 8 and verse 20. here's what Isaiah says to the people of Israel who are being tempted to get into Sorcerers and listening to fortune tellers he says to the law and to the testimony talking about the word of God if they do not speak according to this word it's because they have no light in them or they have no Dawn in them how do we detect false teachers we are to know the word of God that is our Touchstone that's why he says in Thessalonians examine everything how do I do it I do it by checking it according to the word of God now it's interesting to me we're talking about examining false teaching but you know they the Bible Paul the Apostle in 13. says to that church something very he says test yourself uses the same Greek word we're to test but he says you know what the word is dakimazo in the Greek it means to test something so as to approve it if we would say to assay metal to make sure it's the real deal test yourself he said to see if you be in the faith lest you failed the test in other words", "we are to test teachers to see if what they're saying is true and he's telling us how but we're also to see if we in fact are in Christ and Christ is in US there was a young lady that I knew in high school part of our youth group her dad was the one who prayed with me to receive Christ when I was 13. so I've always appreciated their family and Leslie who's my age or a year younger she she wrote a song years ago and she shared it with our high school group when we were up in Yosemite and it was called uh till you and I love it because it talked about this issue of hearing the voice of God and she said throughout my life my door of Love did not once open wide all the world and even I knew not what there were those who gently knocked and some who stood for years outside the doors that opened not unto their pleas or tears I stand outside and knock my own beloved one here before your door now locked let me in some had thought perchance that my heart had no door at all but rather was surrounded by a cold and endless wall but my love did wait impatiently inside that door till you how easily it opened them to let your love pass through I stand outside and I knock my own beloved one here before your door now locked please let me in Revelation 3 20 Jesus said behold I stand at the door and I knock if anyone do what hear my voice can I tell you something if you want to hear from God and you've never heard from God the first thing you're going to hear from God is Jesus saying let me in let me in I love you I've died for you let me in that is the first word you'll ever hear and if you've never heard it before hear it today he's saying I want to come into your life I don't want you just to go to church I want you to go to heaven I don't want you to come to church I want you to come to saving knowledge of who I am but it starts with you allowing me to be your savior recognize you're a sinner and letting me be the Christ the lord of your life have you done that because that's where true eternal life begins John in this chapter has given us three tests of how to know whether or not somebody is a true or a false teacher we", "can call the first one the theological do they confess the Divine Lord is what they say about Jesus accurate the behavioral test do they possess themselves the Divine Life are they living it out not perfectly but genuinely there's reality of their life they've changed and then the biblical test do they recognize God's Divine Law do they recognize the scripture you might put it this way who do they say Jesus is how do they live their lives and what relationship do they have with the word of God are they accepting it are they listening to it and not just hearing you know when Jesus said let him who has ears to hear hear what the spirit is saying to the church he's not just saying listen to it it means obey are you listening to the word of God giving it its Authority in your life that if God you say it then it doesn't matter what anybody else says preacher or or Heathen it doesn't matter what I want or my friends or my family or my Christian friends you said it therefore I accept it and I submit to it and with the power of your spirit and your help I want to obey it the child of God recognizes the authority of God in their life through the word of God as the final judge let's pray father I thank you that you equip us as your children through your teaching of the word of God that scripture is inspired and it's profitable for our correction and our training and righteousness and Lord we want to be men and women who love the Bible know the Bible read the Bible but most especially live the Bible and Lord when it comes to recognizing false teachers we want to be equipped and even better equipped but Lord our goal isn't to run around and be heresy hunters and pointing out all the false teachers as though that makes us the genuine article because we can point Lord we want to speak the truth but we want to do it in love but Lord if there's anyone here who questions their own salvation because as they examine themselves they don't see Christ in them they don't recognize not because there may be Doctrine is deficient but because their life has never changed they've always been who they are they would say I've always just been from this world I've never been born from above Lord would you open their hearts today out of your loving knocking at their door to hear you say Let Me In may they open that door from the inside", "that their lives might be changed forever thank you that you give us the words of eternal life you teach us how to live in this life and to get ready for the soon coming eternal life so fill us with your spirit glorify yourself through your Saints in Jesus name I pray amen let's all stand we'll close the room on the far right side of the room that is just for you if you have any needs for prayer maybe you want them praying for somebody else and you're you're seeking healing of a relationship or a problem in your life just encourage you get some prayer but specifically today if you're hearing you're saying you know I'm not really sure where I stand with the Lord and you brought up some things that troubled me then come and get prayer for that listen uh if you're new I want to meet you if you have time I'll be in the courtyard if I've never met you come come meet me out there just for a few minutes and folks I know this there are people who are never going to do that but you can catch them so I don't mean in a weirdo hi you know be weird about it uh just love them just encourage them and if you have somebody in your life here with you or maybe it's not here but you're not sure where they stand with Jesus talk to them about what we talked about today say who is Jesus to you and don't settle for the right biblical answers obviously oh he's the son of God he rose with talk to them about this test of their life and their way they're walking I think the greatest need for the church today is to wake up to righteousness to living out their faith in their life on Wednesday night God put a message in my heart maybe some of you who weren't here should go listen to it but I really believe God's word for his own people through our study of Balaam 23 000 in one day died 23 000 because of compromise and I wonder how many Believers have are destroying their families destroying their witness and they're Believers they're safe people but the Lord's discipline is on them their blessing can't be on them because of compromise and so if this is one of the evidences that we're really saved it's not going to get you saved because you start being obedient it's going to allow God to start blessing your life and using you in ways that he can't right now so don't", "don't allow just church attendance and correct Doctrine to set don't be satisfied with that say Lord I want my life to reveal your life and if I need to die more to myself and I guarantee you you do say Lord help me to die help me to die it's a funny thing it says we're to take up our cross you know what try to crucify yourself it's kind of a problem if I get one hand down it's like uh somebody help me with the other you can't do it yourself you're gonna need you say Bob are you trying to help me no I'm not going to do it for you but the Lord will help you the Lord will help you to know how do I die to myself Lord hey God bless you have a wonderful week", "after him for the right reasons let's pray Lord we want to be here for the right reason we want to see seek you for the right reason we want to honor you not just because we have problems and we do have them that need to be resolved we need your help and I I thank you that you're a very present help in time of need you you you want our situations and our circumstances to bring us to you but Lord we want to find you to be the answer for more than just the needs that we have you are our savior you are our King you are the the judge and you are the creator of this universe and you have every right to every breath that we breathe because you gave it to us to begin with so Lord we want to Humble ourselves and learn more about you today we invite you to be the Lord of this service the Lord Of Our Lives the Lord of this church Jesus we're going to be celebrating soon your coming the first time as king and we look forward to the day that you come back to be the king of kings the Lord of lords and you come with us who know you help us to study your word with that in mind in Jesus name amen you can be seated what we call Palm Sunday is a day so important that the Holy Spirit inspired not one not two not three but all four gospel writers to cover it um Matthew Mark Luke and John each in their own way talk about what happened on this day a week before Jesus would rise from the dead the week that he would be betrayed the week that he would die on that cross and this day is really described in the Old Testament prophetically so important it was that Daniel actually in 9 uh prophesies the very day that Jesus would come into Jerusalem did you know that he described exactly when Jesus the Christ would come in the day Zechariah quoted uh in our text today and in the other gospels um while he did not prophesy the very day he prophesied the very way that the Messiah would come in riding on a donkey and so a lot is written in Scripture uh about this day that we want to kind of unpack from the Gospel of John you would think because the Lord described the day and the way it'd be impossible for anyone to miss it and it seems like when you read the text", "well Israel was ready they're using the right words and they seem to really be embracing Jesus as the Christ and yet we know that Jesus wept while those people rejoiced while they were celebrating him coming in using these incredible words hosana blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord in reality something was very very wrong it's called in many of our Bibles uh the triumphal entry a a entry of Triumph is a Roman celebration after a victory that had its own procession very special kind of a way to come back into Rome so that General could be honored and the the people that they took prisoners that are slaves now could be paraded about and big floats and so this is called the triumphal Christ it didn't feel like it if you looked at Jesus who was weeping over Jerusalem not a triumphal entry more of a tragic ending for the nation of Israel I've quoted and many of you who have been here for years know that sometimes I've made reference to that uh ride of Paul River come listen my children and you will hear of the midnight of Paul River how he says in that poem the fate of a nation was writing that night and the fate of a Nation really was writing this day in history for Israel because of the decision that Israel was making and failing to make it would not only end up with Jesus on the cross but Jerusalem being destroyed by the Romans in 70 AD and Jesus could see you know I I like to say Jesus wept at two funerals he wept at lazarus's funeral but he wept at the future Jerusalem as people are celebrating and couldn't be happier Jesus was sobbing because he could see the reality of the poor reception the failure to really receive him for who he was and so we want to look at this soberly not just celebrating that Jesus came into Jerusalem fulfilling the prophecy but saying Lord what can we learn about the mistakes that were made because this was the day that you intended your people to receive you and they didn't they didn't do it they were there but they didn't do it there are people here who are saying the right things but Lord are we making that same mistake I don't want to make that mistake so if you fill in the blanks a lot of you are many receive Christ who won't remain with Christ many receive Christ who won't remain with him on the next day now John is giving us remember this is written", "many years now after Matthew Mark and Luke are already written John knew what the other guys we call them the synoptic gospels synoptic Sy YN is from the Greek soon which means together optic to see in Matthew Mark and Luke 10 to look at the same events pretty similarly Luke a little different but Matthew and Mark very much the same and so those are called the synoptics very similar but John writing years later is adding details that were not included knowing that they were not included and so he focuses in on this day and he adds things that they didn't one of those here in verse 12 on the next day is the context of Palm Sunday that John wants to remind us of because Matthew Mark and Luke didn't tell us about it in connection with what had happened the day previous day Jesus was in Bethany and it was there remember that that woman Mary she in judas's mind wasted her perfume to pour it out on Jesus and he criticized her the other gospel writers tell us it wasn't just Judas but Judas seems to have been the mouthpiece why this big waste that could have been sold for 300 you know pieces of silver and it could have been given to the poor and that's what we're all about and remember Jesus said let her alone let her alone she's done me a good deed she's preparing my body keeping my this is for burial very interesting statement in other words she seems to know I've come to die and so you're dishonoring her but in reality Judas you're not concerned about the poor you don't love the poor your problem is a love of money you want to get out that money that it might have brought in this is all talked about right before what a contrast between these two Mary and Judas Judas who's about to betray Jesus though he appears to be a follower a true follower of Jesus many receive Christ who won't remain with him jot down Luke 8: 13 remember in the parable of the soils he spoke about seed that fell on the rocky soil and he then told us what those were he said they are those who hear and receive the word or the gospel with joy they receive it and these have no firm root they believe for a while and in time of Temptation or trial same word they fall away sometimes you'll meet someone I have met many who have said know I used to be a Christian I used to be one of you guys", "more I think Christianity has plenty of wannabes but no hasb not really when somebody says I used to be a Christian I just realized they've never been a Christian and you say Bob why do you say that I went to church I believed but I fell away listen here's what John writes they went out from us because they were never really of us if they had been of us they would have remained with us but they went out from us that it might become manifest that they were never really of us to begin with Jesus will say to those people when he judges them in the sheep goat judgment who were sure they were saved oh depart from me you workers of iniquity I what not I used to know you thought it was nice knowing you never knew you you claim to know me but the fact is all that outward religious stuff that you did among my people wasn't genuine because there was no true repentance in your heart many do go through the motions of receiving Christ who won't remain with him put this down many come to Christ after hearing that he's coming again or he's coming soon in our text what was it that got people excited well on the next day the large crowd who had come to the feast when they heard Jesus was coming to Jerusalem they got excited so they're coming to Jesus as he's coming to town now coming to Christ is a biblical term Jesus used it so we don't want to down remember he said come to me all who are weary and heavy laden I'll give you rest he said come to me if you're thirsty come to me this is what he calls us to do to come to him Spurgeon said faith in Christ is simply and truly described as coming to him it it's not feet it is simply a coming to Christ it's not an exercise of profound mental faculties it's coming to Christ a child comes to his mother a blind man comes to his home even an anim comes to his master coming is a very simple action indeed it seems to have only two things about it one is to come away from something and the other is to something have you come to Christ oh I'm not asking if you've come to church I can see you have you come to Christ when was that what was the effect of it was it actually a coming and putting your faith in him excited expectation which is what we see in this", "crowd of what's going to happen does not equal true Readiness for Christ's coming the fact is there are multitudes of people that think they're ready for the Lord's coming who are self deceived that's true then that's true now Amos 18-2 listen to what the prophet said alas you who are longing for the day of the Lord for what purpose will the day of the Lord be to you it'll be darkness and not light as when a man flees from a lion and a bear meets him that's a bad day or goes home leans his hand against the wall and a snake bites him will not the day of the Lord be darkness in instead of light even Gloom with no it in other words God's people of the Old Testament were waiting for the Messianic Kingdom to come we want the Messiah to come we want the kingdom to come we want the day of the Lord where where God will judge the Nations and Amos with the spirit of God is saying you are not ready for the coming of the Lord that's why Jesus came to his people he said repent he didn't say to the Nations repent be like Israel he said Israel repent the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand you're not ready the people who think they're most ready you're not ready for the Messiah to come remember they thought hey we're children of Abraham if there's anybody on the planet that's ready it's us and Jesus or John the Baptist was not impressed he said God can raise up from these Stones children onto Abraham you need to repent and bring forth fruit don't just go through the baptism the ceremony you need to have a change of life cuz your life doesn't reflect true repentance so many come to to Christ after hearing he's coming soon I I have noticed over the years I got saved in in 1971 that was at kind of the beginning for a lot of excitement about studying about the Lord's coming I can't wait to study the Book of Revelation but I'm also very aware of how many people are very get very excited about that book and about the fact that Christ is coming but we can fall into that same trap we're ready for you to come because we get excited about what it's going to mean we should be excited don't get me wrong the Bible tells us we should be but if he doesn't come in your time then what does your life do then how many came to Christ because they thought", "the Rapture was going to happen in the walked away from the Lord put this down many seek to be saved but from what in our text I want us to look at what they did and what they said this crowd this multitude took the branches of the palm trees now you might underline it I know it's Palm Sunday but if it weren't for John we wouldn't be calling it Palm Sunday they took branches of the palm trees and they went out to meet him and they begin to shout as we just sang Hosanna blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord even the king of Israel now when we sing hosana we don't translate it we just sing it many of us grow have grown up singing hosana you know sometimes we get just used to words and we just kind of I don't know I grew up this way we think we know what they mean I remember as a kid growing up when we would sing about SEO and I thought that meant lord of the Sabbath because it sounded like Sabbath Sabo has nothing to do with the Sabbath just sounds like it sabot means hosts or or armies in the Hebrew but it sounded like Sab to me as a kid so the lord of the Sabbath when we sing hosana blessed is he who hosana in the highest it's almost like is it doesn't that mean praise the Lord oh no no no it does not mean that at all we'll explain what it means in a minute the word itself though it's important you understand simply means save now save now and it's biblical they use very biblical words when Jesus was coming in they Ed the right words to describe who Jesus is by the way even so much quoting Psalm 118 Jesus himself said to the Jewish leadership of the nation that was rejecting him you will not see me again until you say blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord we know these are the right words Jesus made it very clear that they are the right words and so they're honoring him they're describing him as the Messiah they even perform the right actions we know from the other gospels that they they took their garments remember they laid them down in the road and they put their garments on top of the donkey and then they put Jesus on the donkey what was symbolizing that they saw him as their King 2 Kings 9:13 if you're taking notes Old Testament the men then hurried and each", "man took His Garment and placed it under yahu on the bare steps and blew the trumpet saying yahu is King it was the inauguration ing of King Yu or J however you want to say it he was becoming their King and it was a symbol of saying my life my garment is I'm supporting you I'm I'm part you know you're my king and and so this is what the people of Israel were doing they were taking off their putting come over I I'm supporting you as my king you see I'm registered to vote for you you're my guy nothing wrong with that it's kind of a picture I think of somebody who prays to receive Christ and says man I want to be baptized like we'll do right after right after Easter I I want to surrender my life praise the lord it's it's everything about what they were doing was perfect except it's interesting that John wants us to know something that Matthew Mark and Luke do not mention and that was that they used branches if it wasn't for John we wouldn't be celebrating Palm Sunday we might be celebrating coat Sunday or Branch Sunday cuz it does say they took leafy branches but remember there Jesus is coming down the Mount of Olives not the Mount of palm trees now these weren't just natural occurring trees there they had to go get these and it's important enough that John wants us to know they used palm trees now why is the Palm so important well first of all it has some B Testament Feast of Tabernacles they were to use palm branches in the Book of Revelation those that are saved or holding palm branches so it is a symbol of salvation but it was a known symbol of Victory even in the Roman world and in the Greek World symbol of Victory and Triumph and rejoicing a palm branch was given to Victorious athletes in ancient Greece but this particular tradition among the Jewish people actually began a couple of hundred years before this a Greek ruler by the name of Antiochus epiphanies actually Syrian ruler this guy was so blasphemous that when he came to Jerusalem he slaughtered a pig in the holy of holies and made the priests drink its blood he absolutely bludgeoned the Jews into submission and after several years of that kind of behavior a man arose by the name of Judas makabe by the way his name means hammer and his brothers and him decided to if you will nail Antiochus epiphanies by launching a Guerilla war against him approximately 9 years later when Judas", "overcame the Assyrian army they drove epiphanies from Jerusalem the people of spontaneously celebrated by waving palm branches and from that time on the back of Jewish coinage by the way to this very day if you're familiar uh depicts a palm branch as a symbol of deliverance oppression you need to understand John wants us to know they were holding up palm branches and they were saying save now essentially the crowd was saying overthrow the Roman yoke politically help us out economically lead us militarily save now if if palm branches were signs they would have pretty much said get ready to rumble strike back at the Empire send Rome home make Israel great again they were not asking for an altar it was a call to Arms it was a message it it's no wonder then that when Jesus came into Jerusalem the whole city was stirred the word is sco in Greek we get a word seismic as in earthquake the whole town was stirred because of this crowd Around Jesus and they were asking who is this and they said oh he's the prophet from Nazareth come into town but what everybody that was a Jew expecting Messiah would have believed is when he comes into town he's going to head straight for the Antonio Fortress that oversaw the temple that's the Garrison of the Romans that they built right there because they didn't trust the Jews even to worship God these Troublesome Jews he's going to head straight for that Garrison and he's going to he's going to deal with the Romans and they were shocked when Jesus comes into Jerusalem and you know where he went he went straight into the temp Temple to deal with the Jews and he cleansed the temple overturning the tables for the second time that did not make sense to any of them and when the people of his day realized Jesus had a completely different agenda than a political one A different agenda than a national one A different agenda than a material one the cry changed from hosan by the end of the week to crucify him within just a few days those two on the road to Emmas depressed though Jesus is Alive they don't know it we thought it was he who was going to deliver Israel he didn't come through you see the same is really still true in our day Christians individually and churches corporately they mobilize politically for this cause or that personality to change our government or to change our economy but very few are really interested in a cross that speaks of dying to self there's an interesting", "picture of Calvary that depicts three empty crosses on golgatha with a donkey in the background chewing on a pal front see it's one thing to shout at a parade it's something else altogether to stand at the foot of the cross but that happens throughout church history it happens in our day people come to Christ with an agenda save now save my marriage save my business save this friendship save me from this disease like Jesus is a is a good luck charm can I tell you that if you just come to him to help you B based on what you think you need you need help financially maybe you do or physically or socially or whatever it is you'll probably be disappointed when things don't go the way you thought that they should you see when we realize that Jesus came to die for our sin and pay the price for our iniquity our conclusion ought to be I hope it is for you if he never does anything else in this life presently that's more than enough to Merit my loyalty my affection and my devotion eternally if he never does another thing for me if he never gives another blessing to me I owe him my life because of what he already did at Calvary amen I think of what Jacob said as he crossed the river to come home he said when I crossed this River the first time all I had was a staff was by myself wasn't married no kids no money really not sure what the future was going to hold but now I'm I look at what God's done in my life my sons and the cattle and the blessings of God then he said I am not worthy of the least of his mercies my cup is running over he didn't know me anything but he gave me so much more than I ever put in this word disappointed God says in the Bible he who believes on him will be disappointed that's Romans 10:11 quoting the Old Testament Romans 10 and verse 11 in fact it's quoted not just by Paul and Romans but also by Peter for the scripture Old Testament says whoever believes in Messiah will not not be disappointed do you know we are never told in the New Testament that I can find if you can find it I'll accept it but we are never told to believe in Jesus you say well wait a minute I know a lot of passages that say that well in English but not in Greek Greek has a word for in it's n en", "but it's never in Greek believe in Jesus Jus we are told to believe into Jesus and we are told at times like Romans 10:11 to believe on Jesus two words I do believe there's plenty of people who believe things about Jesus they're accurate like this crowd they're saying all the right things their profession was perfect it was Orthodox the problem is have you put your faith on him have you believed into H I do believe if you've come to the Lord if you've received the Lord with expectations that were nothing he promised but were things you expected him to do let me just say this if you disappointed you may have confidence that you believed in who he was but you can have God's word on this that you didn't really believe in him the way you needed to if you were disappointed because he who believes on him will not be disappointed so I challenge you if you feel like he didn't measure up he didn't save me from my drug addiction he didn't save me from smoking he didn't save me from swearing he didn't save my marriage we got a divorce he didn't save me from Christ received his name the angel said You shall call his name Jesus because he will save his people and we weren't even those by the way most of us from their sins put this down letter B Jesus comes lowly in verse 14 Jesus finding a young donkey sat on it and he quotes the Old Testament passage that tells how the Messiah will come fear not Daughter of Zion behold your king is coming but he's Seated on a Colt and then John adds these words these things his disciples did not understand at the first but when Jesus was glorified he's talking about the resurrection then they remembered that these things were written of him and they had had done him in the book The Art of being a big shot the writer says it's my pride that makes me independent of God it's appealing to me to feel that I am the master of my fate that I run my own life call my own shots I go it alone but that feeling is basic dishonesty I can't go it alone I have to get help from other people and I am ultimately I ultimately write rely I can't rely on myself I'm dependent on God for my next breath it's dishonest of me to pretend that I'm anything but a man small weak and limited so living independent of God is really self- delusion it's not just a matter of Pride", "being an unfortunate little trade and humility being an attractive little virtue it's my inner psychological integrity that's at stake when I'm conceited I'm lying to myself about what I am I am pretending to be God and not man my pride is the idolatrous worship of myself and that is the national Jesus comes in humbly put this down don't miss the quiet message of the you see it wasn't just that Jesus would come in on a donkey actually the donkeys were very common means of transportation was like donkey I was like there were donkeys everywhere maybe there were some faster donkeys in the diamond lane I don't know but there were donkeys everywhere that was what Jews rode very common now Jesus walked normally we don't read of him on a donkey ever boat walking this one danad um so it was significant but it's significance is much more than that it is a cult of a donkey a well a baby donkey now when I went to Israel the first time 1990 I went with Hal Lindsay and a bunch of people it was great trip but when we were up on the Mount of Olives some of you have been with us us and you've been up on the Mount of Olives and when you're up there and the buses come in all the guys who sell stuff come out and you know they bring the camel if you want to go on a camel ride well it's really a camel turnaround ride you don't get to go very far but you know for five or 10 bucks or whatever you can do that and they're trying to sell maps and all but it's a beautiful view of of the old city of Jerusalem so it's a place everybody wants to go but the year I went 1990 there was a guy who came with a white donkey and who doesn't want to ride down the you know Palm Sunday road which is what it's called this ancient road on the road that Jesus rodee the donkey and so how Lindsay paid whatever it was and he rode the donkey down that Steep Hill um but it was interesting um his feet were dragging on the ground on that donkey and it was not a baby donkey so you you need to see Jesus on a this is not just a regular donkey this is a donkey nobody nobody's afraid you know we we sometimes get a mini donkey for our our our kids when for on Palm Sunday because they're so cute you know I just", "take that one home fit my car I mean small not a terrifying sight but when the Bible says that Jesus came in on a donkey it is teaching us about his nature his character your king comes to you humbly he's even riding on a a baby heard the story two geese were about to start on their annual migration when they met a frog who begged to be taken along the geese said okay if you can think of a way that we can manage it though the Frog produced a long stock of grass and suggested that each Goose hold it at opposite ends and that he would cling to it by his mouth in the middle in this manner the geese were heading south when they were noticed by a man below the Observer expressed admiration for the clever maneuver of the frog that was holding on who thought of such a brilliant idea the Frog was so puffed up over the compliment that he opened his mouth and said me and so they wrote when you have a good thing going don't be so eager to take credit it's best to keep your mouth the Bible says um even a fool when he keeps his mouth shut is wise there's an old saying that says uh it's better to be thought a Fool by keeping silent than opening your mouth and removing all doubt I don't know why I'm thinking about frogs these days but um well I do know why we we have a frog we discovered him her it um couple of weeks ago you couldn't miss you couldn't miss him because he's noisy I mean he's loud and uh we thought he'd go away after a day or two oh no no no this frog likes living next to my house and lives in this well somewhere out there because he's kind of hard to find and but he's loud I mean loud hard to sleep with this frog doing its thing or two frog I think there's two there's too many is what there I think he's waking up our um so loud we finally just went out there to find this giant frog it was this tiny little thing is about this big I think how could anything be that loud and we you know we even moved him to another area oh no he's back he knows his way around my backyard to get from the uh so I said Alexa how long do frogs live oh from 1 to 8 years I thought not one cuz we need it is it's loud Jesus comes in", "quietly listen when he came in as the king the first time he didn't come in on a white horse the first time that's reserved for coming because at his first coming he's coming in as the Lamb of God who's going to take away the sins of the world and like a lamb that is silent before it shears he said nothing when he comes in the second time he won't be coming back as the Lamb of God he'll be coming back as the lion of the tribe of Judah amen and every eye will see him and he will be on a white horse don't miss the quiet message Jesus comes in low to save he comes in to save all who are all who recognize they've been brought Low by their sin remember Jesus said blessed are those who are mourning now people misunderstand that to somehow mean if you're really going through a hard time it's a good thing that's not what it means it's talking about when he said blessed are the poor doesn't mean I don't feel like it's that big of a blessing to be out of money blessed are the poor in spirit blessed literally are the bankrupt who recognize I have nothing to offer God for theirs the Kingdom of Heaven he gives it for free and blessed then are those who mourn for their sin is the idea that's what James says come you wealthy people howl and weep for the your judgments coming on you we need to be those people who recognize God I don't deserve to be saved at all and I do grieve my sin and I want to be saved from it but he comes in low to save all who have been brought low Isaiah 57 and 15 Isaiah 57 for thus saith the high and the exalted one who lives forever whose name is Holy I dwell on high and a holy place and also with the contrite and the lowly of Spirit in order to revive the spirit of the lowly and to revive the heart of the contrite when Jesus came into Jerusalem on a baby donkey oh yeah there was a big crowd and people were shook up in town but really there was no shock and awe to him ride I don't think the Roman Garrison was afraid oh what's he going to do they weren't shivering in their sandals when Jesus was born it was hardly noticed by the only ones who came to his birthday had to be invited by the angels and those were those humble Shepherds you know when he comes into", "life all of our testimonies are slightly different I know that but for me I didn't even know he had come into my I've told you before you wouldn't have either not at first I I had no awareness it but he was in my life thankfully I didn't expect there to be some big change otherwise maybe I would have been disappointed man I prayed the prayer and now I'm supposed to feel something and nothing I had come to him by faith he'd come into my life by faith I knew or would come to know what he had promised behold I stand at the door and I knock if anyone opens the door hears my voice and opens the door I will come guaranteed and eventually I would start having fellowship with him but the Lord does really I think people sometimes are afraid well if I become a Christian I I can't do it amen neither could we stop worrying about that well I'm not sure if I'm cut out to be a Christian you you're a sinner right yes you need saving right yes you're cut out to be a qualify always sad when we have communion some I'm not taking communion this week cuz I had a bad week well who do you think it's for the people who live the perfect life celebrating their savior it's for sinners now if you're holding on to your sin I wouldn't take it Paul has some things to say about that to the Corinthians but if you're ready to admit it and repent of it man but I I think Satan he's a liar isn't that what Jesus said in John 8 whenever he talk he just lies you never know anybody there's lies that's all the you just got come something comes out of the mouth lie another lie that's Satan's character and I think it's some times the character of somebody who's so afraid people won't accept them won't love them they make up things exaggerate things but one of Satan's lies is oh man you'll fail as a Christian guess what I'll just tell you now you'll fail as a Christian guaranteed you'll fail to live up to Perfection as a Christian that's the good news his mercies are new this morning and they wouldn't be provided if there was no need I need it this morning and I will probably the last day that the day I go to heaven I'll need it too it's not okay I'm not saying because it's available that's permission to sin what does Paul say shall we sin that Grace might abound", "no but I'm no fool to think that some how I'm going to live at some perfect level don't you think that about me because I'm up here well he must live a perfect you don't know no come up I'll sin right in front of you no I'm just kidding the fact is I sin I need a savior and here's my conviction the longer I'm a Christian the more saving I realize I need not the less well don't you sin less I don't know maybe maybe I'm just aware of more of my sinful nature that's always there I don't know but I don't come place like well I sure hope you can come to this place of amazing Christian Living that mastered wow sick even coming out of my mouth put this down many seek to meet Jesus hoping to see a miracle that's still true verse 17 so the people who were with Jesus notice this when he called Lazarus out of the Tomb that's John 11 that's the resurrection of Lazarus they were at the funeral and when Jesus raised him from the dead they continued to testify about Christ and for this reason also the people went and they met Jesus because they heard he had sign I call this the Lazarus effect Luke 238 it wasn't just this crowd that felt this way about Jesus now it says remember Jesus at his trial pilate found out where he was from and said oh good I can Pawn this one off you know I remember as a police officer if a accident happened right on the border I mean literally every time two agencies respond they get out the rollee to their border ours you called it kissing it off yeah that's in the other jurisdiction see you going 108 I'm done that's just uh unfortunately the way people are pilate was no different it's like I don't really feel like dealing with this Jesus guy you're from herod's territory awesome send him to Herod and Herod was actually glad to have it this is what it says Luke 238 now Herod was very glad when he saw Jesus for he had wanted to see him for a long time because he had been hearing about him and was hoping to see some sign him well if you remember what happens Jesus does nothing of a miracle doesn't even say anything to him so Herod wanted to meet Jesus but he too was disappointed cuz he was looking for sign remember those that were looking for miracles from Jesus which was constant CU they heard about him or", "they met people who said he did one in their life and so many people do a miracle do a sign and Jesus said an evil and adulterous generation is Seeking a miracle no sign will be given to it except the sign of Jonah the resurrection is what he was referring to Herod wanted to sign not a savior he wanted to witness a spectacle he certainly did not want to surrender crown remember when the WIS men come from the East because they had seen this star and knew that there was one born King of the Jews and they come they come Jerusalem and they don't know exactly where messiah's to be born so they come and they talk to the king they talk to Herod different Herod by the way that they want to know where is the Messiah going to be born and Herod doesn't really know but he asks the Bible guys the scribes and they said well according to Micah 52 that'd be Bethlehem because of that prophecy but the Bible says when Herod heard the Messiah might be born it says he was troubled and all Jerusalem him why How could somebody be born the king of the Jews when that's what my says the throne only has one seat and it in other words people get excited about some spectacle some miracle that Jesus might do and they just want to know if he's able to do it and clearly disappointed and then it says that in verse 19 the Pharisees said to one another you see that you are not doing any good look the world has gone after him but I personally think what was freaking out the Pharisees actually demons you say what do you mean well when the world goes after Jesus that should tell you something because there are times when Jesus can become very popular in history and in culture and in communities John 6 and verse1 15 though says this so Jesus perceiving that the crowd was intending to come and take him by force to make him their King politically he withdrew again to a mountain Alone by himself Jesus really was never popularity in the gospel of Mark chapter 1 in verse 37 and 38 we read about the disciples because they were looking for Jesus he had gone out early in the morning to pray but Mark 137 and 38 they finally find him it says they were literally hunting for Jes they couldn't find him he was out having prayer time they found him and they said to him everyone is looking for you King James everyone seeks you that's", "actually true whether people know it or not they're looking for Jesus they don't know it but they said everyone in town is looking for you he just done a whole night of healing by the way in the gospel of Mark everybody was excited in the morning where's Jesus and they couldn't find him CU Jesus was out having a quiet time and so the disciples says everyone's looking for you and then Jesus said let us go somewhere else not to the people that are looking let us go somewhere else to the towns nearby so that I may preach there also for that is what I came for or literally what I came out of my quiet time for interesting here's a big huge exciting crowd that wants to celebrate who Jes Jesus is and he says I'm going somewhere else crowd and then John 2: 23-25 now when he was in Jerusalem at the Passover during the feast many believed in his name observing his miracles which he was doing but Jesus on his part was not entrusting himself to them for he knew all men and because he did not need anyone to testify concerning man for he himself knew what was in man interesting couple of takeaways before we close put this down as a Believer or as a person who's interested in Jesus don't look for a miracle be a miracle don't look for a miracle be a miracle you know it's interesting that Lazarus the raising of Lazarus was this big draw well we can understand that and John goes out of his way to tell us how important the resurrection of Lazarus was to the Palm Sunday crowd the size of the crowd was affected by this miracle that raised Lazarus from the dead what's interesting about Lazarus if you go back and read his life Lazarus actually never word you don't have a single word I'm not saying he never talked I'm just saying the in the Bible but yet he's a witness Jesus would do the teaching he do the speaking and the preaching but Lazarus was proof of the pudding so to speak because listen to me witnessing is not just what you say it's who you are it's what you are you know it's interesting many people get this one wrong but Jesus didn't commission us as Believers to go into all the world and witness he said You shall be my Witnesses you said well what do you mean well here's the the difference it's as if Jesus said like Lazarus you were dead your countenance was drab you R of the", "Grave you were bound up in all sorts of stuff but I freed you and now you will be my Witnesses because people will look at the difference in you and they'll be me Samuel Chadwick Methodist evangelist and educator in the 1900 said this quote if God is at work week by week raising men from the dead there will always be people coming to see how it's done you cannot find an empty church that has conversion as its leading feature do you want to know how to fill empty chapels here is the answer get your Lazarus he said well I say better yet be the example be the proof that Jesus Christ is alive from the dead because of what he's done in your life this is what your kids need to see your neighbors need to see your boss needs to see you will be my Witnesses and then finally the one day God calls you to receive today is today will you jot down the passage the broader passage that was quoted by the crowds in all four gospels Psalm 118 veres 22- 24 here's what Jesus is quoting from the stone which the builders rejected and Jesus Will quote this elsewhere in the gospels the stone which the builders rejected has become the chief Cornerstone this is the Lord's doing it's marvelous in our eyes this is the day which the Lord has made let us rejoice and be glad in now I don't know why we separate that out I mean we have songs this is the day this is the day I I don't want to ruin that song because I think we can celebrate the Lord every day but in context the day that the Lord has made was Palm Sunday the day that Messiah came in the day that he comes into your life that's the day that we are to celebrate you see when it says the stone which the builders rejected there's actually an old Jewish legend that when Solomon built the temple you remember that the Bible tells us there in the book of kings that the stones for the temple were all precut David was given the pattern he collected the materials Solomon then had the the stones cut but they were cut in a Quarry outside of Jerusalem and then transported there the idea is they didn't want all the noise there was to be no noise uh the chisling of the Hammers in the holy city so that had all be done elsewhere in the Quarry and then shipped over so every stone was perfectly measured perfectly cut and", "placed in the place if you've been with us to see you can't see the the temple itself but even the foundation Stones amazing miraculously put together without mortar perfectly fit but this old Jewish Legend said that when they started to build the temple they started doing work on it Stones were being sent over by the Quarry and one stone came they they they they thought it was a mistake that this isn't right and so they actually just pushed it over into the Kidron Valley between the Mount of Olives and the Temple Mount they just got rid of it as a mistake and they continued to build continued to build until finally it was time for that Chief Cornerstone to be put into place and and they said send it over and the quy said we already did they said we never got it they said we said it really early cuz it was so important they said that oops and that's the background they said from this verse the stone which the Jesus the Chief Cornerstone rejected by the builders has become the Chief Cornerstone in its glorious and our in other words the Jews rejected their Messiah by the way they did that on Palm Sunday but as Zechariah said they will look upon me whom they have pierced and they will mourn for him as One Mourns for an only son and Romans tells us that all Israel eventually will be saved we'll study in the Book of Revelation about the cealing of the 144,000 and those are not Jehovah's Witnesses by the way but jot down Luke 19 and verse 42 I want you to miss this here's what Jesus said as he was weeping over Jerusalem this day if thou Hast known even thou at least in this notice this phrase thy day in this this is your day the things that belong for peace but now they have been hidden from your eyes they seem to be rejoicing as they're receiving Christ as king yet in reality they missed their appointed day him remember seeing a cartoon years ago it showed Noah's Ark with all the animals on it sailing away and two dinosaur on an island talking to each other because you know dinosaurs do that and one said dang was that today somebody wrote this the truth rode into Jerusalem on a donkey's back the majority did not not want the truth that day nor have they wanted the truth on day since that day when it comes to Jesus Christ you have to make a decision you have to either receive him", "or reject him it's possible to go through all the Motions it's possible to say the right words it's possible to call him and recognize he is the Messiah use biblical words go through a ceremony where you're surrendering your life it all looks like that was a perfect sinner's prayer you prayed but what have you done with Jesus when he's disappointed you have you walked away from him a decision you say well I've never really made a decision well to not decide is to decide to say not now is really to say no it's not enough to be interested or even excited about Jesus Millions of people who are interested in him have no living relationship with him at all the people on the first Palm Sunday were interested the whole city was stirred up to the point of discussion but not to the point of true action an interest in Jesus will save no one the gospel only saves those who believe not those who talk about believing spiritual neutrality is a temporary orary Way Station not a permanent destination no one stays there forever it was kirkgard who said this one either believes in him or is offended by him ultimately that's what it comes down to there is a time to think and a time to decide a time to be silent the Bible says in eclesiastes and a time to speak a time to discuss and a time to make up your mind the reason some people never see the truth is not that they have not read enough books or do not have degrees but they lack courage to accept Jesus for who he is and what it's going to mean for their lives but spiritual opportunities do not last forever here was the day here was the way everything on the outside looked perfect but something inside was wrong have you receive Christ as your lord and savior have you demonstrated that he is your lord when things did not yet work out the way that you are hoping will you say with Peter where else could I go you have the words of eternal life will you say with job even if my flesh might fail I'm going on record in the midst of my pain in the midst of my disappointment and I know that my redeemer lives and I know I'm going to see him on this Earth with my own eyes and though he should slay me yet will I hope in him nothing's going to change my resolve I don't have to understand him to stand upon his", "finished work let's pray Lord I want to ask that you would encourage us today who have made that profession of Faith who have come to you to hold on to you for Lord we know that you describe there would be those who would receive the celebrate and remain temporarily Lord if there's any here who are coming back to you praise you I pray God this Easter many believers who have been distant would come to church and then they would come to Christ but they would stay with you we know Lord true biblical saving Faith continues so help us to hunker down during the storms Lord you have storms that are on your well we don't see them but you you're going to allow them to come so that you can steal some of them but so that you can Ste all of our hearts that will trust you forgive us for our unbelief but Lord strengthen our faith and help us to share our faith help us to be a witness even if we don't open our mouth help help the changes that have gone help us to be the Lazarus Lord to this generation in Jesus name name I pray amen let's all stand sing together can I begin to thank you for all that you've done for me Jesus ofly praise it will take all eternity just like laus oh he brought me back to no longer I to live but Christ in me for I can go Bor again my heart is free the hope of Heaven before the grave Hallelujah you brought me back I no Christ oh I been more again my heart is the hope of Heaven Beed the gra tonight I hope all of us can come out on Good Friday listen there are people who can't come to church with you on Sunday because they've got their own church or their own plans for that weekend but they may not be going anywhere Friday so bring them out as we will focus on the cross but if there's somebody that you know is out of fellowship or doesn't go to church doesn't walk with the Lord invite him to one of the Easter services as I will with God's grace share the gospel whatever the weather is we're going to gather and we're going to celebrate that Jesus Christ is alive from the dead the greatest story that needs to be told and if there are people you love that you want to hear that message and then have an opportunity to respond cuz we'll give them a chance to come forward to receive Christ be", "praying for them and you be the Lazarus you be the one that is a testimony to them that that can be true for them too but invite them you need the boldness of God that's what the Holy Spirit has come to do still time to write someone's name put it in the cross outside and say I'm going to pray for him this week and then you go and pray and then invite him I can't wait to see what God's going to do I just ask you as a congregation be praying for the outpouring of God's spirit and the work of God's word uh through the gospel next weekend God", "Jesus we put no confidence in the flesh let's pray lord here we are to start a new week a new day we've got some of the same problems from this past week and we've got new ones coming the Lord we want to take this moment out we want to put it on pause kind of stopped everything like you said see striving be still and know that your God and Lord what better way for us to do that than to sit as mary did and listen to the Word of God help us to take that good portion that cannot be taken from us today and that which we need Lord would you restore the joy of your people if any here are believers and are not enjoying all of you that they can and I guess in some way that's probably all of us I ask that you would give us back or give us a fresh a work of the holy spirit that is obvious to everyone around us we love you Lord and we need you so speak to us in jesus name amen you can be seated so Philippians has four chapters you know that or probably could easily figure that out and here we're starting the first verse of the third chapter which means we're right in the middle of the book but he starts with the word finally but there's two chapters to come what's with that little boy he was going with his mom to church every Sunday he would sit listen to the preacher and this preacher would often say now in closing and then he preached for another half hour after two or three times of that happening the little boy was a little flex so he went to his moms and mom what does the phrase now in closing mean when pastor says it in sermon she said absolutely nothing and so you might wonder why is Paul saying finally but he's not closing as he just got some new things after this that he starts talking about and the answer is no the Greek word that is the basis boy class or in the original means now furthermore here in context it's just transitional so Paul's not making a mistake by saying finally he will say it again in chapter 4 verse 8 and there he is actually closing but we're going to talk about kind of a new subject when we've covered in this book the secret of joy you know CS Lewis remember set a gloomy Christian of the contradiction in terms we don't want to be that we want to be a good", "advertisement for the Lord we want people to say what do you got that I need and they can see it rather than we have to tell them because they can't see anything but in Chapter 1 we discovered the power of the Christian life the power of joy really he said for me to live is Christ to die is gain what a great verse if if I'm given be able to say when I die and looking forward to death when I die it's going to be a plus then the first part of that sentence Philippians 1 21 has to be true of you for me to live is Christ that is Christ as in me the hope of glory Paul says and he's living his life through me the power the Christian life is christ in us but we've also discovered the pattern of the Christian life how am I going to live this life out remember Paul says in Philippians 2 verse 5 have this mind in you which was also in Christ you need Christ in you but more than that now you need to live that out what does that mean well he didn't count equality with God a thing to be held on to be emptied himself he took the form of a servant we discovered in this book that if we're willing to humble ourselves and serve sacrificially no matter what we're going through we can still experience joy so we've seen the power of the Christian life it's Christ enough we've seen the of the Christian life it's the mind of Christ in a sense today he's going to introduce what will call the protection of the Christian life but yours the Lord is the protection of the Christian left jot down some 5 and verse 11 Paul says there or paul david says there but let all things all those rejoice who put their trust in you gone let them ever shop for joy because you defend them let those also who love your name be joyful in you there's a relationship between joy and protection there in the book of Nehemiah when the law was open and it was red and everybody was listening the Israel hadn't heard the law in years and when they heard the scriptures read they began to weep you know why they wept because they had missed the Word of God but also because it grieved them because they could see their sin when you read the Bible rightly it will convict you it is like a mirror James says and we see ourselves and we see God we don't like", "the way we look but it's designed to help us to see ourselves you know the labor in the tabernacle and in the temple was a place the priests would wash but there were it was made of mirrors the it was the skin with mirrors the ideas you come up and you can see that you need to be cleansed and then you can be cleansed but the law is a mirror it cannot cleanse you but it can show your need to be cleansed nobody washes their face with the mirror law can't make you clean Christ can make you clean but here's the idea in Nehemiah chapter 8 the people are hearing the Word of God and they're starting to cry they're starting to leap and the leaders say don't cry instead celebrate because the joy of the Lord is your so you know that versed in my eight ten it's the joy of the Lord don't be all bummed out about who you are why because you're going to be vulnerable to the enemy if you let yourself get depressed and discourage you remember when God came to Cain is Genesis chapter 4 and Cain was angry and he was depressed and God says to him why are you angry and why has your countenance fallen well we know why it's because there's brought sacrifice was accepted by God and His was not and God speaks to Cain and he warns him he said if you do well well not your countenance be lifted up that's your face feel your joy will be returned if you do what's right but if you do not do well behold sin is crouching at the door and its desire is for you but you must master it when you lose your joy you are vulnerable to the enemy doing a work in your life that you do not want put this down don't let the dogs take a bite out of your joy put in the word bite if you're doing the outline don't let the dogs take a bite out of your joy how do we do that we'll put this down then number one don't attach your joy to the wrong things boy that's easier to do finally my brethren rejoice don't miss it underline it if you are one who does that kind of thing I do rejoice in the Lord you know Jesus did not just have the twelve apostles who followed him there is an occasion in the Book of Luke where we read of this V now we don't know the names of the 70 but the 70 were", "not just the multitudes they were followers of Jesus they were closer to him and he sent them out to minister so they represented him fact it says there in lieutenant sent out the seventy into every village and city that he himself was going to come to so they were like his four runners but he didn't just send them out to say jesus is coming jesus is coming he sends them out to minister the same way he did you have to this time they just watched Jesus preach the gospel they had watched Jesus heal the sick they had watched Jesus cast demons out but he said the 70 and Luke Tim to do the same thing he said preach the gospel heal the sick cast the demons out and they did and it was a very effective ministry outing they come back and they're rejoicing because they had cast demons out of people and liberated people and i want you to see the response of Jesus it's Luke Tim verse 20 here's what Jesus says to the seventy who come back so so excited nevertheless do not rejoice in this and what well he had said I saw Satan fall to the ground like lightning when you guys were out there he was getting he was getting from but don't rejoice in this that the spirits the demons are subject to you but rejoice that your names are recorded in heaven that's got an interesting statement Jesus why wouldn't we be celebrating people are having demons cast out of them and here's the difference your names are recorded in heaven that's something that's permanent you may not always have such victory in your battle against evil remember Jesus would blow up on another Mount of Transfiguration with Peter James and John he'll come down and his disciples have been trying to cast a demon out of a little boy and they're being unsuccessful and here's the principle for us the Lord wants us to rejoice in him and remember what God says with himself i am the lord i changed not in Hebrews it says of Jesus he's the same yesterday today and forever we can always rejoice in the Lord because he is a constant your circumstances even your ministry may not be but Christ is that's by the way I think why the Old Testament it says to us husbands rejoice in the wife of your youth it doesn't say rejoice in the youth of your wife one is a permanent thing the other one not so much you know i love the worship songs that we sing i", "grew up on the great hymns and i love them as well there is great theology in christian music and much of the songs we sing our scripture or good solid theology however not all the songs that we've ever sung aren't necessarily excellent theology how some of the bad stuff sneaks in there's a song that maybe you like me grew up and maybe was in children's ministry that said the joy of the Lord is our strength that's straight from Scripture that's Nehemiah we just talked about that but in that same song unfortunately it says if you want joy you must clap for it it's like so first because that isn't biblical you want joy you start a clapping it reminds me pastor chuck smith said years ago when he was a little boy he was in church and there was a visiting preacher about the gift of the Holy Spirit and he was sitting up front I guess and this evangelist was walking around in it and he turned and he pointed it at you chuck smith as a boy he said this young man will never receive the Holy Spirit until he learns to raise his hands can I tell you something the joy of the Lord doesn't come by clapping and the Holy Spirit doesn't fall by you raising your hands the joy of the lord of the power of the Holy Spirit comes when you bow your will when you submit your life God wants to do something in you but you're going to have to release who you are for that to happen don't attach your joy to the wrong things put this down number to remember where your joy is rooted where is it once in the text here rejoice in the lord at he says by the way I'm repeating myself and I don't mind repeating myself he's already said it in Chapter one rejoice and again I'll say rejoice it in Chapter four he'll say the same thing rejoice the Lord again this bears repeating because we don't get it often the first time rejoice in the Lord it's not religion it's a relationship the person now I do think there are some Christians to misunderstand this they think well no matter how bad things are I gotta pretend I'm doing okay I ought to pretend I don't care I gotta pretend like I cried because God is God and no I'm not bleeding out you mean we have to it's about deny reality that is not what the Bible teaches some people think it's wrong for a Christian degrees at a memorial service I've watched them oh no", "we're not sorry guys there that's okay are you kidding jesus wept and he was about to raise him from the dead it's okay to cry we're not to weep as those who have no hope like the world does when a believer dies but there is such a thing as good grief there is such a thing as sorrowing that's honorable to the lord by the way but sometimes Christians get this all big stuff this they pretend they're joyful when they're not or they're pretended getting joy out of things that couldn't bring them joy at all it does not say rejoice in your you need to rejoice in his purpose and that he has one doesn't they rejoice it you're suffering we're to rejoice in his sovereignty it's in the Hawker eos the master the Lord remember when John is arrested this is revelation 1 and he's on the island of Patmos that's a rock island like Alcatraz he says he's big he's gonna probably died there as far as he knows he's away from the body of Christ he's an old man he's probably frail at this point in his life he doesn't have people to minister to he's away from everybody that he loves and what he's called to be the deaths where God had put him but it's there in that hard difficult place that he has one of the greatest revelations literally of God and of our future and I often just encourage myself and other people do you feel like you stuck somewhere you don't want to be I don't know how God could use this at all in my life oh well maybe your stories to play it over yet but if you read revelation you'll find that you have a revelation of Jesus in Chapter 12 glorified Christ chapters 2 and 3 his message to the seven churches of Asia and then in Chapter four you have the rapture or something just like it I heard a voice they come up here and suddenly I was in the spirit and he's caught up and he sees heaven John has his Paul moment he's caught up to heaven and here's what I want you to see what is the very first thing that John who's on this desert rock penitentiary what does he see what is the first thing he sees when he gets to have it I'll tell you he sees a throne and he sees one on it you know what that is that's a nice a a moment you remember I say the King has died and it was a good king you know", "sometimes somebody comes into office and we don't know what they're gonna do next okay that's now but but uh Isaiah 6 the king who had brought stability and prosperity and blessing to the nation of Israel for over 50 years one of the longest reigning king uzziah has just died and everybody's thinking what's going to happen next in the year King Uzziah died I guess as I saw the Lord sees a vision sitting on his throne you see yes that earthly throne of Israel is vacant and all the instability and uncertainty that's bringing me but you know what God's on the throne he's in charge and I can see it that's exactly what happened to John and I think it's an important reality we're going to have our joy restored we need to know where its rooted now Paul has been talking about that from the beginning of the book remember he had wanted to go to Rome as a preacher instead he was sent as a prisoner he is in custody he can't go out and preach and he's writing this letter he's letting the Philippians all lunch of the dough though it's not bugging me that I'm in prison in fact there are people that are preaching and they're trying to hurt me by their preaching as though that could hurt me they're doing it out of envy they're trying to rub soap Paul you can't preach but we can and we can convert people that what we believe and Paul says you know I all I know is Christ is being preached more that he was before so I'll rejoice in that he says besides which yes I'm in jail but guess what while I am bound the Word of God is not and might I changed and the cause of Christ they're causing the Saints to be more bold and they're causing soldiers to get saved who would have never heard the gospel the Praetorian Guard are now hearing all about me even Caesars household in my president in other words I see what God's doing through my imprisonment and so I'll rejoice in the sovereignty of God jot down a great passage Habakkuk chapter 3 verses 17 through 19 here's a passage for every one of us may Lord's calling you to meditate on this to believe this let's be done on the screen for a moment let me give you the background have a cook short little book minor prophet what is the what is the context of the book well it is the invasion of the Babylonians hasn't happened yet but Habakkuk knows", "it's going to happen they're coming an evil wind out of the east because it in Chapter 1 they're coming and he begins the booklet I don't get it god I don't understand it here's why the Babylonians ruthless murdering pagan people and he's saying I know israel needs to be disciplined but you're bringing wicked people to discipline your children makes no sense to me and you say God why why do I have to sit by and watch this happen and he says God's not answering you ever felt like something wrong what's going to happen or is happening with God why Eddie doesn't answer you join Habakkuk in chapter one but by the end he gets to this conclusion and it's the conclusion you and I need to get to today about what's going on that we don't understand he ends the book with these three verses verse 17 although the fig tree should not blossom a fig tree that tree that symbolizes Israel and there be no fruit on the vines though the yield of the olives should completely fail and the fields produce no food although the flock should be cut off from the fold and there be no cattle in the stalls complete financial ruin yet I will exalt in the Lord I will rejoice at the God of my salvation I can't rejoice in my circumstances but i can still rejoice in the god of my salvation i'm still saved the lord he's my strength and i love this he has made my feet like Hinds feet and he makes me walk on the high places he won't remove the mountain but he'll give me the ability to get up and over the cliff you see well that's what we need look we all have a different verse 17 we all have a different although for him it had to do with figs and fruit and fields and flocks and that's probably not what's bugging you today my garden is just falling apart maybe we're all going to have different verse 17 different all those but we can all have the same I wills of Chow verse 18 and 19 I will exalt in the Lord I will exalt and magnify the God of my salvation a lot of us all of us need to stop with the how can I get out of this Lord and start with what can get out of this Lord put this down be aware of the dogs beware the does that's verse 2 first four words this is not a warning to mailmen what is he talking about jot down Isaiah 56 10 quite", "possibly what Paul is thinking when he uses the word dogs Isaiah 56 10 here Isaiah is referring to the prophets the false prophets of Israel who are leading God's people astray by not speaking the truth the false prophets by the way you can tell a false prophet all they talk about is how much God loves you and wants to bless you they never tell you that you should repent they never talk about sin or judgments sound familiar and the prosperity gospel is nothing new the Old Testament is full of false prophets who misled God's people who frankly all people of all time have one theme when they come when it comes to hearing someone speak for God is a theme of the song is tell me something good tickle my ears you know and it's not that God doesn't love you he doesn't want to bless you but there is a call to repentance and all through the Old Testament that was the problem the false prophets would not say that with the true prophets would and they were persecuted for it so here's watchman God's Watchmen those profits are blind a little bit of a problem if your watchman is supposed to be warning you about the enemy coming is blind they are all ignorant they're all here it is dumb dogs or mute dogs they can't mark sleeping lying down loving to slumber and so here the false prophets not willing to speak the true and full word of God and in a sense this is what Paul has calling the judaizers now who were the judaizers these were Jewish Christians who would follow Paul wherever he would go to Gentile cities where Paul would preach gospel Gentiles non Jews would get saved and they would then come in and say well it's good that you believe in our Messiah Jesus he is God's savior of the world it's good that you want to receive him but if you want to be a Christian you first need to become a Jew you must be circumcised and you must keep the law of Moses and only then will Jesus be of any value to you so they basically taught a works salvation you're saved by the finished work of Christ and what you do for him and Paul was constantly dealing with these dogs look up Matthew 23 verse 13 Matthew 23 13 now Jesus here is speaking to the Pharisees and the scribes and these are not the ranks centers of society these are the religious leaders these are the people that let other people and told them how", "to worship God whenever you read the word whoa in the Bible please no you need a different definition than the way we read it Jesus is not saying woe to his horse he's not saying woe the way a lot of people do it oh woe is me well he's not an Eeyore here when a prophet uses the word whoa older New Testament it is a divine pronouncement listen to me of judgment God's judgment on who he's speaking to so that's why when Isaiah says woe is me he's speaking judgment to himself in Isaiah 6 normally he say what other people chapters 1 45 but here Jesus has low to you and there are the eight woes of Matthew 23 the Jesus levels at the religious leaders and why is it well here's one of them what do you scribes the experts in the law and you Pharisees you separate ones your actors you're hypocrites you shut off the kingdom of heaven from people for you do not enter it yourself nor do you allow those who are entering to go in so that the dogs like the Pharisees were people that had rules they were laying on people kind of head trips he calls them here the evil workers now by the way when he went when he calls them dogs most of our experience you know you have a pet dog at home you're a little Rover my dog's name is Molly she's sweet except when she pees in the house and we love our dogs they're like part of our family don't get that idea here dogs in the ancient world were scavengers they were wild they were diseased they ate garbage and they were infectious and they were rabid so Paul is really a very severe word which is interesting by the way because the Jews called the Gentiles dogs but here's Paul calling these Judaizers Christians now you've got the dogs because you are evil workers you're trying to add something that someone has to do to the simple gospel in order to be saved may I say to you that much of Christianity's history way too much of it and still to this day much of Christendom teaches a perverted gospel say what do you mean it teaches that you need to believe in Jesus and what he's done and you need to live a life that's worthy in order to be saved this is common teaching if you grew up in the catholic church that is Catholicism but it's not just Catholicism I was a Lutheran a Lutheran's on the other side of the Protestant Reformation if you", "know the issues of the Protestant Reformation you know that the monks Martin Luther being one of them called the Catholic Church to repent and reform and go back to the Bible with the Bible is very clear if you read Romans if you read Galatians that we're saved by grace through faith alone not works the church didn't want to be reformed you need to believe in Jesus and you need to keep the seven sacraments of the Church or you will not be saved period but the Protestant church became corrupted as well even though they started out teaching with the Bible teaches by the time I come along hundreds of years after the Protestant Reformation Here I am attending a Lutheran Church but I came up believing the same thing that it what really matters is how I live my life as to whether I'll be safe listen I learn to play solitaire as a kid you want to learn here how I learned to count the cards it was like this little ditty that I was given you you put a delicate one two three four five six seven all good children go to heaven if they swear they don't go there one two three four five six seven perfect for solitaire horrible for salvation that is bankrupt theology but it actually was mine I absolutely believed the reason I was going to heaven and Kenny my next-door neighbor wasn't I let him know when a he didn't go to church should be he cut and he said the really bad swear words I just said but not so bad the venial swear words you know I really did that was my theology and it came to me from that little but it was it was believed even if the church i attended a they didn't preach the need to be born again you didn't need to return your sins i was baptized as a baby you just needed to confirm the faith your parents said hey baby you're in just come to church live a good life and you're going to go to heaven that's not what the scripture teaches and paul is very concerned about those who are perverting the clear doctrine of salvation by grace but it's done all the time and studying on by christians who say they know the truth by the way that we live come Wednesday night room talking more about that from the Song of Solomon there's a woman who came to her pastor she said pastor I finally get this it's a relationship a face and works in the Christian life he said what do you mean", "she says well kind of being in a rowboat said huh said yeah yeah you know in a rowboat you have two wars and if you rode them if you roll with both oars you move ahead but if you just try to roll with one you just go in circles she said it's kind of like that in the Christian life there is faith and their his works and he both of those to get where you're going he said that's a great analogy there's just one problem she said what's that he said no one's going to heaven in a rowboat it's absolutely not what Scripture teaches we believe that true faith will issue in good works faith without works is dead but it's not the basis of your salvation what you do then basis of your salvation praise God is what he did what he said it is finished and put in your full faith of that good works flow then in love and appreciation for what he's done Paul will write to the churches plural of Galatia with this question because they were getting into legalistic practices having begun by the spirit would you be perfected by the flesh in other words you got saved by the Spirit of God but now you're thinking you're going to have to add to God favored by doing things to earn it and you're becoming legalistic but he asked them this question where is that sense of blessing that you had in other words where's that joy you that what's flooded your soul but it seems to be moving away you're losing it you ever met a Christian and looked like they were baptized in lemon juice homais might have believed all the right theology and said the right things but it just seemed like there was no joy in their heart at all years ago we took a group back to Washington DC I hope every one of you get to visit our nation's capital some day we went on a spiritual heritage tour to see in our nation's capital where things that happen was amazing we had different tour guides that were all Christians they were all really deep people very knowledgeable on don't forget we we have this one lady older lady got on the bus to talk to us about one of the sites and when I was our first or second day we were all kind of getting to know each other on the bus we didn't know maybe the leaders from the tour she was just gonna be with us for a few hours but she got on the bus", "and she was asking who the leader was and so they said I'll have to Pastor Bob and I was in the back of the bus so I started walking forward to meet her and as I'm walking forward she said to what church is this and somebody's all were from Calvary and she looks at me and she can see how about you goes Oh calvary baptist and I said Calvary Chapel she I know what are their better phones in heaven for the Calvary Baptist Debbie really see but we can get into that to Kent we can fall into thing as loving the kind of church maybe we grew up in and that we are tended to feel like well that's kind of the that's the tester you know some friend moves to another city stop you finally Church you up I hear there's the Calvary Chapel in that town oh I haven't checked it you didn't even check it out you're going to some other church and you call yourself a Christian yeah i mean we could when he get very judgmental it's very easy for us as Christians we think we think somehow that were not but you know Jesus as biggest problems we're not with the sinful people who knew they were sinners he was compassionate and gracious to them but his harshest words were for the religious folk who looked down at everybody else and Paul's greatest concerns calling them Doug are for those believers who are self-righteous and are trying to get other people you see this was their problem they were content just to practice their Christianity their own way they wanted everybody else to do it the same you know Jesus was often probably looked at as someone who didn't teach the whole truth of the Bible did you know that so Paul they didn't teach the whole truth say what do you mean well remember they were offended at Jesus that he didn't honor the Sabbath he was working on this out for because he was healing people that's a violation of the Sabbath but are you kidding me that was your their opinion oh yeah we gotta wash your hands I don't mean this dirty wash your hands before you ever had watched your head it a prescribed away even if your hands are crystal clean you have to do it in a prescribed way before you eat and a Bible didn't command that but the traditions of the elders did and Jesus refused to submit himself to man's rules refused to because there's something about that that starts to create the sense of a", "false righteousness impulsive listen Paul was accused by the Judaizers of what we would call easy believe ism what's easy believe ism easy believe ism is this teaching that well just pray and ask Jesus into your heart doesn't matter how you live doesn't matter what you do because frankly you know you can live for the double but if you prayed that prayer your fire insurance you're now listen you can see where that can be taught based on the fact that we're saved by grace through faith problem is the Bible doesn't teach that the bible does teach that if we're truly saved works will follow and we should deceive ourselves if we're living in sittin thinkin that we're saved and many will say to me on that day Lord Lord did we not prophesy in your day but we went to church that we heal I don't say I never do you depart from me you workers of iniquity you have deceived yourself well the scripture is full of warnings to people who think they're saved when they're not but it's not that you're saved because you do you see that's very easy to make this mistake so Paul was be accused of you're making it too easy on people you need them to come under the law of Moses now we look at that we say well that's horrible that he did that the fact is we can we can fall in together as well put this down move out of religion into rejoicing out of religion into releasing Christianity is not a list of do's and don'ts now maybe yours has been maybe you grew up in a Christian home you came to church maybe this church and you said well a lot of Christians handle this well Christians aren't allowed to do this and they are allowed to do that and you know that kind of changes over time so let's check in now what the current thing is or Christians will have to dance this week or we are you know allowed see these kind of movies are you know there's a whole socialization for Christians that can become lack of socialized holiness where it's motivated by fitting in and being acceptable rather than out of a love for the Lord that's dangerous stuff jot down Romans 14 and verse 17 Romans 14 deals with Christians who disagree with each other about whether you can eat meat offered to idols and then pulse is this the kingdom of God is not eating and drinking what was that mean we got to cancel the potlucks no he's not just", "talking about going out to eat and drinking he's talking about eating certain foods and not eating certain foods and drinking certain things I'm not drinking the kingdom of God is not about rules but it's about righteousness and peace and joy in the Holy Ghost now listen and he says it's about righteousness he's not talking about you living right place thought what he means he's talking about a righteousness that God gives you when you believe because the same author who wrote that a few chapters earlier in Romans 5 to this having been made righteous or justified by faith we have peace with God the kingdom of God is not eat or drink but its righteousness a gift a standing before God that you don't deserve and I don't either and then a piece that flows from that wife because I'm I mean declared righteous I don't have to worry about damnation that's Romans 8 1 no condemnation for me its righteousness and then a resulting piece and then a resulting joy and the Holy Ghost through the spirit as it fills your life you see so we need to move away from earls you say well how think we really have too many rules the problem is we don't tend to see our own little rules didn't we not have rules about eating sure we do you go out to lunch with some Christians after today you go to a restaurant you sit down go down to Donald's ace now what's the rule the rule is you need to pray before you eat the meal because if you don't you're going to poison yourself no it's just the right thing to do and I agree it's right to give things so our rules are you pray somebody offers to pray or you'll pay separately before you eat your enchilada let the I guess those are pre blessed in the back room you do not have to pray for tortilla chips and hey if you go for frozen yogurt or baskin robbins don't prayer to eat it for that either just that's just heavenly food I guess now you think Bob do you think we should pray for I'm said we have weird standards that we come up with that if you're sitting with a bunch of Christians that nobody plays like wow don't think I don't know if they know the Lord you know I me and pray can I tell you a little something just to make it even harder for us got it really care about your prayer he cares about your heart and there are plenty of people who", "pray that prayer or a prayer and they're not thankful at all and God sees it better to be thankful in your heart and receive it with joy than to pray a prayer where you don't mean a word of it we're trying to be heard it really we get into rules you know we're all in a big group we're gonna pray for a meeting the end of the prayer squeeze twice somebody doesn't squeeze it's like a backslidden that's wrong don't you learned Christian squeeze twice where's that booklet and there are many many many other things that we do that we just don't even notice it happens very easily where we start to judge other people based on our own perception put this down it has to start in your heart put in the word heart look at the text he says there in verse to the end beware the false circumcision we are the true circumcision now there's a play on words that Paul is doing in the Greek that doesn't come into the English here between the word false circumcision and true circumcision just two Greek words but the first word he uses doesn't really translate circumcision at all it would be better translated the mutilation beware of the musician say why would he say that well because here's what Paul is doing he's saying these guys that are going around trying to get people circumcise all they're doing is mutilating them this word that he uses in verse to fall circumcision in the Greek is used twice in the Old he said I thought the Old Testament was written in Hebrew it was but it was translated into Greek about the 3rd century BC and what's known as the Septuagint and this was the Bible of the first century this word that he uses for false circumcision once in Leviticus once in first kings 18 describes people that are literally cutting themselves to worship their foreign gods God commands his people you don't cut yourselves like the pagans do you're not allowed to do that and in first Kings it's that contest on Mount Carmel between Elijah and the prophets of Baal remember those 450 prophets were given the option of going first to pray for the fire that never came and first they asked their God to send fire and then they start chanting that they could I God's not answering because there's no God there to answer so they start Jabba themselves of blood is everyday just really into it nothing happens but it's that word here it's the mutilation that's what he called we're trying to add something to", "what Christ is that you cannot take something that's perfect and add anything to it without making it imperfect or impure you can't even if it's a good work you're destroying the work that's what he's saying we have the mutilation and we have the true circumcision true believers are truly circumsized spiritually is the idea this idea of circumcision that which was given to Abraham as a sign of the Covenant later instituted in the law as every Jewish boy on the eighth day of their birth after birth would be circumcised to in that most private area to say this boy's been set apart and he's accepting the Covenant of Abraham but even in the Old Testament God was already talking with people about how just the symbol itself means nothing if that's all it is for instance in Jeremiah God caused calls his people uncircumcised of ears they're not hearing the Word of God in the book of Exodus he speaks of them as having uncircumcised lips Stephen in the New Testament says to the Jewish leaders in Israel your hearts are uncircumcised see real circumcision was a devotion of the heart and the mind and the life to God jot down Deuteronomy 30 and verse 6 moreover the Lord your God will circumcise your heart he's talking to people who had been circumcised he will circumcise your heart and the heart of your descendants to love the Lord your God with all your heart all your soul so that you may live the problem was bringing Christians into an application of the law the law of which was only preparatory for Christ the law was to get them ready to receive Christ who is the fulfillment of the law by the way that's why as Christians we don't teach you need to honor the Sabbath day to keep it holy you said that's why I'm here you kind of miss it it was yesterday Sabbath never will never can be Sunday just so you know it's always been Shabbat Saturday you can't just move it because it's convenient on your calendar next day he rested this is Monday in Israel it always will be the first day of the week it's when Jesus rose from the dead but jesus is our Sabbath rest that's Hebrews he is the fulfillment of what that old testament law was it just looked forward to him circumcision in the body looked forward to a circumcision that the Holy Spirit would do read Romans too if you want more background on this he is a Jew who is one inwardly circumcision as that", "which is of the heart by the spirit not by the by the law and his praises not from men but from God it starts in the heart that's why the psalmist said I delight to do your Will O God your law is within my head no he didn't say that he said your laws within my heart you remember how God in the Old Testament promised a new covenant this is Jeremiah and the New Covenant would be the God who had written his laws on stones and external commands that because people were to try to conform their life too and they were unsuccessful blahhhh was never never came to make man holy it came to make man speechless I can't do it that God who first played his law on stones in the New Covenant but he pours out his spirit upon all flesh was gonna write his law on men's hearts so they wouldn't want to obey God you see not have to obey God but desire to it's my ambition to be pleasing to the Lord Paul says and so this change that happened i think that the difference where i should say the distance between damnation and salvation for a lot of people is about 18 inches say what do you mean it's the distance between the head and the heart it's happened over in England in a city called lead some years ago there was an elderly man he he was hard of hearing he wore a hearing aid but still his hearing wasn't very good and his children and his grandchildren for years and said please go get checked out something's wrong and he just didn't deal with it finally they made him an appointment they were so irritated because he had so much trouble hearing and they said we're taking you in we don't care what you want you where you're going so they took a man when when the audiologist took the hearing aid out of his ear he heard better here was the discovery he needed a hearing aid in the other ear 20 years he had been wearing the right equipment in the wrong place and I think there are many many many Christians or at least those who call themselves such on this earth who have received Jesus into their heads you have him you believe all the right things you could recite as I could the Nicene Creed the Apostles Creed Bible theology a hundred percent agree that Jesus Christ was not alive in you you've never received him you've never been born again it starts in the heart and", "it's a work of God put this down he says they worship in the spirit no this does not mean to sing in tongues true believers worship in the spirit see worship for many people historically it even to this day people think it's about worshipping in a particular place you can't worship the lecture on the right place come in a holy place church or synagogue yet you worship there and yet that is so not true it wasn't even in the Old Testament look in a week from this Wednesday that can our heading over to Israel 50 kids with marks where you go all over the Holy Land we're have a whole giant or but I can tell you one place that we're not going to see though I know it's holy see in Exodus 3 when God meant Moses at the burning bush he said take off your sandals Moses because the place that you're standing is what hole you know on you're not going to go there Bob nope that is not in Israel that's over in Midian we're not going there because you see what makes something wholly is not that it's in Israel what makes something holy is that it's set apart for God or God Himself is there and that means wherever God is where it might be in your backyard it might be in your ganna might be on your in your car and sitting on the 91 saying what's with this you can be with God and God's Spirit could show up and make that a holy moment your life it's about being with the Lord we don't worship because of its a particular location you know that was the problem between the Jews and the Samaritan when Jesus was talking to the woman at the well she asked this question well you know I Samaritans and you Jews we have this debate because you guys think you're supposed to worship there at the Temple in Jerusalem but not Samaritans we say it's up here I'm not Gerizim and you remember what Jesus said to work jotted down John 4 and verse 23 an hour is coming and it now is true worshipers will worship the father in spirit and in truth for such people the father seeks to be his worshipers say worship is not something that you and I do for God it's something that God does in us he makes us worshipers and it is my prayer the Calvary Chapel east anaheim we would grow in our capacity I love worshipping but I think god is so much more for us I really want our", "church to be a worship center for this whole community I want to be a place where we regularly come and experience passionate praise and we're God's presence every week is obvious God's power is being manifested people will fall down and say God is in your midst because i believe the joy of the lord comes you'll see on the day of Pentecost when they were filled with the Holy Spirit they were filled with joy they were talking about Jesus and exalting God the Father put this down into three finally were to exalt pricey I said that word finally and in closing but in the word exalt Christ because in the text and the end of verse 3 he said this they we glory in Christ Jesus and here's the other side of that we put no confidence in the flesh you know the pride of man is never impressed with anything or anyone but itself and we are impressed with ourselves we want other people to be impressed with us it's our nature and don't try to pretend you don't don't be proud of the fact you're so modest we all have that I'm that way too and it's a problem because those who are here described as worshippers in the spirit who are the true circumcision they glory in Jesus Christ below heard a story of a guy who was down at the beach he was just going to look at the ways another man came up with his dog and the guy with the dog on the beach right standing next to the other man the man with the dog took a stick through it out into the waves and the dog ran out on top of the water got the stick and brought it back kind of was watching was a little bit amazed by that and then the men notice the other guy was watching so he took the stick even so it further out all began went right on top of the water top the stick brought it back and finds a guy with the dog learn leading order that guy who said you notice we thinking different about my dog because yeah he can't swim Kenny that's kind of the nature of pride what I'm going to do something that's gonna put a smile on your face I'm gonna earn your blessing in my life and even if we don't think we're saying that so much of the time that's the way we're acting but jot down Ephesians 2 8 and 9 for by grace in other words unmerited favor you didn't get it you didn't earn it by anything", "you've done by grace you have been saved through faith and that matter yourselves it is a gift of God it's not a result of anything you're doing are done and so that no one can boast in themselves remember when the Philippian jailer broken because the walls had come down he was ready to take his life he almost did pulsa do yourself no harm we're all here and he came down he knelt down before Paul and Silas and he said this he said brethren what should I do to be saved what do I need to do to be saved and that is the eternal question we want to get people to that place what do I need to do people are probably I'm ready to do anything I'll go kill the seven-headed dragon for God I'll do whatever but the answer to that question is not behave it's belief that's what Paul said believe and you and your whole family anybody can be saved if you'll just believe you see what what works should we be doing to do the works of God they asked Jesus here's the work singular believe on Him whom he has sent well I want to skip over that I already believe I want to do something we're so ready to do and so often we haven't really come to believe Fanny Crosby one of the greatest Tim writers of all time she was born seeing but would be blinded as a baby actually her mother had a doctor come the doctor put a mustard poultice on her forehead in it during the night fell down into her eyes and she was blinded for life but she was never bitter about that she used to say if you could give me my site today I wouldn't take it she said I think because I've been blind it's affected me I I can study better I can actually remember more she memorized Genesis Exodus Leviticus and numbers Matthew Mark Luke and John by the time she was ten and she wrote eight thousand hymns one of those is familiar with to God be the glory great things he has done so loved the world that He gave us the son who yielded his life and atonement for sin and he opened what she called the life gate so that all may go in now Jesus told a parable about obedient slaves that will come to their master at the end and he'll say and or the joy of your master we look forward to that day but can I say something as a Christian please don't", "think you have to wait to enter the joy of your master till you get to heaven see jesus told his disciples to go out and preach the gospel heal diseases raise the dead cast out demons and he says when you're done preaching in a city he said you make sure you tell them everyone who heard the gospel you say this the kingdom of God has come near you the kingdom of God has come near you Jesus would also say strive to enter by the narrow door see Jesus himself is heavens narrow gate that is wide open to everybody there's an occasion when the scribe comes to Jesus and he asks what the greatest commandment is and Jesus says the greatest commandment is to love God your whole being and to love your neighbor as yourself and the scribe says you're right what's interesting describer good one you know radio like he's the expert telling Jesus and I love what it says them Jesus looks at this man who recognizes that that is right and he says you know you're not far from the kingdom of God wow that's pretty awesome but being close to the kingdom is not the same as being in the kingdom and I think there are many people who have the right information but have never acted on it Jesus opened the life gate so that all they go in the light gates wide open the question is have you ever gone in are you willing to come in are you willing as jesus said I am the door of the sheep who go in and out through me and are saved come yet let's pray father how I thank you that you didn't just send Jesus to be an example because if that's all he was we would just walk with our heads hung down realizing we can't even come close to living that way the Lord you send them to be our Savior our Redeemer and Lord Jesus because you are alive from the dead you've had big 30 verse in andover death we come to you for forgiveness but we come to you to fill us a fresh with
